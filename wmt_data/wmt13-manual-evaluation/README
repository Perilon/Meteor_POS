This directory contains the results of WMT13 manual (human) evaluation
in the file "wmt13-judgments.csv". For more information, see the WMT13
Overview paper. That and this data can be found on the WMT13 results
page: statmt.org/wmt13/results.html .

The first line of this file is a header defining the following
fields. This is the "WMT" format. Many of the fields are no longer
used, but we have kept the same format to keep things consistent
across the past few years of the manual evaluation. The fields are:

- {src,trg}lang: the source and target language
- srcIndex: the sentence number (1-indexed)
- documentId: not used (set to -1)
- segmentId: the sentence number (same as srcIndex)
- judgeId: the anonymized judge name. Researchers and Turkers are
  distinguished.
- system[12345]Number: not used (set to -1)
- system[12345]Id: the system name (e.g., newstest2013.es-en.JHU.2776)
- system[1234]rank: the rank the judge assigned to this task 
  (1 is best, 5 is worst)

New this year, we also provide a script for analyzing the data, which
could be useful in diagnosing problems with a particular
system. "visualize.py" displays all sentences for a language pair for
which judgments were found, sorting the systems for each segment by
their aggregate ranks.

To use, first download the WMT13 raw data and set the $WMT13
environment variable:

    wget -q http://statmt.org/wmt13/wmt13-data.tar.gz
    tar xf wmt13-data.tar.gz
    export WMT13=$(pwd)/wmt13-data

This environment variable is used by the visualization script.

Usage: visualize.py [-path PATH_TO_WMT_DATA] [-judge PREFIX] JUDGMENTS LANGPAIR

where
  - PATH_TO_WMT_DATA is where you downloaded the WMT system outputs
    (available on the WMT13 results page)
  - PREFIX is a judge name prefix (field 6). By default, all judgments from
    the judgments file are included, but you can, for example,
    restrict this to only researchers (or turkers) by using "researcher"
    or "turker", respectively.
  - JUDGMENTS is the file containing judgments (e.g,. "wmt13-judgments.csv".
  - LANGPAIR is the language pair.

e.g.,

    $ python visualize.py wmt13-judgments.csv de-en | less
    SENTENCE 1

    [0.00] A Republican strategy to confront the re-election of Obama [JHU]
    ...

The bracketed score is the percentage of time the system *on that
sentence* was judged to be better than the other systems it was
compared to in pairwise comparisons.
