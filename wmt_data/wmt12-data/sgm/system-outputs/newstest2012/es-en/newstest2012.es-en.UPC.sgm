<seg id="1">The victory of Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The history of the liberation of Libya, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muammar el-Qaddafi from was buried in a secret location in the desert, and without it there is no longer any war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It remains to determine who is the winner</seg>
<seg id="5">As is usual in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but it is now a question of whether it is moderate or radical</seg>
<seg id="6">The National Transitional Council has done to enter into force customary law, sharia law, which already somewhat familiar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves were cut off the hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women already can be forgetting to emancipate and apostates awaiting execution and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Instead of the person of the dictator, society, consisting of warlike tribes, will join in the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Libya will establish an order that we can not even imagine, and they certainly can not.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, our way of life is neither the sole nor objectively the best and probably did not suit them, instead, to the Libyans already mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fact is that it is not surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of dogs infidels.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only justification was that, in his view, the attacks of NATO not led an American general, but large Allah, whose greatness held after each of the successful interventions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">When you pick winners in Libya, the West is not among them.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are caught in a firefight which is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, not militarily occupy Libya.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this case, you will not be a problem to expel the "Crusaders"</seg>
<seg id="18">But, without occupation will get the oil to grab the black gold in Libya with just fine words?</seg>
<seg id="19">It is quite possible that no, but it may be that the West can boast to protect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="20">Whenever the followers of Sharia law are not cross.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">In the table, obsessive children feed, for example, sausage at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.</seg>
<seg id="6">For dinner, more than 19 percent of the obese had dined chips on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention programme "obesity is not a coincidence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In families of overweight children, there is no tradition of sports, which is applicable to the majority of families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, found time for physical exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Survey of 900 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The survey was conducted at the end of the last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of Basic Education throughout the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was the second edition of the programme of "obesity is not a coincidence," which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.</seg>
<seg id="11">Until now, they have participated in the project over 12 000 children from the 4th to the 8th grade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">A proper diet and exercise in family are determining factors that make a marked decrease in the number of overweight children and even obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"only half of all children surveyed have responded with five daily meals as the regime: breakfast, lunch, dinner, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the results of the survey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Without breakfast but with sausage for dinner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Experts warn that, in a healthy development, are also important details, which also include, for example, have a fixed time for breakfast in family.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In the majority of families, desayuna each alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the worst was to discover that in 10% of households are not desayuna nothing.</seg>
<seg id="19">The breakfast, however, is the basis of a correct daily diet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The study shows that the families of obese children are consumed with much more often unhealthy chips.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost everyone - regardless of the weight - drink daily soft drinks, sweets (70%).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">As a general rule make sport more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this outcome will be reduced to less than half, only 15%.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The stylist also has to be a good psychologist, maintain professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the chapeau article, how they learn the stylists, because I complained a bit of that initial lessons were already quite loaded.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had no idea how to run things.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conferences of three professionals, how to dress characters problematic and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer they are final exams, more information and practical tasks await us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, is no longer a pin.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have studied with the Director, Alena (in no man) on how to dress women who do not have a perfect symmetry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And that is the great majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone cuellicorto is, somebody has a stylized without adequate curves and someone is overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The stylist has to know about shoulders relaxed optically gauges, drag a neck or recreate the necessary curves</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, breasts and hips enormous but waist close and at the same time I do not dress the too defiant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers are not adapted, can be stitched together at least an extra piece of cloth to measure.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly not repent, because the clothes that feel perfectly is unaffordable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">With a skirt to measure will feel much better than with a not for moving, lifted, danced in the waist, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The body can allow stylized clothes with folds, trimmings and embroidery or drapeados.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are certainly many types of information and various bodies, so I am glad to have the whole week in order to put my head all this information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even so, I fear that the task, because I have more than well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each participant in the workshop was assigned two famous, that he will have to design two wardrobes: one for the day and another for the night.</seg>
<seg id="20">We must take into account the current aspect, the fashionable style to suit the individual in question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I won "dress" to Miranda Kerr, perhaps you speak of the campaign of Victoria Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Cry from the inside, for me, is much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who lately have fattened around 100 kilos (please, take into account the overstatement), or jovencísima Selena Gomez. '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes have to cut from magazines or search the internet and print, and then develop graphically.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is as moodboard, which called for the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is also important to think in the part of the graphic styling.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stylist, therefore, is not only physically, but is also involved, for example, of the pages of products in the magazines (of specific items, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">It told us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But all that is already on the Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The stylist has to have a global vision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The three guests specialists inspired the Conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The stylist Honza POKORNÝ, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know to capitalise on this.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a good stylist knows to work with the same piece of clothing in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variability is, in this case, essential.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As well as gabardina (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be a classic clothing with jeans and T-shirt, but also serves to wear the naked body with tacón shoes and photograph it as if it were in fact a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or well enough to roll up our sleeves and get the neck for a totally different picture.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Jugad with this," we insisted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">What we value most is the following advice: "to start work, first may know all the rules."</seg>
<seg id="39">"then we can break them," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, I was clear why memorizamos all those formulas, which combines with what, why, then, is that in the fashion magazines are different results.</seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention the parades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve of which aims to photograph.</seg>
<seg id="43">Well, for a history of fashion that takes ten pages, therefore, outfits (10), we must be prepared, ready to use at least fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And in addition to the photos clothing works in combination with other clothes, all of which are different from those used in the reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">All of this must be taken into account when designing outfit the.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Honza POKORNÝ assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of the success.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary Singer, but the image márquetin and have made her a Global Star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear trend to use the services of the stylists.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even the famous people also are useless (I am enough my abilities, my physical appearance is not so much importance).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And when someone asks us our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely to indicate a height very different from yours real (minor).</seg>
<seg id="51">Then there is just guglear and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened / thinned, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">On Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the stylist was not enough focus on fashion, but we must understand of outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">During his work, especially should be communicated with the people that dresses, which is why it is essential to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">He knows the people, not less, defends his views.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"when a Director os recruits for clasifiquéis clothing and apparel completéis with fine, you can not catch and throw everything and say:" Oh What horror. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"Encontrad at least a couple of things that you can weigh and recommend to anyone they can get," said Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He also showed us that everything should be on the so-called "placovka", i.e., the job market.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is set around the waist and they are there all the necessary tools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">They are objects like scissors, scissors, or like quitapelusas imperdibles. There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the meeting of photos of products such as handbags or hats), special clamps lure of clothes ahead, if this were increased (the very weak and other connections are not permitted, because it could damage the fabric), or a game of sewing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">For we are not left in the passive listening and put something in practice, we have learned to take the usually of shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even during the meetings of photos in the study, in a flat surface, it could damage the often and much more still outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And we did not do more to come in and take.</seg>
<seg id="63">We could not touch the shoes with scissors in order not to damage by accident.</seg>
<seg id="64">So we had to be very clever.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservations.</seg>
<seg id="66">The truth is that it does not give me very well these skills.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is just a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.</seg>
<seg id="68">I have already realised that devote myself to the styling at professional level is not a bed of roses, but I get exactly like what people say.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Need for Speed: The Run will compete across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Overview</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">A carefree travel, in principle, is complicated because of a series of careless talk of a routine trip during the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">To some extent they managed to meet the expectations, but it serves no purpose, if, in fact, was not intended to do anything extraordinary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new delivery, which is added to the title The Run, awakened great expectations before its premiere.</seg>
<seg id="6">It promised to provide oxygen to the old saga of racing Need for Speed and, upon shown, appears as a game that should not end up being another kind of action.</seg>
<seg id="7">We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on their own feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results do not vary much about what we expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are races that can be taken by acceptable, but the total lost points because of absurd rulings, which have already appeared on the series for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">In reality can not be called mistakes, but rather the unwillingness of incomprehensible programmers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ye introduces a history, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to resolve, it offers participating in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">Os sentáis at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea is to offer something interesting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into ten stages, and then, in more than 50 races.</seg>
<seg id="16">It follows that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="17">That way, you do not have anything like the feeling that the game always offers the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the figure is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the walk across the desert landscape, the seasonal or high mountains covered in snow produce a very pleasant visual impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In addition, the races diversify from time to time by an atypical element.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, for example, in the desert os encontráis a sandstorm reduced visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">In contrast, in the mountains should beware lest Ye Mr Tortora himself an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">According to that, every one of the races is very well developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are only a couple of models, but this is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a time, trying to beat a number of rivals required (normal in a classic race), after trying to gain time (classic duel timed) and then you looked a duel against a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the midst of all this is sometimes the police, but that does not make things even further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The novelty is the landscape outside the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">Interactive animations are presented as Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always clicking the button just at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game of what might be expected (in particular, there are only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">But the end result is positive, because this element is not to be upset and, in the aforementioned context, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model of leadership follows in the footsteps of the previous episodes.</seg>
<seg id="34">That means that already today is not a great thing, but it can not be said to be bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">If buscáis a realistic simulation, because you can look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But in a race designed with enough action is quite this style of leadership, although we can find something better between Games of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, so good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the problems arise after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the correctness of the models of leadership, the same is not true for collisions.</seg>
<seg id="40">Games of this kind can not expect recreated deformities and complicated collisions, but in fact before a coup against any object, you can not predict how your car, not everything is in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is typical that, to make a very tight overtaking or move the car with a normal traffic, has only slight friction, but in other situations almost identical, your car is just doing gymnastics got out of control.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even just totally destroyed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system of reseteo, no major problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those are programmed reseteos so that when you suffer an accident or salts of the runway, the game te restores to rescue the last point on the runway.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, in each race reseteos only has five available.</seg>
<seg id="46">If the, consumís all need to restart the race from the start.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus it is no more than a help in the event that something does not go well, but it is not very reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, the only help reseteo aid, learning the given phase of memory.</seg>
<seg id="49">A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.</seg>
<seg id="50">In some curves, for example, we need to go in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Other times os encontráis somewhere vehicles "civilians" always with the same configuration, although you are the first, fifth or lleguéis five minutes before or after.</seg>
<seg id="52">This makes rage, especially in situations when you see that two cars are going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent premises without problems, but when you have arrived, you must be either slow.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is like when lleguéis, because it is scheduled for the "surprise" always happen in front of your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents also have an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game llegaréis at sites, without taking into account the time, you always advance the same opponent at the same site.</seg>
<seg id="56">In addition, this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more striking.</seg>
<seg id="57">Your opponent must come before you, whatever the cost.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it is in front of you, you makes the vision of cars that come from the front, so that you can make porridge at the start of the car.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">One can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you straight away.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is a pity, because although the model of the voyage is simple, the game is fun and action, so it is often not possible to continue to detail what happens or where.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is truly equal, if the credit is carried the idea with fifty exclusive leads or the classification in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must be alert to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because it is going to have to change their car, but in the vast majority of cases os is what you get.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for motorways and superdeportivos exotic straight for a technical leadership, for example, by winding mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Besides narrative thread lead is also a thread of parallel challenges, i.e., there are careers in specific locations to be known by the stories.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here conseguiréis not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both to the challenges as tales.</seg>
<seg id="68">To reach the upper level, the driver was open several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds for the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the same time, there is a role Autolog connected online, which compare your results with those of other players and disponibiliza other Community functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the most difficult to understand how this is done the last race in history.</seg>
<seg id="71">With the car arrived until the subway tunnel (pass), where os ponéis run dark lanes (pass).</seg>
<seg id="72">The speedometer os marks between 150 and 200 km / h (pass), and suddenly you come from behind the convoy of the subway and ye leads ahead without further.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the language we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, whether during the programming of the game a little or none thought even if the authors of truth is taken by a bunch of stupid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side of the game is not unusual, but at least the general visual effects are in the majority of cases pleasant, sometimes so impressive.</seg>
<seg id="75">Because it is a shame that, in the most tense moments reduces the quality of image and, sometimes, in a serious way.</seg>
<seg id="76">This particularly affects the accidents where there are involved many participants, when the quality of continuous view is no longer valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In order to make it palatable to the bulk of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother," but it can be assumed that nobody would buy the game only for his music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The final sense of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game avoids absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have problems in asserting that The Run is the best game of NFS of recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">This gives the impression that the game is not over.</seg>
<seg id="82">The fun is insured, but ready because the mistakes you attack in the eyes with the force of some floodlights of airport.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs have a reputation for negativistas and Eurosceptics.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">"the Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I did not expect to be montase an all-out war."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the last five, six years ago, before the situation will be stabilized somewhat, calming and new players are accustomed to their new roles," it began its conference at the Faculty of Law, the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How does not take seriously its slogan "clearly and openly about Europe," he said in the first part of its Conference, when it managed to describe each body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, that would be the envy of many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Vicenová also balanced the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"First comes the criticism, if it is a dull, grey official, capable of taking any role, but I have to say that left everyone perplexed, because their roles for perfection."</seg>
<seg id="9">"He is a man that you can listen to the members of the 27 States, to communicate with them, and which has a clear vision of where the EU should go."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new post of Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy explained to the question: "who is this EU? What number can draw?" It is an important step towards unifying and clarifying the political union of states such as China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">No one wants to ban the cheese of Olomouc</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Vicenová has also worked on the agenda was, is and will continue to the European Council in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs were emerging from the economic crisis, resolved the crisis of the gas and hosted a summit for the Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the Government at the time were identified as a highly negative aspect, which were heavily affected by the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU has at the moment many commitments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the Ambassador: "a good fuss", not just the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the other hand, we must approve the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the budget is more simple and effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and less? This is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Ambassador also recalled its main slogans, which arrived in Europe: "about Europe with clarity."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The truth is that I do not like the Ugly abbreviations, extranjerismos or jargon that people do not understand."</seg>
<seg id="22">"How can a citizen understand that Brussels was not invented of truth cucumbers curved cucumbers, bananas or round of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban the cheese of Olomouc?".</seg>
<seg id="23">It aims to get more of the atmosphere of the EU and to bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We hoped the Europe of the speeds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive rather negative aspects that the positive.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is the fault of a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support from the Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, highlighted the strength and the collaboration of the Visegrad Group.</seg>
<seg id="29">"believe me that when they come to me a Pole and a Hungarian and me as a Slovak, a French at my side, I said:" What you have been, already, of the Visegrad Group? ", and she did not do him no mercy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the future, the EU, as Vicenová, faces new regulations unforgiving of budgetary policy for the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is perceived as a very real concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new "the European Federation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We need countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."</seg>
<seg id="34">"He said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and not to be left out."</seg>
<seg id="35">"These procedures will be increasingly and reinforce the two-speed Europe", it is hoped Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this sense, it also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues that affect the entirety of the EU should be discussed among Member States, not just between the members of the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brand story:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovative IBM enters its second century of existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If someone to seek an end to define precisely the strategy of IBM, the closer it would be "long term".</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, have already passed 100 years since its inception.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this nature largoplacista was the first head of the signature, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.</seg>
<seg id="6">Already he coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to believe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Its slogan "Think!" became his trademark, around which will build the life of the future giant, was also the title of an internal newsletter that IBM launched in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">Watson was also the basis of an enterprise culture carefully lifted.</seg>
<seg id="9">"For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and prospered over 100 years for that reason, because he stuck to its basic principles, but without fear about the changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">This has enabled us during our first century, transforming technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope to prosper even more in our second century, "said during its anniversary, the current director of the company, Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A sophisticated system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, already in the 1930s, was worried about the care of their employees as the operator of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators were paid vacation, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewards the best inventors and sellers.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same sophistication long-term maintains IBM in the relationship with the client.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since the beginning, the company failed to identify talent (to be one of the first companies in the world to end discrimination of any kind, could choose without problems).</seg>
<seg id="17">In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, Palmisano to replace the next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">She has worked 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In recent years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, rain of ideas in line, which would provide a myriad of future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not surprisingly for ideas, as in the signature work almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.</seg>
<seg id="23">"from the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company," says the economist, a professor at the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology," said George Colony of the consultancy Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself said there is a difference between going into the business and set up a business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or "the Great Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become the last 100 years in one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both teams as programs, services and infrastructure accommodation website within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).</seg>
<seg id="28">Has the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among their inventions are the ATM, payment cards, swaps, bar codes and diskettes.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM billed this year 220 billion. This year has become the second signature technology by market capitalisation (the first Apple), when it exceeded for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking to the future</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations have just meet the taste of customers and the time (IBM did not bid for its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).</seg>
<seg id="33">"If your business is based in advance, can not be emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms (and equally, if they do not work, the leaves).</seg>
<seg id="35">And this difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically stands and falls exclusively with Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Technology of the future</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In a matter of sales, IBM focuses primarily on services, which are approximately one-fifth of programmes and a fifth of teams.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the quota of suppliers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets with a total value of 15 billion. During the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology of the future.</seg>
<seg id="40">The investments have continued since 2008, when we first expressed the modern global financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM acts according to the tenets of its first Chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">It seems that so far the IBM has managed to weather the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the shares of IBM since the start of the year 2008 has grown estratosféricamente until 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The currency of IBM is to change everything, except its value.</seg>
<seg id="45">It can therefore expect that when the next crisis, this giant flexible tolerate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM History: since the lawnmower cheese until space flight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The International Business Machines (IBM) was founded in New York over a hundred years, with its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The name IBM was already adopted in the year 1924 - originally, this was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The basis which resulted in the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies that date back to the 1880's.</seg>
<seg id="50">He owned inventions like the famous "watch out", to control the entry and exit of employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint file on the head of a company in competition, Thomas J. Watson, to assist with the management of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson remain the bedrock on which underpin the corporate culture and identity.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the company until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, since cutting of meat and cheese until tills.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years that Watson led the company, the turnover doubled over 9 million and began the vast expansion of the company by the continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so crucial to the company, almost forty years after taking the Chair of the head, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s, the staff and the computers of IBM helped NASA to charter flights to the space (Mercury, Saturn and in 1969, the famous flight to the Moon).</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360.</seg>
<seg id="61">The classic "pecés", which introduced the standard computers of that time, reaching the market under the name of the IBM 5150 in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, became part of the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to offer a comprehensive advice and high value-added services.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy has paid IBM these past three years is the concept Smarter Planet, i.e., "a smarter planet."</seg>
<seg id="64">Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, but have not yet been planned areas or improved circumstances, for example, in terms of transport and the administration of cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">For the commercial sector, IBM introduced not long ago the platform "Smart Commerce" that allows retailers to manage the business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a long history in this country.</seg>
<seg id="67">Already in 1932, opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, which was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, the IBM ČR operates along the strategic focus of outsourcing in Brno.</seg>
<seg id="69">The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe have is in Prague. Here, too, there is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.</seg>

<seg id="10">But to see what woman could resist the temptation to walk without further by clothes shops, finding clothes well adjusted and then test them all in the ideally probador (in all different colours)?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But for most women go shopping as a pastime, men can be converted into a virtual hell.</seg>
<seg id="12">Just remember how many times already told her partner that better wait in front of the door.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The constant dissatisfaction</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I am not too fat?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"need to slim at least five kilos - should begin to do exercise?"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Do you really happy?"</seg>
<seg id="17">Does not it sound these phrases?</seg>
<seg id="18">Is that it?</seg>
<seg id="19">It is one of these women obsessed by their appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listen to your partner complain all the time of their physical appearance.</seg>
<seg id="21">The strong sex also agrees that the further increases the frequency of complaints, most embarrassing become women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The order and cleanliness in the first place</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It is like a merry-go-round infinity.</seg>
<seg id="24">Clean the windows, turn the vacuum, mopping the floor, brushing the dust, mopping the bath and all that at least twice a week.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do you blame your partner that you have stepped on the clean soil with a dirty foot, their children have daubed a newly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that both struggled to clean?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">If you experience this "diversion", proved to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that the order and cleanliness probably should not have to be paramount in the family.</seg>
<seg id="27">This desire harmless cleaners could threaten their relationships and family well-being.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Of course, you do not want to say anything bad, just wants to get everything in order.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps, if they knew that men, women, for its part, would not do much commentary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Libel and gossip</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Some women are also the slander, the gossip, but also the offences and conspiracy against someone.</seg>
<seg id="37">Women are concentrated in relations, so I like to talk boards of things like who, where, with whom, how and why.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Perhaps to each one of us is sometimes escapes a small and harmless machine.</seg>
<seg id="39">With hand on heart, that is very nearly all women.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the other hand, there are women that chismosas such unchecked, who love chismorrear and so often, despise all and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female labour force.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The STRIKER hockey Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday at the meeting of NHL with two attendances that brought victory over the Philadelphia 5:3 on the field of Carolina and returned to the Czech players in the vanguard of the competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In both cases, Claude Giroux took the move of the Star of 39 years, and took a step further and was declared the best player in the game.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A while later, also the second intervention of the Czech team had a trail.</seg>
<seg id="10">Voráček was done with the disk behind the goal of Hurricanes' and moved between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who got goals.</seg>
<seg id="11">A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part as Flyers dominated.</seg>
<seg id="12">Specifically by Giroux.</seg>
<seg id="13">After working with Jágr got the third goal, after his shot was colase by the fourth of the goal of Wayne Simmonds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I love playing with him."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I do not want to say who is the best player on the pitch, but was certainly among the best three," balanced Jágr at its plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It never would have occurred to me that at the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman like him."</seg>

<seg id="19">All these years in the game NHL, my colleagues for me, and it now produces results, "Jágr adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Carolina still turned the match in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, of penalty, to be a goal of distance.</seg>
<seg id="21">Matt Read did not allow more complications, but eventually outnumbered two against one.</seg>

<seg id="26">The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, not played until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second quarter withdrew with an injury in the upper part of the body.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defence, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tomáš Plekanec failed to capitalize on one of the shots.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Rather than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injuries in the last row, and play the game with just five defenses.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is bad."</seg>
<seg id="31">"We play the game with just a veteran player, the rest were novice."</seg>
<seg id="32">"In the end, but it is against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Both rotate players turned against us, we could not resist."</seg>
<seg id="34">"We had to simplify further the game, lifting the disk of our countryside."</seg>
<seg id="35">"and so we leave gaps," explained one of the defences, P. K. Subban.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How have evolved prices for travel since 1989.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 in the then Czechoslovakia had only five travel agencies authorized Čedok: State, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies from that time sold in the majority of cases travel only to the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime was inclined towards the West and travel of tourists Czechs were then rather restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (or also Checoeslovacos) are not allowed to travel freely and individually even by the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen wanted to travel alone, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agencies offered in those times also travel to the West, but one should be put to the tail with a Sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the Agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet not everything was won.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the people "politically unreliable", that it could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (currency West) to travel to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, which had a large number of huts and houses of summer, the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The mode of travel of the Czechs has suffered since 1989 a real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Whereas until 1989 for us was the most will not spend their holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs were 4.5 million holiday travel to countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is the great paradox, nna today because we are not aware of the fact that the current favourite destination, Croatia, it was not until 1989 could travel freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of the 1990s was imposed visa exemption for travel to neighbouring States of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially in Vienna or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The long checoeslovacos were not tired of the trips to the West, everybody wanted to see him at least for a time.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris sleeping groups of Czechs in parks in tents, as our income then we were not allowed to pay a hotel or pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was the carry with them, canned food (sausages, etc.) to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living, and also increased the average wages, what about 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With the increased demand for travel agencies began in 1997 with regularity, to prepare the travel using the connections of charter flights, which was incredibly lower prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the 90 of the last century, because the Czechs travelling without a visa in almost all developed countries, except US, which further streamlined our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario happened back in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and went to Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since that year, every year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists was distant countries and hot. This winter is already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">The visit exotic countries currently nearly 100 thousand Czechs per year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our development pos-revolucionario, arrived in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On November 17, 2008, the US removed visas for Czech tourists, so that our country has become among the most developed countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in its history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent on foreign travel more than 15 000 CZK per head, including expenditure on the site of stay.</seg>

<seg id="1">Regular General Assembly convened to elect the President, which could end up again in deadlock.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For nearly five months, the Czech football is without the President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Federation of Soccer Fačr (Czech), will not be known or after the convening of the forthcoming Extraordinary General Assembly, which will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, it has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without them, we can not even vote to choose between three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stakeholders to chair the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hašek resigned his post in June, but not before convening his colleagues with the aim of finding a strong person who knew deal of football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations of the Association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It was revealed on 16 September when he had to be elected as the new President.</seg>
<seg id="9">The General Assembly delegates met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the neighbourhood praguense of Smíchov, because the talks were blocked, and not only in terms of the method of choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">No consensus was reached in terms of who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">From that moment, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, disputes over the electoral Code remain open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">More light on the situation because he could not throw nor the Executive Committee, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of Fačr, which, from the direction of the Association, which represents the professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate with the greatest percentage of support in the Federation to which it will present its candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Region of Moravia is ready to reach a compromise to win that candidate with a greater percentage of total votes in both federations.</seg>
<seg id="19">The part Bohemian, however, under the condition that the winning percentage, according to these calculations, should have the majority of at least two thirds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"This would disagree, however, the connection to the two previous rounds and negate the entire concept of bicameral system, 'Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With this, surprisingly, agrees also Tomaš Paclík, though it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates is in Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I would like to see a vote in the full agreement with the statutes."</seg>
<seg id="23">"so they do not invent any nonsense about the representatives at the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and directing his remarks primarily against Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him, in Nymburk will decide on the new Chairman, and he believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">"All passions are apaciguarán with the Party today of our national team at the European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">"football will again be a player, and it will cooperate more comfortable," said the Representative, Jablonice which of the three candidates has more experience in the management of football, both professional and regional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more reticent.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is not about the conflict between Bohemian and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules at their own convenience."</seg>
<seg id="31">"This can result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Anyway, I hope that common sense," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Because there is not much time for all parties to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations took place in Montenegro, but who can know to start the game if the football team will be complete?</seg>
<seg id="35">The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other vice-chairs Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not emerged this morning by technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the Executive Committee at the venue of the match of classification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The decisive meeting Quizas, finally, could be the one to be held at the ministerial level, to be held this Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">By Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to incorporate the parties split on the most powerful sports organization in the country for an agreement to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="38">The stakes are high: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and also the next General Assembly of the central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport ČSTV) (try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the House of Sazka lotteries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík struggle to reach the Presidency, because it does not find a more suitable candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate to pay all their ideas on the new President of the Russian Football Fačr (Czech), nor is presented as a candidate for a post as relevant.</seg>
<seg id="41">"if there's a good person, he would fight for it, and I would not run as a candidate in elections."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But so far has not been able to find a person as well," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency ČTK) (</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">What motivates to enter the challenge Paclík with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility to block Pelta, the course winner of the elections, which opens the way for the chairmanship of the Federation Cup Fačr (Czech).</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also points out that, if defeated, would remain in the Office of the President only until 2013, when they reached the turn of the general Assembly of hands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In that capacity, he would like to see an expert and a good manager who is not too connected with the football events.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I have already spoken to some people it might take into account."</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this time, do not even want to identify with the Czech football."</seg>
<seg id="48">"I would like to change that vision," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What bothers supposedly more Paclík at this time is the relationship of Pelta with the Chairman of the Football Association Pilsen Regional Berbr Roman, a man with a controversial past, known outside the little world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the Chair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If it wins, it would maintain the current status in football and nothing will change."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with the support of Berbra, a businessman ambitious football will draw even less benefit," said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Also mentions the fact that a few years ago on behalf of Pelta was associated with a telephone tapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, Pelta went unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what the prestige of football could bring the victory of Pelta."</seg>
<seg id="55">"and we will look into the eyes with UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, which also takes some caution with his previous statement that "sell the Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes President."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the case of winning the elections on Thursday Paclík could arise cooperation with Pelta in the future.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the view of another candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly September ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He Pelta () would be the first to be followed."</seg>
<seg id="59">"It is very capable."</seg>
<seg id="60">"I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation."</seg>
<seg id="61">"but not as manager of a partnership."</seg>
<seg id="62">"I do not go the nose where I am not capable," added Paclík, which in September attracted much attention to support the suspension of the Commission of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Marcel, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík admits that dare to manage the partnership.</seg>
<seg id="64">Using their management capacities of private companies, since the summer, was also the Director of the Pilsen, with its support held in May the triumph in the first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the force to change some things in the area of football and contribute to their practice safe."</seg>
<seg id="66">"to reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the Disciplinary Committee and appeal, causing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their antipathy towards the President of the Daniel Křetínský Sparta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">One of the priorities also would be to strengthen the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee Fačr and, with the help of which exerts pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of taxes in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It is one of the key issues that should be the new President."</seg>
<seg id="69">"If increased taxes on gaming, as advertised political parties, support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where you're going to stop all this money," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Now, Paclík Ademas does not even take account of their association with the Club Pilsner, although he claims that the Chairman of the partisan Fačr must be "no".</seg>
<seg id="71">In turn, Pelta is associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">"But I see no connection to cede hypocritically my actions of the Club of Pilsen to another person, and then to return there after a year and a half," said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta Fačr promised the new statutes to end the impasse of the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, would ensure that the new statutes that Fačr have definitely serve to resolve, in the future, the disputes concerning the electoral rules.</seg>
<seg id="76">The representative of Jablonec the is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-electoral conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Even before the elections were not conducted in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely in the representation and raise funds.</seg>
<seg id="78">To participate in the last minute at the last general Assembly, so that this postponement of two months you could go either to defend and present, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"The people of all levels of football, it took a long time ago and is waiting to hear this Thursday at the new President."</seg>
<seg id="80">"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the Association," thinks the man who is associated primarily with the Paris Club Jablonice, but who worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="81">For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that existed in the time of Ivan Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately, in the general Assembly June were adopted statutes that were not as perfect as we thought."</seg>
<seg id="84">"If we exclude certain interpretations, we need a President since September," warned Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I am elected President, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond in the event that it fails."</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a matter of principle, without which we can not exist," said Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Moreover, in theory, tries to stick with their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">Already in the past had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, respect for their training in law, be aware that his opponent would be its first Vice-President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">It took a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with head.</seg>
<seg id="91">"for more than a year in the world of football, and has already achieved some success."</seg>
<seg id="92">"their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"That is why many of them doubt about its true nature," he told his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football competitions, from the lowest to the highest.</seg>
<seg id="95">The latter should be a showcase for the promotion of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose because of Bohemians as the result of the corruption scandal last year."</seg>
<seg id="97">"immediately after I would involve in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," said two months ago to the candidate ČTK 46 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">Below also promised that his appointment as Chairman of the football does not imply any modification of the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="99">"It would have to know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable anxiety.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="100">Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicting before the next general Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday at Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, no doubt we will be able to overcome.</seg>
<seg id="102">"football needs credibility, which will recover only if we finally have a leader," still two days before the day more decisive in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises, under his leadership, the mood Fačr begin to work with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If in the fourth General Assembly elected the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as the new President of the Czech Football Association, a lot of people will probably be resentful.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promised that, if elected, they would work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">It wants to implement a systematic change and do that members of the Executive Committee are responsible for each area of football individually.</seg>
<seg id="107">It also pledges to resolve the case of improving relations with Bohemians, UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue with the work begun by the previous President Ivan Hašek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As President, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football."</seg>
<seg id="109">"Since the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA until the selection via professional football or the training of young footballers of high performance."</seg>
<seg id="110">"that is not to say that it would do everything alone," he said in an interview Rajchl ČTK for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member can engage in a specific area."</seg>
<seg id="112">"and I will give difficult tasks for football can, in each of these segments, proceed with great momentum."</seg>
<seg id="113">"A lot of people that probably would not appreciate this, because they will begin to work very hard and not only to criticise the work of others," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Owing to the atmosphere of criticism in the football Movement, said that he had considered the possibility of not to stand again as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="115">"everyone knows, that work 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"but I need to know that this makes sense and that there will be no people behind me and my dog to prevent every step," explained the reasons for his indecision.</seg>
<seg id="117">"a lot of people told me that I should not give me up, because then they would give up too."</seg>
<seg id="118">"It is important to have faith and not to abandon as well, without more," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">As they say, it motivates also continue the work already started with Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="120">"During those two years, completed a large part of the work that I will not now be lost."</seg>
<seg id="121">"there are processes that had begun and will have its effect within a couple of years and I would not want anyone to stop them," he announced concerned by the fact that, if elected to the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the partnership could return to be as it was before the era of Hašek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.</seg>
<seg id="123">"behind him is especially for all those people who are responsible for football to be just a privilege for a select few."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I can hold a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone."</seg>
<seg id="125">"I try to be objective."</seg>
<seg id="126">"I would like to make a football for all, because only then will feel well all and not just elected," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">It also rejects the idea that only serious Bohemian President.</seg>
<seg id="128">"Although some people try to argue otherwise, I have in mind to do their utmost to Moravia."</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is time to think about the fact of splitting the Second Division in a part in another Czech and Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division."</seg>
<seg id="130">"It would not give the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for young players," said Moravian Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">But at the heart of the presidential elections joined Tomaš Paclík, President of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl continues to believe in their ability to be elected.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I still have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which I chose as his deputy, and you know that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include the savings of some tens of millions of kronor disadvantage of contracts, negotiations of television contracts and negotiations on the Law of the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, it recognizes its part of the blame for the Federation is not united.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">And while proclaiming that "Pelta is disqualified to regain confidence in the Czech football," said another rival, Paclík, a strong candidate that it has something to offer football.</seg>
<seg id="135">"No one can deny that did a great job in the Pilsen that year."</seg>
<seg id="136">"In the case of the election, it will probably be what already started Ivan Hašek currency and not significantly the number of staff in the Committees."</seg>
<seg id="137">"I do not want to use that in my favour," assesses their Rajchl rivals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The most beautiful pools of Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Leap into the blue</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Julia Stanek</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Swimming pools, from a point of incredible, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: who will visit Europe can live their blue marvel, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their legs tired in bathrooms bubbly.</seg>
<seg id="5">A book shows where the best welfare in the water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder conducted a fact-finding trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not fail in their luggage, a swimsuits shown.</seg>
<seg id="7">He lay on his back on the water, watched the artistic dome on top, swimming towards the marble angels, which looked at the edge of the pool and asombraba before the pool deck modernist meticulously restored.</seg>
<seg id="8">He liked the bathroom, noted in his book at the time of all interesting details on the style and the history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and introduced in his recent book "Badefreuden": pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, "concrete construction in Taunus."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">His "journey by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: apart from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">This German 46 years is a real fan of the culture of the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wants nothing to do with sport, Meder said, only water is different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only if it annoys fans in the bathroom have to content themselves with blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or hear trinos blithe of birds in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"one day I wondered why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says this inhabitant of Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I started collecting fine pools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The surface of the water doubles the architecture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The swimming pool chapoteo in the airy and oils in the sauna. The factor of well-being in swimming is so great because it covers all the senses, Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builder strives, swimming decks can be a real gift for the hearing: "instead of soil, in the bathroom is an area of water."</seg>
<seg id="19">"On the one hand is transparent, moreover reflects the beauty of the whole building."</seg>
<seg id="20">All doubles optically: the high vaults, the tiles of colours, the launch pads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The book with photographs in format Badefreuden "small" provides in 190 pages of very interesting data on the architecture and art history in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly, one might be tempted to jump on the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The collector of swimming pools, Meder discovers the copies in its investigations in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths in the bathroom of Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years, waters with nitrates in a unique cavity kárstica (bathrooms in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some items, which are pools of alkaline waters and are in a building with a bottle (in Városi Termálfürdö Jászberény).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular view: while the entire city puts the eyes in the overhead pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, since the swimming pool outside of a bathroom at St. antón, and in the Turkish bath: there is a window from which you can observe the practice in ski runs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The design, perhaps, most extraordinary hopes to customers in Längenfeld: the Cathedral of water in Ötztal ovni just seems a landing in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Three open source steam rises in winter, while substantive mountains of Ötztal stand in the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At Meder, the collector of swimming pools, he invaded the smell of chlorine in all pools.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal baths smell of sulphur in the toilets of Árpád Békescsaba in Hungary, the plague on diesel is so strong that the people are believed to have arrived in a bathroom toilet.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell coming from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose loam is Hits the skin to enter into a swimming pool, a enjoyment of the welfare of a special way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in their pursuit of beautiful places for the bathroom, when they wanted to visit discovered swimming and sunbathing in the bathroom of Czech Luhatschowitz, was found with a blocked field.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bathroom of 1902 of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Meder looked through the windows of the building modernist desmoronadas red, white and yellow, saw the bushes grow between the tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The Decline countered in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Palace Termal in Bad Wildbald.</seg>
<seg id="35">These baths have three phases of construction behind it; not only can you discover neorománicos in times of its construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall style of Alhambra, added in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since its thorough modernisation in 1995, the Palace Termal is the darling of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not just because it is a native of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="37">"There is great merit merging different architectural styles in a fantastic Unit Meder," says.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a palace and immersion in the pool, SPA does not seem to have much importance.</seg>

<seg id="6">In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg,</seg>
<seg id="8">For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculating in agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two-thirds of respondents claimed that Deutsche Bank and other lenders have withdrawn from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest countries in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch is in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the stock exchanges of raw material price increases are global, and the banks saddled with the responsibility of the global problem of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign of the Ombudsman is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar fashion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Originally, bets on raw materials are thought to protect traders of price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The main experts agree that the players have been decoupled from the offers and demands, and reap the profits of the costs of the poorest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ackermann reacted to the criticism in a different way than the American competitors: promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the reputation of Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the report of Foodwatch is.</seg>
<seg id="18">The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then results will be presented to the Board of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the direction of the bank informed of the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann tries to repair its image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch is, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "bets on rising food prices show a particularly dramatic how ruthless banks currently harm the public welfare."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann stands as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The Deutsche Bank should cancel all investments in its portfolio that could jeopardize the money for betting on food prices," said Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">"bothered if Ackermann is the subject of the people who are hungry or the fame of Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving his post.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the Chairman of the Board will change something different is not planned on the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.</seg>
<seg id="29">And It hardly needs to import potential losses, that will address his successor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Two thirds would rescind the investment in raw materials</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch is striving to keep the pressure on the manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the campaign of the Organization.</seg>

<seg id="1">The house in Vienna 21</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The flag moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian exhibition in Brussels in 1958, he won prizes in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now reopened as a House of exhibitions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The architecture of postgerra love modern forms, the clear glass halls curves brave and new construction materials, typical of the thought about technical progress, so that the flag of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the exhibition of 1958 Brussels is a good example and known.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Pavilion Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture for his slight and floating construction of steel and glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is considered to present a milestone of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">The well-known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary tower of four cylinders for MBW over aplanado adjacent building in Munich, became internationally known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its flag, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten alongside the station in the south of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century, was dubbed the "House 20."</seg>
<seg id="12">The building was good but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; no wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite that was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.</seg>
<seg id="14">The building is empty since 2001 and increasingly lapses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the flag, now called "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Tuesday afternoon opened the museum belvedere, who owns the House, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new Director of the gallery belvedere Austrian since 2007, achieved a new beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, Doctorate in art history with a significant career, among other things, patinadora artistic on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum Founder and Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Salzburg, undertook the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the exception of the contemporary art, described the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation of Surrey, there should be a cafe and a bookshop and build an office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict budget under Control</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because amended significantly the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, and expanded it was awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a "huge and important place", which included "almost every weekend" presentations.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reforms have major problems, the building was "an energy devorador Krischanitz," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It changed the profile of the windows on the facade of glass, they installed an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass and replaced the glass ceiling by a special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and the roofs of asbestos was rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light declined between the House and the street lighting, provides a bridge serves to enter the building nearly new, but still the flag of Schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">Stay the original exterior doors, the House is painted in shades of old mahogany and protected against the oxidation.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is exactly as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all this with a strict control on the part of the Office of monuments and a low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"often had to find material that is good, cheap and also liked to the Office of the protection of monuments," says and warns of a soil Krischanitz harsh in the basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, challenges and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.</seg>
<seg id="33">The flag that came from Brussels "has been difficult, recently said Krischanitz, a typical" casual appearance in the history of the city. "</seg>
<seg id="34">An architecture that is "always in the wrong place," and that is why I wanted to "raise awareness".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case the House 21 is not in the wrong place, it was a stroke of luck town-planning. The completely new and planned "neighbourhood of the central Station", with homes and offices, lies alongside the Schweizer Garten.</seg>
<seg id="36">And perhaps succeeds another stroke of luck: the House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary Art Berlin and, as you hear, negotiated with the city on a neighbour in the Schweizer Garten.</seg>

<seg id="6">For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost that were thought to have died some time, since the attacks in the form of fires at Mölln in November 1992 and attack in Solingen in May 1993, had not happened more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, it has never been questioned for Germany to have xenophobia.</seg>
<seg id="8">The right-wing network discovery reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not far from predictable.</seg>

<seg id="13">The coexistence came on the scene with gaudy colours, as a story with a happy ending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," said the title of an article in the Turkish platform internet "Have X", referring to the background of the chain of murder.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Bank riskier of Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now runs a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Sure that Axel Weber had not thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his dramatic departure from the Summit of the federal Bank, in July, it was reported that in a new beginning in 2013 and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the Administrative Council of the great Swiss Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber rejoices publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS by his new-found strength and slipped kind remarks about her future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The USB has achieved a revitalization."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In September, it became clear that everything would be totally different.</seg>
<seg id="11">A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all security systems of the Bank and let down 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Oswald Grübel, general Manager of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Chairman of the Administrative Council of USB was seen since then also touched, and everyone asked: what Comes Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It was reported that Weber must advise the Bank since February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will take over the chairmanship of the Administrative Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the Bank reported on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This is hard to Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker, rather, a Professor of Economics and Director and has had a period of adaptation certainly needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coup is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just returned to prove that deserves the title "the largest bank in the scandal of Europe for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently, was the largest manager of global assets, and on the other hand, for years, is mired in a scandal at the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, will save the once so proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The financial crisis began.</seg>
<seg id="22">The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the Swiss administrator of property, discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on the other hand, advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world's big banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This impressive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent Professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "to my students, I have always called the USB as a model of a good bank."</seg>
<seg id="28">"from today's point of view, one wonders: how I might be wrong?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It was a big mistake.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong in the USB.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general Manager, which until then was regarded as a brilliant banker and very intelligent, resigned unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, it was suspected the reason.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment fund of Bank embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to repay billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">For this, some investors found naturally look with disdain until shortly before: a State fund Asia and opaque of Singapore and an Arab State fund, so discreet, who had never heard his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This was just the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, the Chairman of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second highest-paid Administrative Council of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, continued the catastrophe, in view of their wrong investments, UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State.</seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank bought securities at the UBS by many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which became co-owners of the Bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Throughout Switzerland was affected, it was stated as dramatic as that for a small country, whether houses such large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).</seg>
<seg id="43">"We can not return to rescue the UBS," said Geiger, an expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first catastrophe joined the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over details of wealthy clients, who had possibly disappointed taxes with the help of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, adopts a figure of 780 billions of dollars, reimbursement of undue benefits of these deals with compensation for payment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">With that, the UBS confessed more or less have helped in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="48">Simultaneously lost something that had long been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the glow of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Administrative Council.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of clients funds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">In this way, in a few months, the Bank lost its credibility in its two focal sectors: in the investment banking through the erroneous speculation and the administration of property through the help of fiscal fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when I was back a little calmer, just when it thought that the UBS returned to achieve it, is this wretched history of the operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the Bank realised that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"with the case Adoboli states that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a Professor of Economics and Finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it dominates the controls of risk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">So that the concept of precaution, with the Swiss Bankers were long, being the guardians of the greatest assets of the world: no risk too great, in contrast, the security of the money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine Republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">Security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of the unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli chocolate genuine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The centerpiece of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the strong Swiss private bank, is just a bit higher.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the summits covered in snow in the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">Here the buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Here are jewellery shops like Tiffany `s between traditional business as the Swiss Sprüngli confectionery.</seg>
<seg id="64">Here lie for years the Swiss banks: since the National Bank, via the Palace of Credit Suisse, until the private banks as Julius elitarios Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">It comes in the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside the walls are coated in front of marble, are big leather armchairs, along with the logo of the Bank is a great sign to indicate the "security".</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer seeks here: security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have shifted the idea of the great Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as is the President of a small Swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end of the day, as all Swiss Bankers, also with the business of both big banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS has become too big, believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.</seg>
<seg id="71">There, the Swiss had nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"and they have long accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">In fact, the UBS changed the investment banking Anglo-Saxon, gave his first major gain and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as the great Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.</seg>
<seg id="75">"This Wednesday, the coalition Government of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation," the author writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("the crash of the UBS" in English).</seg>
<seg id="76">Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros to save the large bank of bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">What happens?</seg>
<seg id="78">They spoke with Swiss bankers, and see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge into a powerful consortium.</seg>
<seg id="80">There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the tiny Switzerland, and continues to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">It helped that the two different banks precursors of the UBS complement: a Bank rich but slept with the Center of the administration of property in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the investment banks internationalized arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could make a great financial bicycle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">There are two names associated with the rise of the UBS Peter Wuffli, head of the Consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Administrative Council.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," said the expert in banking Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, intellectual, modest, that means a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to brighten since learning in the Bank until the Summit."</seg>
<seg id="86">Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And in the end Wuffli probably committed a fatal flaw: "thought that their models were a reality," said Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"It is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">It is tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: the blunder came before the event.</seg>
<seg id="91">Employees of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of directors, Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: lower the throne at Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">"The League Tables" topped the rankings, which then documented the success of the banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">The UBS wanted to be at the Summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps you went well.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the currency and in the negotiation of actions was at the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">However, advisers from companies responsible highlighted a weak point: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Growth Ávidos, invested so much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in high-risk American investment.</seg>
<seg id="101">It transformed into a powerful machine to securitise mortgages Americans and sell them below, maintaining certain risks on their own account.</seg>
<seg id="102">And also, as other banks sought the fall for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="103">"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, an expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">So great euphoria, so deep in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager had to go, because the attempt to order was more complicated than expected.</seg>
<seg id="106">The posts in the UBS became proyectables seats and unsafe until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Currently, who heads a large bank, has an almost impossible job.</seg>
<seg id="108">It must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, ending the investment banking, concentrating on the administration of property, returning to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Bank does not go so far (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment banking should decrease much, is now clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new Chairman of the Bank, will present its future strategy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="113">In reality, only thought italiano-suizo in 51 years as a transitional solution, as the Bank, the Bank was separated from his predecessor, surprisingly Grübel.</seg>
<seg id="114">In the meantime, he was imposed, should lead to a permanent business of UBS, reported the Bank in Zurich on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to return to the Investment Bank to its rule in the mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">Removes 3,500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But this is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is this?</seg>
<seg id="120">What wants to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that insurance is currently Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="122">So far only said that first seek shelter with his wife in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The following year.</seg>

<seg id="3">Here are some tips for action: grubbing-up mildly this page and turn the page on its brand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Come to know very well to these people in the narration novelística Mr Englund dramatis personae, and this function as its GPS, a beacon for those few moments when, as one of his men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Mr Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">What he has written here is an unusual book, which describes, rightly, as "a work of Anti-History."</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, "a book about how it happened." talking about "feelings, thoughts, experiences and states of humour."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"The beauty and the pain of the battle" combines the experience in times of war of plus or minus 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanical at escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people will become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members would be crazy or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives here as parpadean votivas lit candles at a church; new ones are added to the mix, while others are going.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book by Mr Englund is a deviation from the standard history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War, was the only fatal trench warfare on the western front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves so expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives; you spend Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is a book touching, almost from the start.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina reeks of cordita.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you're a woman who is at home with your children, or you are huyes?</seg>
<seg id="21">Anyway, what is?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost nobody understands what is happening, even by what it takes to fight this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">"lack of facts," observes Mr Englund, "has been filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German fleet of high seas.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories have been obtained for the most part of memoirs, letters and other material already published previously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but are more alive in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, Mr Englund.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them are about deprivation and cope with what we have.</seg>
<seg id="28">About telling the story of a German schoolchild said: "Substitutes substitutes, everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="29">"ersatz coffee, aluminium false imitation, rubber, paper, bandages buttons of wood."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Still talking about the meal surrogate in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">"meat describes made from rice cooked in fat and squeezing carnero (and topped off with a bone false made of wood; tobacco fact roots and parings of dry potatoes; shoes with soles of wood."</seg>
<seg id="32">There is, he notes, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are about the honour and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American acknowledges its own momentum towards the savagery and said about the war: "you feel that, after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretend that veneer means civilization and that there is not a brute behind pechera almidonada tachonada and that."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Instead of a British soldier realizes that will probably die, and that no one will notice or care.</seg>
<seg id="36">"once you resign themselves to the thought of sacrifice, one would hope that could happen in front of the public," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, it is horribly similar "to a person being strangled in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young century bestiario: the mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with good clothes of clothing that carries his shop while sitting behind a desk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Englund spoke of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading the service at the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"the most bizarre expression of this can be seen trade gonocócico, that we buy embadurnan with soldiers and their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Those who are truly desperate as looking over their eyes, which often leads to blindness for life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to the task.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war "waged exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."</seg>
<seg id="47">People are beginning to ask why their leaders are doing to combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, as The Great War and the memory of modern Paul Fussell, or novels as No novelty in the face of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of comprehensive histories.</seg>
<seg id="49">The volume of Mr Englund joins a Pantheon unconventional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book is one of the most devastating end that I can remember in a work of non-fiction.</seg>
<seg id="51">Do not disclose.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if he had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned with a match.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">After one false step before a planned assault at the minute</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.</seg>
<seg id="3">They chose the night from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.</seg>
<seg id="4">The operation was held in secret, except for a few high-ranking officers, saying initially to others that they were joining an exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre, their presence underscored how the operation was plagaba of challenges for the Police Department.</seg>
<seg id="6">They could not be repeated episodes of recent weeks, as espray of pepper spray on the protesters, breaking the rules of the Department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And that is why the police operation to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park revealed after two weeks of planning and training.</seg>
<seg id="8">The agents had been prepared, seeing as it had developed the occupations in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="9">A mock major catastrophe was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking into Zuccotti.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agents increased the so-called training of disorder - counter-terrorist measures involving swiftly to mobilize large numbers of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The last meeting of training was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.</seg>
<seg id="12">The orders to enter the park arrived at the last minute, "said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the Mission only as" an exercise ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"The few polis that I know that they were called for this, I told them that it was to enter the park Zuccotti," said the person, who spoke anonymously.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The only people who knew that they were going to enter the park Zuccotti were at the highest levels of the Department."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">One reason for the secrecy was a lesson for the city.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 14 October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged ahead of time after hearing about the plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The operation of the Tuesday involved officers from several police units, including special forces throughout the borough - dozens of mobile operators routinely used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Mr Kelly said that many people, including those who commute to work, had been going up and coming to the park during the day, making the 1 p.m. a good time to go.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It was appropriate to do so when the fewest number of people in the park," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with pockets and loudspeakers congregated at the junction of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before exiting.</seg>
<seg id="21">The lights and the pre-recorded messages that retumbaban from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="22">The agents of community affairs were at the park with his clear blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up his things and left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Do not touch any shop until the, Broj 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time for the protesters to collect their belongings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that it was for their safety.</seg>
<seg id="27">But many journalists said they tried to avoid coming to the police to take action in the park, and that they had been treated rudely by agents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Browne said that the mobile television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, they were able to capture images.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As the police moved westward through the dense thicket of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and bags of garbage, paper and plastic packed with clothes, teams of the Department of Cleaning followed them, picking up what was left behind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Some protesters who refused to move were dragged away, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="31">A core group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the centre of the park.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp candaron between them by the arms.</seg>
<seg id="34">And two people were chained to trees, said Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="35">The agents of the emergency service were called to cut the locks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 more or less a. m., said Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="37">The road-clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Mr Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.</seg>
<seg id="39">Most of the arrests were for "disturbing the public order and resistance to authority," he said.</seg>
<seg id="40">The most senior officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the Department, the senior uniformed Officer in the Department.</seg>
<seg id="41">Phil T. Pulaski, the Chief of detectives of the Department, was also there.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Kelly, while he was present, "he was not running the operations," said Mr Browne.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">A second group of players expected along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There were barricades in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block to the South.</seg>
<seg id="45">Since these positions, he was at the police to expand beyond the perimeter of the Park Zuccotti.</seg>
<seg id="46">At one point, a number of players, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="47">There were some 28 people in the northern perimeter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Some of the most vocal of the night took place in the south of the park.</seg>
<seg id="49">Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air of the wheels of a police van.</seg>
<seg id="50">At one point, a piece of plywood went flying from the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the end, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Union of support workers sued the City by redundancies</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Union, which represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The demand is, perhaps, the ultimate weapon at the disposal of the Union, the borough 37, in their effort to repeal the redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost its work on 7 October, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for his refusal to allow, last spring, access on the part of the city at a depth of healthcare by working groups to close its budget gap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing at the City Council last month, the Director of Education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the Council RUF retaliated by saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the support staff of the school would be dismissed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Officials of the borough 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning to the Department of Education that would be sued. Be held a press conference Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the claim, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Education Department of the city as defendants, and has eight redundant workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Hispanic women, like the majority of people who lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been inadequately subsidised of chronic form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It said that while there was no redundancies in Staten Island and a few redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit said, "this is not a wealthy suburb of parents to raise funds to cover the budget deficit."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P.D. The budget of the district 36 fell 3.26% this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrolment for poor schools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Union also argues that the directors of secondary schools may have been misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, despite the fact that "surplus" describes more often the act of removing a master of the payroll of a school with a bag of work, whose salaries are paid by the central Office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"sixty six coordinators of parents were dismissed," says the draft of the complaint, "and not only in surplus."</seg>

<seg id="1">Closed mission, the Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Finally seems to Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="3">All that was required was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the participation of the United States came to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate will consider a resolution, sponsored by the Chairman John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, along with Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is to honour the brave people of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may seem harmless, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, lawmakers from both parties fought among themselves and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution that authorizes the limited use of US military forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and that never came to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut the funding for U.S. operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">That left the mission of US in a kind of purgatory legislature - with Congress sufficiently embarrassed to criticize Obama's handling of the Mission, but not as angry as to actually take the grass beneath their feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Then, the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO Mission officially ended on 31 October.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now the Senate could be ready to act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for its tremendous courage and remarkable resilience to free themselves" and "commends the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners are engaged in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary bravery and professionalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition towards democracy in Libya."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new measure would win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divided lawmakers as the bill in June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the top Republican on the Committee.</seg>
<seg id="21">The spokesman of Venue said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the bill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually achieves a vote by the entire Assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other lawmakers have failed so far to bring their amendments to the Assembly, but not for lack of trying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Of Goodlatte is the only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are duplicates - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budgetary balance just in the House, and another handful that "control federal spending."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of these bills are also identical between themselves, but they give their sponsors - mostly Republicans novice seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were "authors" of the measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate vote an amendment of the budgetary balance.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while the Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of New York, wants to remove the two-term limit for Presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as banning flag-burning.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So enthusiasts who have been members to propose amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Congress, lawmakers proposed 111º 77 amendments, and made 66 at 110th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The pace is unacceptable in comparison with that of the 1990s, when members regularly featured more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But they did not have much more successful then than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="39">The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.</seg>

<seg id="1">"beaten but not defeated," Giffords spoke in his first interview since the shooting on TV</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ten months after a gunman fired him at close range at a constituent event in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona appeared on national television Monday night, sang accompanied by the melody of Broadway, "the sun will come out tomorrow," and said that he wanted to recover more of what I wanted to return to Congress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In his appearance on ABC News "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The programme documented their difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that shattered the skull and drilled the left side of her brain, and that step from the front to the back of his head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Three months ago, again by surprise to the House to vote triumphant in the agreement of the debt ceiling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, and sang River - and described her recovery as "difficult".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">When Sawyer asked how she felt, Giffords, 41, responded: "quite well".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program "20/20" of one hour, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book, "the pair Gabby: a story of courage and hope."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.</seg>
<seg id="10">In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, you see it in his hospital bed, his head shave and a long scar across his face.</seg>
<seg id="11">It can only have one or two fingers, while her husband erguidos behind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Months later, sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists taught him how to perform simple actions.</seg>
<seg id="13">A movement of the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">One of fruncimiento lips.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then, her first word: "what".</seg>
<seg id="16">In a few days, Giffords delivered another word - "tostada", a request for a change in its breakfast menu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Footage broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: sees the Congressman singing along with therapists songs, "Ms. Girls Just Have Fund" and Cyndi Lauper's "Free Falling" of Tom Petty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours of therapy every day, he said that he did not recall the day of the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="19">Her husband said that he was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the killing of 12 March when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.</seg>
<seg id="20">The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held at a Missouri prison and is being medication by force while awaiting trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Many people died," he said Giffords to Sawyer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"tough, tough, tough."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of the recovery of his wife, she said: "I have been defeated."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"So, I told him, `Gabby, it has not been defeated," said Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Just has been hit.</seg>
<seg id="26">And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to catch you and you're going to come back stronger than ever. "</seg>

<seg id="8">"The show as a kind of orphaned children," the Officer wrote in an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.</seg>
<seg id="10">It took.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it was not respect, really. It was regrettable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The contradictory impressions starkly illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an American public often distant, sometimes adorador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It extends to the troops with praise for their sacrifices.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the praise has a price, told members of the service.</seg>
<seg id="15">The public increasingly acts as if given penalty those in uniform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We are not suffering at all," said Brigadier-General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon head to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"But it seems that the only way that some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of souls helpless."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The issue is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to sound ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.</seg>
<seg id="19">They also realize that the ira faced troops who returned in recent years of the Vietnam War was much worse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a result, the majority of the talks on the pity was conducted in silence and in private between war veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">After his two sons returned to fight with the Marine Corps, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Some regard them with a sense of fear that clashed with insurgents and travelled to exotic locations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Others will wonder whether there would be a "veteran angry and violent beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of government in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">During their job search, he said, felt that some interviewers subtly had asked him whether he would be able to stand up under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"When you talk about your service, you need to address the negative perceptions," recalled Cancian telling it to their children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The military concern stems, in part, of the American indifference towards the wars.</seg>
<seg id="27">The gains on the battlefield are rarely elected to the praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"We, as a nation, we do not appreciate the military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant general David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In contrast, the praise of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.</seg>
<seg id="30">The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The army faces growing pressure to end the violation</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 men and women with a case against the army for its alleged passivity in the face of the violation.</seg>
<seg id="3">If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are planning for the next one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The soldier from 1st Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she said she was raped by a fellow student.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was October 2008, and went back to their headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met with a colleague who was wearing a package of 12 cans of beer.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked if he could join her in her room to take a drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">"sounded an alarm signal," said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the native Texas left aside his concern.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought, no, has 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is in Texas," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I had listened to my instincts."</seg>
<seg id="12">Within minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, throwing down and violating the claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel anxiously await a court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand is filed against former Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go on trial.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the widespread violation between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., demand implied initially to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke said that going to the leadership of the army, because the problem starts with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The army is a top-down structure," he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? the high command."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also said that since February, have been in contact with nearly 400 survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands.</seg>
<seg id="20">His strategy: instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present a number of cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by the federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed defence strategy - in essence, that the military can not be sued for current or former soldiers from injuries sustained in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">By a Judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal Government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the damage alleged is part of the military service of the plaintiffs," say the documents.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Defense Department declined to comment for this article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whereas women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear lines of the front.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time that the army will also be modernized, Burke said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She is not alone in their struggle, and three other demands are in progress, in addition to the machine.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Yale Law Clinic for Veterans Legal Services is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting an environment misogynistic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" allocated to victims of rape in order to give them the high service - a common occurrence, according to activists like Association Bhagwati Action Network of Women in Service, a human rights group.</seg>
<seg id="34">His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing the discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">They have submitted nine separate bills in Congress by a mixture of bipartisan senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and the response of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, that figure in approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred this year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report, published in March, also examines the indices of processing: in 2010, 20% of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that in the civil justice system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described the attacks as just the first of a series of trauma.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged violation of the military police in less than an hour after it had happened.</seg>
<seg id="41">That night, he said, was asked to have the details of its violation 11 different times in a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker - a cut on his arm - was found in his bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having had sexual intercourse with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people declared as witnesses of personality in the name of the suspect, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day when the verdict was read," said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought that I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."</seg>
<seg id="47">"I was placed in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember that I said to my commanding officer," that was not his view. That was my opinion. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">At Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, which eventually diagnosed with a personality disorder, which did not fit for the service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010 was discharged from the service under menos-que-honorables terms, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, said John Turley, Professor of Law at the Faculty of Law George Washington.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, he said, "In my opinion, should be able to move forward."</seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.</seg>
<seg id="53">I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is decades behind because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence of responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He added: "the chances are strongly against them... but it is important for them to try."</seg>
<seg id="56">These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the audience is not on its way, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, made the tail in their hundreds of other applicants for future cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We are going to continue to fight against the army in this item until the reform will take place," he said.</seg>
<seg id="59">"or until we killed, whichever occurs first.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: How to Get researchers are studying in Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another kind that aireaba its anti-immigration views online.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having made a massacre in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of the time leading up to the attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how can you find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy - but you have to go on Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We realised that it was not so difficult to reach them," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on the European digital populism by the British think-tank DEMOS.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cache of personal information on Facebook is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett said, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that sellers have been using for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team of Bartlett found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then you went announcements, but instead of linking them to a new band or product of diet, advertisements inviting users to complete a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the room.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a whole new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not entirely surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, in a kind of turnaround, "those who combine their activism in line with the offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems for social trends as expressed in the "likes" messages on the walls and updates of State.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three pieces of content a day, "supernova" of Facebook is fueling a boom of the investigation, boosting the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title until nearly 800% in the past five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it enables you to study the people that you could not bring yourself with a folder on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"before, when intentabas to survey people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You should go through the party, and they would never get access," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook removes all of that - you're going to them directly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the problems of salud-social.</seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, found that college students who spoke of their exploits of binge drinking on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drink that students who remained silent on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suggested that fellow students, such as residential advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of State with its binge drinking.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can not treat a problem if you can not diagnose," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of the Child in the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook is also constantly "pinchando" to his own people to obtain data.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Team Data site has produced statistics on the status of the relationship and the Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness index (mainly using information that can be accessed - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should be available to other large amounts of data for research).</seg>
<seg id="29">However, users of Facebook know that the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice on the power play Scrabble with a friend to the thousands of kilometres away is to allow the site to undermine your personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what happens when users of Facebook become part of a survey that even know?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect their data offline and online is a free lunch for all.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not think that many users have thought even in the fact that an investigator could be reviewing their profiles," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a 2006 study carried out with the walls of public Facebook students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"as far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic this being completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information in the profile of a user and the messages of the wall are true.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a pen sujetapapeles and remain the best research tools that anyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"There is No substitute for entry into the real world and talk to real people," he said.</seg>
<seg id="40">"social research is supposed to be on social terms - and a lot of the social still happening offline."</seg>

<seg id="1">"cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik made his first public appearance in court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter for the "resistance" during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway," said before a room packed with 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I am opposed to the Court, which received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I acknowledge the facts but I plead guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their points of view."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written statement beforehand, to contact the families of their victims at the end of the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, denied access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some came with the hope of Breivik look in the eyes, other to confirm that it is kept under lock and key.</seg>
<seg id="11">All attended with the goal of moving towards the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," said one survivor of Utoya to ​ ​ Norwegian broadcaster NRK.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked at journalists and survivors in the eye when they entered and left the building.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik of being part of a movement of "resistance", the judge ruled that it is not a mental illness, and said that there was no evidence that he acted with co-conspirators.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is possible that some are comforted that attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist in place of a radical group.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that does not automatically eased the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I wish that it seems a monster, but we do not think so," said a family member of a victim.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would be much easier if it seems."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">7 lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, is shown in a theater this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of the technology as the Great Inventor Moderne.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what the fans of Apple could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs Rediscovered recently has been dusted in advance of a series of special screenings in the major markets this week, is how much understood this creative minds about business processes and workflows of products.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but it was also an organizer of a meticulous and yonki flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives were "a disease that is to think that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Nerds (The Triumph of the triumph of the idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for an extended and rare conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time had passed barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and we worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the adoption of a popular Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of the interview Cringely was used in Nerds, said that the original interview disappeared during transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was only after the death of Jobs discovered a complete copy on VHS in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This archival material, slightly reprinted, is the basis of Steve Jobs: the Lost Interview, 68 minutes, at Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And very muses.</seg>
<seg id="12">In four different locations throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is clearly weighing their thoughts, seeking clarification.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when the perfection of Jobs goes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to questions of Cringely, pushing him to go faster towards the items or arguments of utmost importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic interview in The Lost, when Jobs assesses what it sees that other companies do good and evil, and offers its own vision of the future of computing.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to read posthumous assessments of the career of Jobs, but there is something crude and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the dreamer poised on the brink of greatness.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things can and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Not long after explaining everything in detail here, and it was made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of seven remarkable footage of The Lost interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">On how he learned to carry a business:</seg>
<seg id="20">"Over the years in the business, I always asked:" Why do things? "and the answers that you give an unchanged:" Oh, that is just the way it goes. "</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify the accounts of Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffled by the way with the costs - often starting with a "standard cost" on rough estimates, and then was consistent with a "variable" - developed an automated factory which ensured that could determine business costs in detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On the joke with the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">"Jobs narrates the Blue Box" which he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allows people to effectively hackear telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.</seg>
<seg id="27">It has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">Describes how he and Wozniak proved the box through the use of a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from a network of AT & T, while creating a loop with the greatest number of satellites as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and gritabas through the public telephone and again a minute later to the public telephone of the door," says Jobs with risita one.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and I learned was that we could build something ourselves that we could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">Both of us, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was a lesson incredible, and I do not think that Apple would never have existed without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost dropped out, calling on the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, as did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">As several Members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk with the American diplomat, the two erupted in laughter just before the very Pope was excited to go to answer the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On falls in love of technology (and telemarketing with Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years, the hunting of spare parts to build an accountant of frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and made him a call.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard part-time.</seg>
<seg id="37">"that was a significant influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they treat their employees."</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the employees of HP who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first computer of panel has ever done."</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen of cathode tube, and I enamoré.</seg>
<seg id="40">Get a trip to HP as a teenager and lost time with that machine and write programs for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">About improvising innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">At several points in the interview, Jobs spoke about inventing new products on the march.</seg>
<seg id="43">Early in his career, which was devoted to sell a handful of base plates, a customer asked if it could put the whole team.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working with just 30 days of credit, had to find out the Assembly and delivery of finished devices.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, while in Apple, recalls the struggles faced in the development of a computer mouse.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember having dramatic arguments... I shouted that it would take five years to create a mouse that cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer.</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build by 15 million and that it was completely reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On the big companies losing strength:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before he heads the rebirth of Apple, Jobs presciently foresaw the way in which many industry leaders encountered in his vision, and lose control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">"say that you have worked at IBM or Xerox, copiers and printers do better, and what?"</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company has no more successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">The departments of sales and marketing increase the success, so they are the kind of people who run companies and individuals responsible for the products were expelled from the forum for decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position rots because people do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the craft necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas cenan with rivals in the law of healthcare while the court accepts the case</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue politically controversial whether to accept the challenge to the healthcare law President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers to set out the case before the High Court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 States challenging the total reform of healthcare passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry for conservative activists across the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed to admit the demand and, in fact, is expected to be a landmark case of 5 1/2 hours in March, and the result is likely to further muddy the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the decision of the Court is known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer to appear before the Court and argued that the law should be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney general during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has for many years devoted to the defence of the conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another firm sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the Court on the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican in the Senate and an opponent of the health care law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it is not something that comes into conflict with the ethical standards.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If it were, it could be argued that fall under the Code of Canon 4C, which reads: "A judge can attend events to raise money for organizations connected with the law and other, although the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appear on the agenda of this event."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the proximity of Scalia and Thomas absolute two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of Ethics in Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the Code goes against the demands of several judges to comply with the Court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Causa Común).</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges were agasajados at a fund-raising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the Court."</seg>
<seg id="20">His appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest by critics who say that mixes too easily the activity of the Court with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Moreover, the Conservatives argue that is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan served as Solicitor general for the Obama administration when it filed the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance.</seg>
<seg id="25">His critics have pressed for Kagan refrain of the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan has not given any indication that it will do.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.</seg>

<seg id="16">Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the planes, but that an increase in fuel prices - usually bad for airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">The request of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing in the market of wide-bodied aircraft and helps to keep at bay the attempt of his rival Airbus SAS to invade their dominance with the A350 airliner.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the election of the violent State, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of his opponents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for Governor of the Western state of Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"The involvement of organised crime throughout the electoral process, and particularly yesterday, is alarming, not only in Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the vote on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">"They threatened to our candidates, our electoral workers... seized the polls, erected barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favour of the IRS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, it was the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.</seg>
<seg id="9">The IRS is hoping to win the presidential election in July.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Vallejo seems to have overtaken by little room for Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.</seg>
<seg id="11">Calderon, a candidate for the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, his brother refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of Governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the left divided and unhappy before the 2012 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the home State of President Felipe Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">ADB urges Asia to help rescue the Eurozone</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare for helping to rescue the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term to prevent the growth of the Asian economies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat Nag, general Manager of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two great fastest-growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">He warned against the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries adhering to the difficulties of Europe in a "fair" and said that the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and European resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are all in this together."</seg>
<seg id="6">"So anyone who can help Europe to emerge from the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can not be immune."</seg>
<seg id="8">"So if China and India can help, by all means."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that he might push the global economy into recession and has led to calls for major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone to find a solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Anand Sharma, India's Commerce Minister, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone since its own economy was now suffering the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"No one wants the eurozone remains volatile and turbulent," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We have a monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility in helping rich Europeans when faced with their own and deep economic problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million people live with nearly $2 a day or less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"at some point you will realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on holiday at the beach and that will not be good," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Lee Howell, Managing director of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India's reservation should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid workers of the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-making as railways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to "significant knock-on effects" across Asia.</seg>
<seg id="22">The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces the "low risk" because of the threat of Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts looming could undermine national security and provoke a reaction in the financial chain from the corridors of the Pentagon, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, the Assembly line civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that could be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Department," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "abduction", would give rise to a 23 percent of overall reductions and a great many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"a cut of this large, applied indiscriminately, would make the bulk of our projects and naval construction could not be carried out - you can not buy three quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta Senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We will also be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the objective."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the willingness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts in time would amount to combat troops, Panetta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"While the financing for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations are not directly affected by the abduction, the efforts of the war would be negatively affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis," warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in the contracts and oversight of the contract to support the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to vendors in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The result of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline in the United States as a major military Power in the world."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are firmly against this draconian Action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they issued the letter to Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is not an outcome that can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the abduction is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to happen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensified calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, despite reaching a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that it faced difficult decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In a press conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a squad without bullets."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is an air wing without sufficient pilots trained."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep abreast with potential adversaries."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In effect, invites aggression..."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay at the time in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could face the axe, including those who are already testing and some only in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">That list includes the warplane F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned ballistic submarine, the new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new combat vehicle on land that the Army and Navy humvee, need replacing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Halting the development and additional evidence of F35 the could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="4">The managers of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assault children.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="5">Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with a microphone saying to the US President, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Congressman from New York and exhibicionista on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with its denials quickly objections by the irrefutable evidence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of wrongdoing in the financing of the campaign for the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, again, no one living will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton for lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Are widespread legends on the traps in reviews of school and university.</seg>
<seg id="11">There have been cases in which teachers have given the responses of exams to students in order to be better seen in their assessments of performance.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mentor should be taught to the contrary are sending the message that lie and cheat are acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much deception us?</seg>
<seg id="14">In a single day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.</seg>
<seg id="15">That sure, many of these lies are white lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that the strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill to acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the aim is to say: "You have," the detection of deception is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies have been objections.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Liars look them in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="21">Not always, tartamudean balbucean, ruborizan or disturbed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It can not be concluded that the liars are difficult to detect or expose.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lie detector can be trained to learn the truth about the structure of the statement, microfaciales expressions, the formation of questions and the times.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries on deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include the recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liars have the ability to read properly to others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and feeling intuitively how perceived by others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know from research that the introverted extrovertidos lie beyond the men say more oriented towards themselves "lies", while women say more lies "geared towards others" -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners that persons who are not married, but the lies that usually say tend to be "huge").</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How to know if someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, the usual behaviour of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's called "creating a baseline."</seg>
<seg id="31">Aid to provide benchmarks to measure after the changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The position of the subject, laugh and vocal feature.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is better to know if someone golpetea normally with the foot around the time for not doing unfair charges when you see golpeteando feet in the middle of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Next, find groups of deceptive behavior, verbal and non-verbal.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as evidence of deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Those who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember their history, can enroll their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change its stance significantly or display a "relaxation postentrevista" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Often the interrogators falsely imply that the interview had completed only to seek postentrevista relief.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">It also draws attention to the vocabulary of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">Scott Peterson got the LEG until the Fund and used the past while he claimed that his wife murdered was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Those who cheat can also use a polarizing language: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky..." or repeat a difficult question in full.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal indicators are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Anyone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when replying to a difficult question: "well... to tell the truth... until I was... in my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="43">This makes the answer is a perception rather than a fact, and it is often a warning sign.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to detect deception is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">TransCanada said on Monday night to move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive areas of Nebraska Sandhills in, and hoped that the project won approval.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="5">The managers of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, said that the company remained confident that over time the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permit for the project to study new potential routes that avoid the areas of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a massive underground water supply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"This is a real way forward," said Representative Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, Fox News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new environmental review ordered by the State Department, it is possible that apart from any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and they expressed their full support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The pipeline would stretch 1,700 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="11">Would carry 700,000 barrels per day of the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">This would require that across six States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is hated by environmentalists, but beloved by the working groups, which have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But lawmakers in Nebraska opposing the plan are weighing legislation to force a retreat from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The environmental impact study of the current State Department found that the project raised only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the inspector general of the Department has ordered an independent evidence of the review process, focusing on two issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, representing a conflict of interest for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other is whether a firm that was contracted to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.</seg>

<seg id="1">Climate Adversidad slowed the economy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, dropped foreign investment and the economy shrank</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, calling for change, which generated high expectations for progress on the economy, but given the adversity of climate for the start of the year, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.</seg>
<seg id="4">The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing billions in losses for the agricultural sector, limited the scope of the State's economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic collapse of 31.16% in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the report of the impact of frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development took damage in $582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which the total damage suffered 78.03 percent and the remaining 2107 percent had partial damage, the main victims were the crops of vegetables, corn and garbanzo.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="9">"What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for purposes of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed in the Congress to combat money laundering, already for the people that grab dollars illegally is not easy to work, invest and use them in something," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Migration arrested</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Lopez Cervantes noted that the increase in unemployment, there is also a factor in population.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The number of people who are going to the State in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties for entry, and second because entering already have too many difficulties in finding work, that people are falling and is demanding jobs here in the State, which means that unemployment will rise," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Informalidad</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The analysis of the labour market sinaloense is compounded by considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the working population in the State works without being listed as a worker before any institution of social security.</seg>
<seg id="15">Coupled with unemployment and informality, another labour lags in the State are low wages, the company has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.</seg>
<seg id="16">The average monthly income of sinaloenses workers was, until September, 5 000 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 000 375 pesos.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The switch from analog to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree that the so-called "analogue switch-off" from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes needed to overturn it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that the President Felipe Calderón is not overstepped its authority to issue the Decree detailing the actions to effect the transition to digital terrestrial television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court ruled on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The draft judgment prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, owing to the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a reserved power by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchy and subordination of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In favour of the draft voted only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the very Sánchez Cordero.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and to admit the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions as he prepared for the digital transition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The full Ministers also decided to dismiss the application filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without going to the discussion of the draft, also in charge of the Minister Sánchez Cordero.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In his speech, the President said Minister does not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive can not structure through general rules measures to ensure that the public service is prepared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Nor do I think that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the Rector of the State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The switch from analog to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Postponing the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system, according to the principle of economic stewardship of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."</seg>

<seg id="3">The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality in regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán where, according to data released by the Programme of Preliminary Election Results (COUNT) the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial race is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 6 000 74 minutes total.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this regard, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán, Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, barely on 9 November, the electoral Body adopted a set of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It will be recalled, Michoacán not accredited its Constitution and the Electoral Code of the State or its Act of Electoral Justice, whenever the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline to enter into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication on schedule in the Official Newspaper Act of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) settled the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the Mandatory state of constitutional reforms, which has no right to "punish or veto."</seg>

<seg id="7">Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal explained that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the General Council of the possible IEM will be partial and total tally of the vote by the local electoral body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In this way, the partial recount of votes in one or more electoral packages, may be on the assumptions that: the results of the records do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and count in the record of the box or not in possession of the President of the same; or, if there are obvious errors or alterations of the records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, the total tally of the vote received in all cells of the election may occur when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumptive winner of the election in question and which has won the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; if at the beginning of the sitting there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that applied for the second candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The total tally of the vote may also be conducted if at the end of the regular count establishes that the difference between the candidate and the winner allegedly located in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, if and when there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second, in which case it shall exclude the electoral packages that have been the subject of a partial recount.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where, according to the SOURCES of the difference between the first and second place is only with 0.16 percent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.</seg>

<seg id="1">On Wednesday, he will form the new Italian government</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce the new Government will face a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to introduce the new Government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a Government.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected to present a Cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when it will assume the post on new executive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said that the President will present the outcome of its talks with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I would like to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti did not say explicitly that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"The context is now staccato-like," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy combat, a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the volatility of the markets posted the bond yields on 10-year Italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, the Italian employers told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot to this government."</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy out of this emergency situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success of Monti were boosted considerably by the backing of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result," he told the press Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre-right party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, it is significant because, until now, many of its members had opposed the Government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new Government of Monti should have a strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.</seg>
<seg id="20">Any blockage or delay in their efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began on Monday, its consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth organizations and women.</seg>
<seg id="23">It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has made an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti has said that his Government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on which politicians just give it time to implement reforms before early elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it must be formed only by technicians, a sign of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources indicated that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So assured the rally and Co-Founder, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Group is on the wing suramericana of his tour of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its single scale in Central America.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This is an excerpt of the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To his supporters, Costa Rica is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will touch in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are experiencing their fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is only the second time in South and Central America and has so far been grand.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have been in Costa Rica just once, and holiday; it is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there.</seg>
<seg id="13">So we are excited to bring our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensity in the preceding days.</seg>
<seg id="15">What do you say to its most ardent fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you for staying with us through all these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people even as regards his concert as the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Does he adds that a bit of pressure on his visit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the biggest shows that we have fallen over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We touch a pair of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have put into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">In truth, we are very eager to play there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How was it discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have a lot of friends who are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends are always going to be surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places for surfing; this was how we learn, by means of people who love the pool.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">To see the tour, have been delivering shows enormous with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What they have planned for his presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As we have never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what they can do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to give the best possible show with a good range of songs; try to touch on a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat the Repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why is this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think it is partly because we have nine discs and can touch more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the repertoire they carry while not to touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of why we liked these songs and that we were able to have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">That makes the show more interesting for us, and I therefore believe that it becomes more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of history.</seg>
<seg id="37">Looking back, it is hard to believe everything we have achieved?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">Firstly, I think that none of us imagine that we would be in a large rock band and have done so for more than 20 years ago that seems like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.</seg>
<seg id="41">We all want and we love to create music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are fortunate to go to places of the world who always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What you meant to have been a key part of the emergence of grunge the?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It has always been an honour to be part of that group of big bands.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when a movement stems from a group of friends and is something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="48">Occasionally, a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time in the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We are proud and honoured to be part of the Group of Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Yet we touch with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in his tour, so that we are fortunate to be friends of all of them yet and we are honoured to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very strange that a band like you would stand united and with the same members for so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us we have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than the duration of many bands.</seg>
<seg id="54">Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and, secondly, we all care about each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all very close friends and, because of that, they have also opened musical avenues that give him freedom to each experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">We trust each other with the music of each one and could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The relationship you have with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How are stock?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.</seg>
<seg id="60">We make sure that we will not be too tour because it is easy to fall into this game of the large crowds and the people who love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">While one remembers that the people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought, without infatuated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How recalls another project Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think we write very good songs and the principle was a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were a band for almost three years and never published a disk until after the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">There were many frustrations because both duration and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how to make me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an amazing man and I miss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The band Robertas national The will open the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that therefore the chosen for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production we sent videos with several proposals, and that was the band that we liked, so we are eager to see what The Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why is always changing the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings the and I think the first thing that happens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">As a rally, what are their influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">There are so many.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the first that spring to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many who could talk all afternoon on falling that I love.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How Pearl Jam has managed to maintain the relevance grunge despite not being as a fad?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think that all of us always feel somewhat disconnected from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think about it, I am reminded of the bands that I mentioned earlier, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden Nirvana, and all that emerged at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it is a wonderful thing because it is worth listening to music and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the beginning, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">Why is this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is interesting because I believe that there are a couple of songs on the new album which may appear leaner, but there are also songs such as The End or Just Breathe songs that qualify as very dark but may sound a little positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard and are deeply obscure songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I believe that if there is any more trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and those two songs undoubtedly represent that for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also, I think that it can be a happy person and still able to make music that is dark.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The 12 occupants left the farm midday yesterday without offering resistance</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that living the neighbours of the 51 street Balmes has come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twelve people left midday yesterday voluntarily illegally occupied the building, and they organized macrofiestas that desesperaban in the neighborhood, by court order and without the need of a police intervention.</seg>

<seg id="1">Do park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects agree on the timing of the announcement beyond polemics on fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Amediados of 80, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration gave few tracts of promotion of Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park New Yorker.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park will again be in the fable of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that are not aimed at the North-South axis but mountain top (bottom) - (Sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The rating of Collserola as natural park is in this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone jabalís, with the role of the bear Yogi.</seg>
<seg id="10">In these was until, in September, the Council megacompetición convened a composed of 16 competitions for many other gateways for Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door refers to the idea of Park, without doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">Or that someone wants to put doors to the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question goes alone: Park Collserola, or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The contest, both for its purely organisational side and by what means of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among barceloneses all architects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost as a recurring theme to fall back on when two Members of this ancient caste of elected were recognized in an elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this is just one of the few matches between the opinion barceloneses three architects, and university professors, which have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán, after addressing the front coastline "is necessary to" discuss "the front of mountain", given that the speech by Ildefons Cerdà, green apples, has not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It should be based on the most extensive fleet of Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things for his great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Collserola is more complex, the architect for the title of" Gates "Collserola holds a" trap "léxica: we must not think of them" as the entrance to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where we need to act. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Roldan and Bayonne Mòdol, as experienced in the urban world, called the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"dangers arising from the" uncertain that today is projecting the public space "after the experience in the 1980s, and that was in the area of the" Fòrum his swan song. "</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the very definition of borders on where it can be built.</seg>
<seg id="25">"limit is set as the next step," i.e., they exceed.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We need to think in new instruments, urban planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan PGM (CPA)] can lead to real disasters."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">More matter-of-fact question, Mòdol believes that simplifying the strand vallesana of Collserola "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not", by a mere topography.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the reality of Collserola "should not fall on deaf ears," but appreciates the opportunity that the City offers his body to intervene in this project, "from the first moment."</seg>
<seg id="29">And even more, understands that the proximity of the mountains in the city is the laissez-passer that enables architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile which must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success story," said) that have had to be created: "The architects should be just a tool."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives way to this piece is complex, because in the foundation of the contest lack a global vision of Collserola: "16 contests have been convened cross-cutting - said - in the sense montaña-mar, but there is no longitudinal reading, to see and understand the entire area."</seg>
<seg id="31">This leads, at least in his case, which has chosen to participate in 16 contests.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in programme and with the definition of the architect of the next door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his view, however, the Council should ensure that the Strip immediately above the Round of FALD should provide throughout an area of equipment to make a smooth transition between the City and the Green.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the signals it sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the Mexico Valley metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry FQ (UNAM), who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is apt, potholes could be reduced in number, or even eliminate it altogether.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his Conference a technological view of potholes, made in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory at his office asfaltos develops modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater strength, both high and low temperatures.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera felt that this type of asfaltos modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance, and therefore the formation of potholes.</seg>

<seg id="7">The behaviour viscoelástico asphalt is that high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees Celsius presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that in the streets, the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but that will change during the day in accordance with environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The investigator FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of material, of which the last three involve the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt, composed of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each kit, piedritas constitutes said, is awash with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transit vehicles and generate efforts, it allows the forces are spread very well on the pavement.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it were modified asphalt is disseminated even better, said the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the asphalt, enough, it puts a final layer of rolling so-called kit, which is made of a material of stone, i.e., a fine sand also washes in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As it is the layer that is going to be in contact with the tyres of cars, should have more mechanical force that the asphalt and provide friction in the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">As part of the carriageway is going to receive and impart efforts, the kit rolling requires also have the right thickness and care must be the material from which it is made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the ground Wets, water is spreading in the interior of the kit and it is difficult to leave, it causes a thaw in all strata of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the process of forming a pothole, he said, is the first to wear the film tread and only then affects the asphalt, but the damage does not happen overnight, but it is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is also a member of the National Research System explained that the vehicular burden is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer on the pavement should always be in connection with the vehicular burden and to ensure compliance, to prevent the formation of potholes frequently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt emulsions, for example, the TAR, that other countries are already including in the market and to repair potholes with ease and without using high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">What is missing from the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna did not achieve the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Valle receives its title number 14 Princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the appetite of the Crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of winners, wearing the crown of silver and the gang credited as the new princess of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the Crown and sceptre, the Department has risen to 14 degrees of Princess and Melina was one of the Legion of vallecaucanas women who have been near the Crown but were proclamations Princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Today, the big question is how many are missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite with each submission showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected as Queen of the Police and Better Face Jolie of Vogue, titles won queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first is considered a key factor in the decision of the jury to appoint the First Princess is not impressed with his answer to the question, "What is this book that you set for yourself and why made by Martin Murillo Gómez, the Literary Carreta Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">interrrogante vallecaucana responded to the:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think quite in literature, I believe that it is a form of culturalizarse definitely think that the book that I set of childhood principito" is ", the book is quite profound.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now I read "Crime and Punishment," is a book of world literature that everyone should read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called "the ardor of blood".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A response that little liked first by the term "culturalizarse" and second for failing to explain specifically how each of the books that cited the mark.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result, "the universe is wise is what needs to happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all the people, please read a little bit, "the" principito is a great book. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among the assumptions made says that the burned Valley favouritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist bogotano hinted that to be the preferred candidate ovacionada, and that was all preliminary awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote for the best artisanal clothes, and Queen Mother), "that sparked jealousy of the other candidates, estresó Queen and therefore not shone in the scene."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And that was reflected in his first appearance in a bathing costume on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although lució in both safe, it showed that he lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic, it showed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "at home", the Channel RCN felt that the fact that Melina outside designated Princess "found that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest is not as Queen."</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle was at the last very elusive with the press, and there was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, that is, at last, the essence of the National Beauty Contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who is committed to the social needs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, before entering the contest are already involved in projects," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is also speculation that Valle guilty by its flaws in the fibrosis derriere and that he noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose as the candidate "natural beauty" with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsibly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The developer Queens Jorge Hernan Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, "but your problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very visible, it dropped points in the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos believes that the error of the surgery vallecaucana were practised.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The surgeries are good, but not the Valley was able to do.</seg>
<seg id="29">His body was never strong and here is the cost. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For this award, which for the first time released the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in a bathing costume emerged a cruel heralding that last night was met, it was said that this was that Raymundo contentillo denied to Melina not to give you a taste of the Crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Reality or not, the fact is that Melina since today begins a year reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives you the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for designation of the National Contest.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will go down in history as one of the Queens that despite its overwhelming step by Cartagena, was elusive Crown.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">A Cali lofoscopista went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these officials is key.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On 4 November a CTI lofoscopista Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the main leader of the Farc, "Alfonso Cano", through the collation of their fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven who work at the station lofoscopistas CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada carried 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where many times had to be placed by more than five days in the jungle to arrive at the site where the bodies were to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley, and then to conduct training courses, specializing in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar warned him to carry a minimum clothing for three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Something big is expected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Friday night left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="11">I knew that it should identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was the man who headed the oldest guerrillas in the world, so I asked him to carry the 10-finger card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, it was very different from what he had seen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was without a beard dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the signs do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a Eliazar transplantador and a flashlight, comparing the fingerprints of the body with the card.</seg>
<seg id="16">His eye was not ruled: "Alfonso Cano."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That same night, the man native Puerto Tejada was to confirm to the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the main leader of the Farc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In search of the footprint</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For one of the Cali dactiloscopista Sijín recognition that made the President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference by the operation against "Cano," is very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people are not aware of our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an exact science dactiloscopia, with no margin for error, which may prove to be key in solving crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Apart from the identification of corpses, lofoscopistas support research for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of persons captured.</seg>
<seg id="23">When caught, many offenders present false papers or papers.</seg>
<seg id="24">We take the fingerprinting and seek in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The investigator told that, in a case of theft, it fell to him to remove a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported their power to take a vault full of jewellery and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to draw a fingerprint - but, in that case, we were able to obtain the footprint of any hand and identify the offender, who had participated in various thefts," he recalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Fingerprints may also exclude or reaffirm suspects in murder cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">I recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Through the investigation, it was determined that a family member might be suspected of the crime and, indeed, an imprint on the bottle coincided.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this does not guarantee that it has been the murderer, it is found at the scene of the crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A CTI dactiloscopista explained that the objects' fingerprints are drawn with physical or chemical reagents. "</seg>
<seg id="32">When they appear, they use a tape transplantador or to lift them.</seg>
<seg id="33">After that, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the database of crime, or to the Registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," indicated the expert from the CTI.</seg>
<seg id="35">He clarified that not everything is as shown in the television programme CSI.</seg>
<seg id="36">As well as not all that glitters is gold, not everything that touches turns footprint.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The members of the Movement takes Wall Street challenged this Tuesday to the authorities in New York to try to come back, under the umbrella of a court order, to the square of Manhattan where they were evicted from early morning and trying to occupy another Park in the Great Manzana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of protesters in the square agolpaban Zuccotti, where they wanted to access through a court order allowing the "indignant" return to camp at the scene, while another part of the Movement responded to the eviction to occupy a park to the north of the city, where there has been further arrests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp out in the square, we are going to install elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the Movement, "took Wall Street", Mark Bray.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He explained that the response of the "indignant" at the eviction from their camp made personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived at court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay camped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In addition, the "indignant" came to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the centre of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity Church.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At least for one hour managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although he could not confirm the specific figure, while assured Efe that saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Organization ensures that several hundred people had been installed at that point, which already has shifted a delegation of religious leaders in a show of support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, the square Zuccotti - which is a compound of private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday, which must review the legality of the evacuation of this morning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Some of the protesters displaced until there were allocated to these hours and copies of the court order and even surrendered to officers guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who complained that some officers beat demonstrators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The injunction prohibits authorities to evict members of takes Wall Street or implement "laws that were published after the onset of the occupation or ban the protesters re-entering the park with tents or other properties that used previously."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Mayor Bloomberg outlined in the press that, owing to the court order, the city had suspended the re-opening of the space to the public and to the protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to return to install with tents and sleeping bags.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The eviction regidor defended personally carried out dawn of Zuccotti Square, an operation which saw around 200 arrests and decided that the protesters were "violating the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "in a place where people do not venÍan to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others," because "some business habÍan received threats" and "temÍan neighbors for their quality of life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"the eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the Movement, who accused the Mayor of "lacking the respect for freedom of expression."</seg>

<seg id="2">GDP grew 1.5 per cent thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst natural disaster in the country nipón since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo pinned material losses at $300 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of declines, the figure of GDP between July and September, served to turn the page, definitely: GDP rose 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter and 6 percent in annualized rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is, moreover, the fastest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery is due, in part, for the Rally of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, companies increased their investment in a 1.1%, compared to the decline of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditures to be observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted rises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the real trigger of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that invited to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.</seg>
<seg id="11">This variable broke a 1 per cent, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.</seg>

<seg id="13">Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen, Japan's currency - has become one of the "safe haven" selected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for US, a privilege that weighs a regions in the accounts of exporting companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose survival is determined by the economic health of large groups of the technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September to the value of the yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While the markets remain with their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lower our guard.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We must be alert to the risks that remain, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.</seg>

<seg id="1">The CDU proposes to elect the President of Europe by universal suffrage</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the Congress of the Union (Christian Democrat) and European Democrats (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democrat party.</seg>
<seg id="3">Initially had not been included in the agenda for the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the policy of the Government is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="4">The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the leadership, was adopted practically unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">standing ovation for the several minutes it won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, will allay any possible doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The key idea of the Chancellor, and the motion, summarized in a slogan: "The response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For the Chancellor, "The time has come to open the way in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="10">This could occur in the amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage, "to give a face to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="11">In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Certainly, it is unlikely that the 27 to reach an early agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the ball is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority of the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank in terms of weight of each economy, which obviously would reinforce the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Eager to calm tempers within his party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is it has tried to win over its Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentado in France.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except in passing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleon.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The incidence of fraud in sick leave</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government launched an offensive against the sickness.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the subject, as appellant since 2007, of the fight against fraud and punished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Moreover, to accompany this offensive, that part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls a linchpin of the presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of absence before they can take the low.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill lost four days of pay, i.e. a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that would save $280 million euros, according to Les Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moreover, it would be accompanied by another measure with a reach more symbolic: impose officials a day of absence without pay in the event of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">As we discuss these issues, the majority returns to put on the table as the question of fraud, this time directed towards the abuse of parental leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They will substantially increase the controls and, furthermore, if someone was caught in a fraud to repay the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand, speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Like the other cases, the impact of the announcement seemed slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the area of low labour.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, since 2002, is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched several offensives policies that normally have borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French do not become ill more than in the rest of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Look carefully, firstly, national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the French Institute of social Security (CNAM), in 2006, was paid more than EUR 237 million in benefits for leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute research and documentation in economics of health, subsidies for low represented, in 2008, 5 percent of health-care spending, rising to $11.3 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 percent is connected with the sickness, a figure that amounts to $6.2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consequently, 2.5% of health spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have grabbed an average of   14.5 days off work, compared with $17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Group Alma Consulting.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average that, without doubt, hides diversions: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster. com, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 employees of French respondents claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010, 37% of the sickness lasted less than 8 days, 22 per cent of between 8 and 14 days, 15 percent of between 15 days a month, and 15 per cent of between one and three months and 11 percent were more protracted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to get sick.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons and otherwise) ranged in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud in the sickness is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id="25">The fraud has a rather limited.</seg>
<seg id="26">The reinforcement of the legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of the sickness of more than 45 days are systematic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the NCWA found, in 13% of 285,000 made, that the casualties of short duration were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, found that 11% of the cases were "properly adapted or unjustified; a figure, taking as a total of $1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Therefore, it makes a total of 169,000 cases "unjustified" among several million workers who caught a sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="30">Without doubt, a miniscule compared with, for example, the black economy.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of revenue of between 9,000 and $15 million euros per year, i.e., more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, without doubt, significantly more than the fraud in this last area.</seg>

<seg id="1">A committee of experts said that they should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Canadians live denying the death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian society lives denying death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, only 9% of Canadians is ready to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make provisions to that effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including the ethical, legal and medical.</seg>
<seg id="7">This Committee recommends that the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">For a start, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of the death in 40 countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada ranks tenth post, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of the death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians wishes to die at home, just 68.6 per cent of them died in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, the highest rate in this regard the registers Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it wishes to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its implementation, i.e., the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not competent or who have not given their consent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries that have not been legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"in Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in Canada is practised assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Canadians, favouring euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, since we believe that allowing persons whose death is next to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey conducted by Angus Reid in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, 66 per cent believed that the fact of legalizing euthanasia will not understand that the lives of the elderly or disabled people have less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">With regard to the people who have practised assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believed that it should not start proceedings against them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, among its recommendations suggest that specified in the penal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Committee of Experts also seeks to train health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient will reject the attendance at the end of their lives without fear to deal with a complaint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, in connection with the palliative sedation or terminal, which is already used extensively in health institutions of Canada, the Committee calls that, except that serve to reduce the physical pain, are seen as euthanasia and are subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other experts expressed reservations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Other experts in the area of the Law of health have already expressed their reservations in connection with the findings of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in Health Law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who have signed the report because, among other things, is not restricted the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy over any other value of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The specialist in Health Law Margaret Somerville also expressed its "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which he called a "manifesto for euthanasia."</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questioned the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The crimes and offences against Muslims have risen nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the other types of racial and religious violence has decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., has increased by 49 per cent, compared to an increase of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in the crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and offences anti-religious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly 6.628 until the cases, of which a 47.3 percent is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that have returned to increase this type of crimes and offences", highlighted the human rights organisation Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," The organization said in a statement.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">"The Human Rights First has long noting that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," said an official of the Organization, Paul Legendre.</seg>

<seg id="2">Introduction of a "Golden Rule" budget in the Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Government of grand coalition Social Democrat / Christian Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "Golden Rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign Note of Austria by the rating agencies (triple A).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It was the same Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure far above the upper limit of 60 per cent set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"If you reduce the solvency of Austria on one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay $3 billion more in interest each year," said Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Austria responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to member countries of the euro zone for the past 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or an Act with equivalent value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The measure taken by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt that kind of "rule".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease each year at 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, beginning in 2017, the structural budget deficit of the federal State should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while regional states and municipalities, should submit balanced budgets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The aim is that, in 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the criterion of 60 per cent set by the Maastricht Treaty.</seg>

<seg id="5">On Tuesday, the yen rose to reach around the historic highs that led to the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan's currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the US currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But the yen has been increasing steadily since then, driven by purchases of investors who view it as a "safe haven" value in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The dollar again been listed on Tuesday at less than 77 yen, and the euro has fallen below the symbolic Bar of 105 yen, reaching a level close to those who caused the last intervention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro in more than 160 yen.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday of a two-day meeting of its Board of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Energy policy:</seg>
<seg id="2">The facts are worth more than the dogmas</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If there is an issue that can not be treated in light of short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, is the energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is appropriate that an electoral event is the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will only be useful if it considers the whole of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must base its opinion on objective facts, in sound data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Now we are seven billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will mean duplication of the electric demand before 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the global population of a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, we will have to address the increasing scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why Germany stands alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is not the case in Belgium, which subjects himself to the need to find a source capable of replacing, or Switzerland, that only objective is to build plants in the last generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, continue with determination with their projects.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States, by his side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit at the Park, picking up the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, based on renewable energies, sometimes as an example, the reality is against this speech.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will mean a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, including Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a few months, it was felt the harmful effects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We must think about the case of Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="19">Champion of Europe in the wind industry, which gets 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the perseverance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than the French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the utility industry in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would undercut realism to the wonderful statements on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, they are not opposed in principle to this type of energy, polls show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Widely export-oriented, covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and create jobs that can not deslocalizables.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMES and the loss of $6 billion per year in exports of French nuclear equipment and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">What electrician responsible an APR designed to function sixty years, when it is expected that the collapse of its manufacturer?</seg>
<seg id="28">To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is a miraculous source of electricity production, like there is a diabolical source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The development by Areva solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the complementary nature of the sources of energy.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy, it is imperative to maintain the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a security authority which exercises strict control and transparent on both existing plants as the construction of Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.</seg>
<seg id="33">In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one, the Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions, causing no consequences for people and the environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Chernobyl, the accident was caused by the design of the reactor and some human error unforgivable.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German manufacturers and operators, the RPA presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While the study all electrical players who wish to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for competitors from Areva and EDF, because that would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and manoeuvring dominasen a partisan debate so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative subjected to political figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who had come to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclaiming of past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters."</seg>
<seg id="4">However, rarely discusses from an economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The issue is that, on this issue, there is considerable consensus between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set guidelines stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers," while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard, explaining that France "can not handle all the misery of the world" in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the degree of generosity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.</seg>
<seg id="9">On both sides, it is believed that immigrants are a burden for the economy and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the level of generosity with which they operate with regard to immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include trivia, indicating that the "co-development will solve the problem of migration."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is electorally profitable, but economically goes very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As economists point Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that sums up the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 pp), there is a broad consensus among scientists about the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The limitation of immigration hurts weakening growth and employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace national workers, especially for the low-skilled, pushing to reduce their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for national workers and exercise mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Low-skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract national workers and more skilled in dynamic sectors where the formation does not meet the demand for staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the same way that a surgeon would struggle to work in a country with a lack of anaesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes that the arrival of recent positive difference in wages and employment of nationals.</seg>
<seg id="20">In light of the foregoing, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows presents a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that bring immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth, there is a large proportion of Nobel laureates naturalized Americans and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Immigrants also are net contributors to the social systems, because they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less cost) of 150,000 euros in public budgets of average throughout his life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek points of growth that he lacked "teeth".</seg>
<seg id="25">These teeth, who dissuaded immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The current crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political crisis and democratic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Greek referendum palinodia verdadero-falso had, in this regard, revealing a double effect: it showed the need for a strong return from the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of the impossibility of his inconsistency.</seg>

<seg id="15">There is No crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would know where they end up the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole of Europe is bowing to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is the whole of Europe, which is a humiliation in the international arena.</seg>
<seg id="18">We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of their nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The most urgent need is to regain popular sovereignty over the helm of the European project.</seg>
<seg id="20">Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free from markets and prepare for the future through investments.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that may not be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Having long struggled against this proposal from the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is now a European economic governance.</seg>
<seg id="23">So be it.</seg>

<seg id="26">To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.</seg>

<seg id="1">The cards with chip without contact "spread"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Hall of the global chip cards began Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic mood.</seg>
<seg id="3">Indeed, the year 2011 should end with an 11 per cent increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, mobile phones and SIM cards, etc.), with a total of $6 million units, according to estimates by the Cabinet Eurosmart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The segment is the most powerful technology without contact, which allows the joint transportation or purchases simply approaching the card at a reader.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Its quota should continue to rise in 2012 (includes 580 million units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for cards with chip 6,925 million (card).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Europe, which has long been left behind in the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the sector of the payment without contact.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">In France, its beginnings are more modest: they are using 400,000 Visa cards without contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the supermarkets work by four.</seg>
<seg id="11">Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million cards MasterCard Pass without contact.</seg>
<seg id="12">To get the gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to its customers.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There are two big French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminate in the future, among its clients, bank cards with the system without contact," said Gérard Nébouy, general Manager of Visa Europe France.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Banks prove payment via mobile phone</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, there are few devices equipped with technology NFC (Near Field Communication), essential to conduct transactions.</seg>
<seg id="17">"are falling behind."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but should finally experience a real boom in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We anticipate that it will sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 throughout the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">But banks take the lead.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Bank Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.</seg>
<seg id="22">The iPhone will be equipped with about 200 customers and partners with a foundation that allows the payment without contact.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has a similar project BPCE in Strasbourg and Marseille.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the Société Générale has also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer to allow their customers to pay without contact via their mobiles.</seg>

<seg id="1">Of the Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) had appeared as well and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, which have long suspected, have been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even Algiers has already stated that "certainty".</seg>
<seg id="5">"The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," explained, without providing further details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by persons associated with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day, along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the rubble of the intervention, the French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Terrorist axis</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study of callers indicated by several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly attracted the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other by a man who, presumably, is near Aqmi and the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is an achievement, but surely we should expect to own more formal evidence before speaking of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But it is possible."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial support and intellectual outside and which is increasingly active," says Nigerian Kunle Amuwo, an investigator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In recent months, these "props" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operational methods, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex, and in the same style than those used by Aqmi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, beginning with Washington is pressuring Muscat since to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to view the group as a community of theorists unworthy of interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A quick success</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and a fundamentalist Imam, Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, hausa (which means "Western education is a sin"), to encourage the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this poor region, the Association is experiencing a rapid success.</seg>
<seg id="22">Politicization and requires a strict adherence to sharia law, while its militants took to the fight against the infidel central Government.</seg>
<seg id="23">The latter are aimed first at churches, pubs, administrations.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were particularly active and multiplied attacks against the police.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reaction of Muscat was, as so often happens, widespread.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army attacked the town and there were 800 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since then, the sect is radicalizing and abandon their fiefdoms in the north.</seg>
<seg id="29">Last Christmas, claiming an attack that cause 80 killed in Jos, and then another in Abuja.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, Boko Haram returned to attack against Muscat, in particular against the headquarters protected by the police, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes his first international goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of an axis terrorist in Africa, from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, unsettling all specialists in security.</seg>
<seg id="33">While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that Somalis Al-Chebab of operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all information."</seg>

<seg id="1">The world according to Republican candidates for the Presidency</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In relation to China, with Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in naivety and lack of knowledge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic?</seg>
<seg id="4">Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that it is.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been increasingly estruendosas statements and shortcuts in terms of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Extend the slogans, often infundamentados on China, Iran, aid to Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination by the Grand Old Party, has threatened to bring the Chinese before the WTO and report them "by manipulating its currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of fragments of the entire sector towards Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, Obama's former Ambassador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drown before an attitude that "apabulla" emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has asked for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the style of Reagan</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If I am elected, want to Iran," fanfarroneó.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If Obama gets re-elected, they will have the bomb."</seg>
<seg id="16">He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with their obligations under that partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Businessman Herman Cain, the candidate with the second best classified, for its part, shows a shameful lack of such items.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, urging a counterbalance to the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to develop nuclear capability ", apparently ignoring the fact that China is already available to the military atom since 1964.</seg>
<seg id="19">tejano Governor Rick Perry, who supported Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, said that, for its part, is ready to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight the drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="20">The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, as advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are considerable differences with the Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Opponents of the current President replied that Reagan was also simple ideas and we won the Cold War.</seg>
<seg id="23">Recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">They insist, quite rightly, in the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit from the "guys" of Iraq and in their misrepresentations in Libya, and labeled as weak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But the attacks are not simple.</seg>
<seg id="26">The population judges of a rather positive balance of national security of Obama, who finished with Bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Iraq, distrust of military interventions that generate a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="28">And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Nord Stream pipeline, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must provide gas to meet the needs of 30 million homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra bufet and a delicate, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the Sea, Russia with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have revolved together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in the network of Western Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new pipeline, each year will arrive   27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas additional to Western Europe via a first took of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of   $55 million cubic metres of gas, i.e., enough to cover the entire French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, there is already talk of the possibility of constructing a third tube for the same journey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents an air of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Poland and the Baltic countries were firmly opposed to the project.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the Nord Stream will provide gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Suddenly, these two countries lose some of its power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening to shut him access to the markets of Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet Pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, to support the Russian draft, has gained greater security of supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a gap between Europeans in East and West.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has known in just five years, to succeed his vision of a direct partnership between Russia and Western countries rich, big consumers of gas and with some reservations increasingly limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"this pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organic form," confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating how big contracts in the gas sector are as much political as economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tube submarine is made of laminated steel, cement to protect it against the anchors of ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">It supports in the bottom of the Sea, at an average of 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precautionary measure," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for the company Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was necessary to step up the protection of wildlife.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted along its entire length: either by valves, nor by seasons of maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was provided a platform of control in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project renounced the same to see that the Swedes were unwilling to allow a Russian state-owned company was established on a permanent basis in the sea off its coast.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the event of failure, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of the escape, the gas pipeline, therefore, will be released into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the builders consider unlikely that there will be an escape, since they have planned junturas, which is expected to have an escape from 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The control of the State of the pipeline is guaranteed by a robot submarine, dragged down by a ship, which carries out field inspections, as well as through a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the shape of a cigar, into the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of a metre, and moves with gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on potential distortions of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any kind of redress.</seg>
<seg id="36">The movement of the gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">The principle is 200 bars and, out of 100 bars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have joined forces to undertake this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The company leader is Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">It joined the German E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch and the French group Gasunie GDF Suez (9% each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">With its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favourable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Later, Gazprom rented to the company, during a period of 25 years, the whole of renewable transport capabilities of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is really transport," said Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the input of shareholders and 70 per cent through bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the work should reach $7.4 million for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached $240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But minority shareholders are sure not to exceed its investment, because Gazprom assumes alone the risk of expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, in a sandy coast of planted Pines.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some valves, with 4.5 metres in height, form the exit door of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">There are few sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before being transferred to the German pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moleskine notebook, a brand.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Created a half-century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to send people a taste for the script.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Has a whiff of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The book, Moleskine is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pasta, its rubber sheets, their white ears, as aging at the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, with the current aspect Moleskine notebooks were born in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to throw the market a notebook of design, but distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">By that time, Maria Sebregondi consulting company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book was inspired by an ancient technique of production, the huge amount of mole skin (skin), which refers to a cotton barnizado used, among other things, to cover the stools.</seg>
<seg id="9">This type of book was highly valued by writers and travellers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an object old and forgotten, an icon of the pioneering artists until the 20th century," account Maria Sebregondi, since he became responsible for the brand in Mode mode.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">And it reached the success.</seg>
<seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.</seg>
<seg id="13">Far has been the production of confidential early years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to   70 countries, from France to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen as students and professionals.</seg>
<seg id="16">Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, and open spirit cults.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its inception, now owns nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.</seg>
<seg id="18">Circulated their notebooks in bookstores, since the Fnac until the small shops in the city centre, and has managed to impose their identity.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.</seg>
<seg id="20">This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists put his own book.</seg>
<seg id="21">In August, also launched a notebook with covers of leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Building on its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify their products: handbags, notebooks, pens, covers of computer... the brand encompasses a wide range of supports.</seg>
<seg id="23">A success that provokes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the Investment Fund, GS Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 19 percent of disabled people are looking for a job.</seg>
<seg id="3">The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a strong public policy, implemented since 2005, the rate of unemployment among disabled people is double the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Desalentadora?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No," says Eric Blanchet, general Manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the progress achieved since fifteen years are considerable.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher than the average.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, there is still much to be done."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It is worth mentioning that unemployed persons with disabilities continue to face many obstacles to access to employment.</seg>
<seg id="11">They tend to have older: 37 percent has over 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">With a low level of qualification: 80% had not finished high school, and   2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the long-term unemployment is rife among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38 percent of average.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is, there are many issues that impede especially the return to the world of work, "which constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, general Manager of Tremplin, a partnership founded in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These are the obstacles objectives.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mindset of the people, but it is moving too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A survey conducted in April by the Association for the Cité IMS-Entreprendre noted that managers surveyed have "a level of knowledge on disability under" with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are   very far from the goal of recruiting a 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in an Act of 1987....</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, reaching a ratio of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"now reached around 3 per cent," says Pierre Blanc, general Manager of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The evidence: the number of establishment "under this provision," as the amounts disbursed, have declined between 2007 and 2011, from $59 to 46,000 structures and 606 (480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated a great deal of pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, in particular among large groups."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 percent of companies that have between 20 and 49 employees with disabled employees on its payroll, compared to 82% of businesses between 100 and 199 workers.</seg>
