<seg id="1">The hairdressers also has to be a good psychologist, argue professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In introductory article, how they learn the estilistas, because I complained about a bit of that initial lessons were already quite loaded.</seg>
<seg id="3">Had no idea of how things would go.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conferences of three professionals in the industry, how to clothe problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of spectacle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer are final exams, more information and practical tasks await us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And although the course develops every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.</seg>
<seg id="8">Time we have studied with the Director, Alena, (in the course no man) on how to dress a woman that is not a perfect symmetry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And that is the vast majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a figure estilizada without the proper curves and someone is overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hairdressers has know soften optically some broad shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the curves necessary</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We have given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women the type of Jennifer Lopez, breasts and hips huge waist but close and at the same time not customary law too defiant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers not adapt, worth be sewing at least one piece of fabric extra measure.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly not been arrepentirán, because the clothes that feel perfectly is unpayable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">With a skirt to measure will feel much better than with a not to move, get up, danced in the waist, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Corps estilizado be allowed to wear clothing with folds, jewellery, embroidery or drapeados.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are certainly many types of information and of various bodies, so I am glad that I have a whole week to bring order in my head all this information.</seg>
<seg id="18">And even so, I am afraid that with the task assigned, I already have more than satisfied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">To each participant in the workshop was assigned two famous, those who must design two changing rooms: one for the day and another for the night.</seg>
<seg id="20">Needs to take into account the current aspect, the fashionable style suited to the person in question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I touched on "Clothing" to Miranda Kerr, perhaps the conozcáis of the campaign of Victoria's secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Cry inside for me is a lot better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, which lately have engordado around 100 kilos (please, take into consideration the overstatement), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes we must recortarlos of magazines or search for Internet and imprimirlos, for after drafting them graphically.</seg>
<seg id="24">The moodboard, which is like being called the complete result, further expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Is also important to think about the part of the graphic estilismo.</seg>
<seg id="26">The hairdressers, therefore, you are in not only physically, but also covers, for example, of pages of products in magazines (specific topics, as trends, bags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">Of all this we spoke the hairdressers and designer Mario kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But all this already left for Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The hairdressers have to have a global vision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Three invited experts encouraged the Conference on Saturday with information on all sorts of bodies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The hairdressers Honza pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub polanka and the fashion photographer Ben renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the hairdressers saberle should capitalise on this.</seg>
<seg id="33">And hairdressers work with knows a good one and the same item of clothing in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">Variability is, in this case, crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Thus, such gabardina (or as they say in English, the trench-coat) can clothe the classic with jeans and T-shirt, but also serves to clothe the naked body with shoes and tacón fotografiarlo as if it was in reality a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or well enough arremangarla and boarded the neck to get a different image entirely.</seg>
<seg id="37">"jugad with this ," we insisted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">What I appreciate most is the following advice: "to start working, we need to first conozcáis all the rules'.</seg>
<seg id="39">"then you can already romperlas," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally I was unclear why memorizamos all those formulas, which combines with what, why, if it then proves that in magazines fashionable we are different results.</seg>
<seg id="41">Do not speak of the parades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a hairdressers must have more types of clothes in the reservation which seeks to photograph.</seg>
<seg id="43">As well, to a history of fashion that takes ten pages (therefore ten outfits), we must be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And in addition to the photos, clothing works in combination with other garments, all of them different from those which are in use in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Honza pokorný assured us that the image and style represent themselves, in many cases, half of the success.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna, that is not exactly a singer extraordinary, but the image and the márquetin have made her an Global Star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of the estilistas.</seg>
<seg id="49">Until the celebrity so too are futile (me enough my skills, my physical appearance is not as important).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And when someone asks us our services, we must bear in mind that it is highly likely that indicate a carving very different to hers real (minor).</seg>
<seg id="51">Then only guglear remains and ascertain whether the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has engordado / thinned, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the hairdressers is not enough focus on fashion, but must understand of outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">During your work above all they must communicate with the people that you are in, so it is crucial to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">Knows to value the people, is not less, defends his views.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"when a Director was os hires to Le clasifiquéis costumes and completéis with fine clothes, you cannot catch and throw everything he had and said:" Huy What horror .""</seg>
<seg id="56">"encontrad at least a couple of things to weigh podáis and recommend for someone they can get," says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Himself also showed us that everything should be on the so-called "placovka ," i.e. the labour exchange.</seg>
<seg id="58">This sets around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. There is also a thread of nailon (which she serves to hairdressers during the meeting of photos of products such as handbags or caps), double-pincer special hiring of clothing ahead, if this was the greater (alfileres and other enganches are not allowed, it could damage the fabric), or a game of sewing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">To not sit in the passive listening and put something in practice, we have learned to take the usually of shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even during meetings of photos in the study, in a flat surface, it could damage the often and much more still outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And did no more than observe and take.</seg>
<seg id="63">Could not touch the shoes with the scissors to not harm them by accident.</seg>
<seg id="64">So we had to be very resourceful.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario has given me joy to commend my work without reservations.</seg>
<seg id="66">The truth is that I was not very well give those skills.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a small part of all those that we have heard during the whole weekend, in the second part of the course.</seg>
<seg id="68">Already I notice that devote myself to estilismo a professional level it is not a path of roses, but I get exactly like what people say.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated because of a series of oversights improper of a routine trip during question time tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4">To some extent be managed to meet expectations, but it is nothing if, in reality, was not intended to do anything special.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new delivery, to which the title adds the run, had raised high expectations already before its premiere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Promised that would give new Aires to the old saga racing of need for speed and, as a result of what shown, appears as a game we should not end up being another time a gender action without further.</seg>
<seg id="7">We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character falling car and walk on their own feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As usually happens in the series for NFS, the results would not vary much regard to what we had hoped.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are careers that can be given by acceptable, but in counting the total lost points because of absurd judgments, which are already appearing in the series since years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">In reality cannot be called or mistakes, but rather is about the unwillingness of incomprehensible programmers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Is os introduces in a story whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to resolve them, he offers to participate in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">Os sentáis at the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea is to offer something interesting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The map is divided into ten stages and, then, in more than 50 races.</seg>
<seg id="16">It follows that each race takes place by a different route and stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="17">That way, no one is remotely the feeling that the game always provided the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some of the environments become even drier in sight, although the technical level the figure is equivalent to previous deliveries of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore, it is not very snappy.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the walk across the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a visual impact very pleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Moreover, the careers are diversifying from time to time by a feature atypical.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, for example, in the desert os encontráis a storm of sand that dims visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">In contrast, in the mountains we must take care not to os sepulte an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">According to this, each racing is very well developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are only a couple of models, but this is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a moment, intentáis overtake a number of rival required (as in a normal race classic), after tratáis to win time (mourning classic cronometrado) and then you expected a duel against a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">Amid all this sometimes appears the police, which only further hinder things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The novelty are landscapes outside the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">Presents interactive animations when Jack, in most cases, had to escape from someone and you possess that help him, always pulsando the right button at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising, however, that there are many fewer landscapes in the game of what could be expected (in particular there are only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">But the end result is positive, because this element is not to be rude and, in the aforementioned context, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model driving follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.</seg>
<seg id="34">That means that today is no longer a great thing, but it cannot be said to be bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">Buscáis if a simulation realistic, since you can look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But to a race conceived with enough action suits him quite this style of driving, but can we find something better among the Games competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, everything in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But problems arise after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike correct models driving, no longer happens the same with collisions.</seg>
<seg id="40">Games of this type cannot expect recree deformities and collisions complicated, but indeed before a coup against any object, you cannot predict how we will react your car, which not everything is in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is typical that, to make bringing forward a very tight or circular the car with a traffic normal, so only have been slight friction, but in other situations almost identical, just doing your car pirouetting unguided.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even just totally destroyed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Through the system of reseteo, arise not big problems, but it can stand bad humour.</seg>
<seg id="44">The reseteos are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or Te sales of the runway, the game Te redraws the last point of rescue in the runway.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, in each race is only has five reseteos available.</seg>
<seg id="46">If the consumís all, you must restart the race from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus is nothing more than a help in the event of something not going well, but it is not very trustworthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, nor the reseteo aid, only aid the learned the given phase of memory.</seg>
<seg id="49">A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.</seg>
<seg id="50">In some curves, for example, we must enter a specific mode; otherwise, they are impossible to take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Other times os encontráis somewhere vehicles "civilians " always with the same configuration, although you are the former, or fifths lleguéis five minutes before or after.</seg>
<seg id="52">This makes rabiar especially in situations when see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent without pre-empting problems, but when you have arrived, you must be either curb.</seg>
<seg id="53">Is equal when lleguéis, because that is programmed by the "surprise" always happen in front of your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents also have one more advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">During the entire starting llegaréis to sites where, without taking into account the time, always os will front-load the same adversary in the same site.</seg>
<seg id="56">Furthermore this comes at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.</seg>
<seg id="57">Your opponent must come before you, the price that is.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it goes in front of you, OS makes the vision of the cars that come up, so that the principle you can make papilla the car.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely os disappoint immediately.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is a pity, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so that often it is not possible to continue to detail what happened or where.</seg>
<seg id="61">And really bothered, if the credit is the idea with fifty clues exclusive or the classification in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must be attentive to the pumps petrol roadside, precisely because there you have to switch car, although in the great majority of cases suffice os which possess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports are suited for urban areas, the indictments strong Americans for motorways straight and the exotic superdeportivos for a driving technique, for example, by mountain roads with curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Also main narrative thread is also a thread of challenges parallel, i.e. there are careers in specific places that conoceréis by stories.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here conseguiréis not only medals, but also points to experience your profile, which serves both to the challenges as the tales.</seg>
<seg id="68">To reach the upper tier, the driver he opened several possibilities, starting with the car and ending funds for the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the same time, there is a connected autolog role online that compares your results with those of other players and disponibiliza other community functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the most difficult elements to understand is how it is done. The last race in history.</seg>
<seg id="71">With the car you have arrived until the subway tunnel (PASS), where os ponéis to run a dark for the tracks (PASS).</seg>
<seg id="72">The Speedometers os marks between 150 and 200 km / h (PASS), and suddenly, behind os comes the convoy subway and os leads ahead without more.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the wording we certainly will have a discussion on this for several days, whether during the programming of the game none ever thought a little, or if the authors really take us by a bunch of bobos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the general visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes until soberbios.</seg>
<seg id="75">Because what a pity that, in the most tense moments it reduces the image quality and sometimes a serious way.</seg>
<seg id="76">This particularly affects accidents where there are involved many participants, when the quality of continuous view is no longer valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The audio is good and the band Sonora is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">To enable s liking to the greater part of the youth group, the band Sonora belongs to the category "each of her father and her mother," but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">End the sense of need for speed: the run is therefore quite confusing.</seg>
<seg id="80">Whether the game avoid mistakes absolutely stupid, we would have problems in stating that the run is the best game NFS of recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">Get the feeling that the game is not over.</seg>
<seg id="82">Fun is insured, but make ready because the mistakes you will strike in the eyes with the force of about reflectors airport.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ambassador to the EU, vicenová:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs have a reputation of negativistas and Eurosceptics.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly impacted the balance between individual institutions"</seg>
<seg id="4">"I am not expecting montase was a merciless war."</seg>
<seg id="5">"will last five, six years before the situation stabilizes a bit, it calms and the new players become accustomed to their new roles," thus began with conviction its conference at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How not take seriously its slogan "clear and openly about Europe," which he said already in the first part of its conference, when it managed to describe each organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, which would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Vicenová ponderó also the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"They first emerge criticism, which is if insulso, an official grey, able to assume any role, but I have to say left everyone confused, because their assumed roles to perfection."</seg>
<seg id="9">"is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 States, communicate with them and that has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new post of Representative of the foreign policy and security explained from the question: 'who is this EU? What number I can call it?'. It is thus an important step towards the unification and clarification of EU policy vis-à-vis States such as China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Nobody wants prohibirnos cheese of Olomouc</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Vicenová had also addressed the agenda remained, remains and will the European Council in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech Presidency two years ago was a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs took on the economic crisis, emerging, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the Government at that time was identified as a highly negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU has at the moment many commitments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of Ambassador: "a good hubbub," not just the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which now being treated.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furthermore, we must approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, a much more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the budget is most simple and effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries are to receive greater support and which less? That is something that will be present in the agenda of the next meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Ambassador also recalled their main slogans, with those who came to Europe: "over Europe with clarity."</seg>
<seg id="21">"What is true is that I do not like the abbreviations ugly, the extranjerismos or the jargon that people don't understand."</seg>
<seg id="22">"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels are not invented really cucumbers rods or curved cucumbers, bananas or of various sizes that nobody we going to ban the cheese of Olomouc?."</seg>
<seg id="23">Also seeks to make better use of the environment of the EU and citizens closer to most Czechs to the European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">US hopes Europe of the speeds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and the people perceive the negative aspects rather than positive ones.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fault is a multitude of factors, as the modesty of our candidates, his inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support from the Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, underscored the strength and the collaboration of the Visegrad Group.</seg>
<seg id="29">"believe me that when they come to me, a Polish and a Hungarian and I was on a Slovak, a Frenchman at my side I said: 'what, as you have been, as the Group of Visegrad?," and is not to do him no mercy. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the future in the EU, according to vicenová, ahead of new regulations harsh budgetary policy in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="31">Is perceived as something very real concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, over which the new "the European Federation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have countries in the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."</seg>
<seg id="34">"It was first said that only those countries which want to cooperate, and which not, outside it."</seg>
<seg id="35">"These procedures will be increasingly and reinforce Europe of the two speeds," it expects vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this connection, it also emphasized the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues that affect the whole of the EU should be debated between Member States, not only among the members of the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brand story:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If someone find a term to investigate with great precision the strategy of IBM, the approximate more would be "long term ."</seg>
<seg id="4">To the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is seen as the current, however, and have gone 100 years since its foundation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this character largoplacista put the first head of the signing, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.</seg>
<seg id="6">Already He coined the slogan that many of the world's problems have solution if people are prepared to believe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Its slogan "think!" became their hallmark, around which will build the life of the future (giant was also the title of an internal newsletter that IBM began publishing in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">Watson was also the basis of an enterprise culture carefully lifted.</seg>
<seg id="9">"for us, IBM involves a long-term thinking, a steady movement in the direction of the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and thrived during 100 years for that reason, because remained true to its core principles, but without fear to changes around.</seg>
<seg id="11">That has allowed us, for our first century, transforming technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hope to prosper even more in our second century, "said during its anniversary, the current manager Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A sophisticated system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, already in the 1930s, was keen for the care of its employees as the businessman baťa in Czechia (employees of IBM were among the first operators that Americans have enjoyed holidays, secure, and elegant uniforms a sophisticated system of remuneration no rewards for those that the best inventors and sellers.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same sophistication long-term the IBM retained in the relationship with the client.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world in ending discrimination of any type, could choose without problems).</seg>
<seg id="17">In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan by IBM, whereby Palmisano replace it next year a woman: Virginia rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">It already has worked 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">During recent years IBM has participated in so-called encounters virtual, rain of ideas online, the emerging myriad of future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not surprisingly sobren ideas, because in the signature work almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong image internal and external.</seg>
<seg id="23">"from the beginning, IBM had a concept of the institution over which technology works," says the economist Professor at the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM rosabeth MOSS kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve problems for users of business technology," said George colony of Forrester Research consultant.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself said there is a difference between going into the business and create a business directly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the US affectionately, because of its logo, has become the last 100 years in one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is possibly the technology company more versatile (develops both teams as programmes, infrastructure and services, accommodation Web within a wide range of services, ranging from servers until nanotechnology).</seg>
<seg id="28">Holds the largest number of patents every American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Between their inventions are the ATM, the payment cards, the SWAps, the bar-coding and the diskettes.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM billed this year 220 billion dollars. This year it has become the second signature technological by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when surpassed for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the time (IBM was based not on its own operating system, OS / 2, online service Prodigy or computers IBM pcjr).</seg>
<seg id="33">"If your business is based in advance, cannot blend emotionally in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms (and equally, if they are not, the leaves).</seg>
<seg id="35">And that the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically is maintained and always falls exclusively with windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Technology future</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In question sales, IBM is devoted mainly to services, of which approximately one fifth are programmes and another fifth of teams.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, in 1990 the teams accounted for over half of the share of vendors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets with a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, has invested $58 billion in buying technology future.</seg>
<seg id="40">Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time witnessed the modern global financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM acts according to the assumptions of its first leader, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis from 29 increased investments.</seg>
<seg id="42">Seems so now IBM has managed to weather the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the shares of IBM since the start of 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The currency of IBM is change everything except their value.</seg>
<seg id="45">We can therefore expect when the next crisis comes, this giant flexible aguantará.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">History of IBM: since the cortadora of cheeses until space flights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The international business machines Corporation (IBM) was founded in New York one hundred years ago, still its original name computing tabulating recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The name IBM is adopted in the year since 1924 - originally, this was a brand used in branches of Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The basis that resulted in the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four businesses dating back to the Decade of 1880.</seg>
<seg id="50">Owned inventions like the famous "clock and out," which allows control the entry and exit of employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint fichó the head of a company competition, Thomas J. Watson, to assist with the management of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson remain the strong foundation on which sustains the culture and identity of corporate).</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the business until the year 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of appliances for business, since meat cutters and cheese until boxes cash registers.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years since Watson led the company, the turnover doubled in $9 million and began the great expansion of the company by continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so crucial to the company, almost forty years after occupy the Chair of the head, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language programming.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s and the personal computers of IBM helped NASA to guide flights to space (to mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM system / 360.</seg>
<seg id="61">Classics "pecés," which established the standard computers of the time, arrived on the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years after, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which for its part, became part of the consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and started to offer a comprehensive advice and services of high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy that has paid IBM these past three years is the smarter planet concept, i.e. "a smarter planet."</seg>
<seg id="64">Its goal is to make more rational use of technology, while not yet planned areas, nor has it improved the circumstances, for example, with regard to transport and the administration of cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">For the commercial sector, IBM introduced not long ago the platform "smart commerce" that enables retailers to manage the business cycle complete.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a long history in this country.</seg>
<seg id="67">Already in 1932 opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country that took in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here today, IBM ČR operates in addition the centre of strategic outsourcing in Brno.</seg>
<seg id="69">Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Here too there is a research team that works with the world-famous voice recognition.</seg>

<seg id="6">Does that purchased at least a week in trapito?</seg>
<seg id="7">Does likes buying often in rebates?</seg>
<seg id="8">Then in his case it may mean that shopping has become a vice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Some women are realising that should appease his passion for shopping, at least a little.</seg>
<seg id="10">But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more by the clothes shops, seek clothing well adjusted and after probárselas all in the probador (ideally in all different colours)?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although to most women go shopping as a pastime, for men may turn in a virtual hell.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only remember how many times already told their partner they better hope the doorway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The constant dissatisfaction</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"so I am not too fat?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"would need to lose weight at least five kilos - should start to exercise?"</seg>
<seg id="16">'really you happy? "</seg>
<seg id="17">Do you ring these phrases?</seg>
<seg id="18">Do that, yes?</seg>
<seg id="19">Then is one of these women obsessed by their looks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listen to their partner complain all the time of your physical aspect.</seg>
<seg id="21">The strong sex also agrees that the more it increases the frequency of complaints, more intrusive become women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The order and cleanliness first</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Is like a merry-go-round infinite.</seg>
<seg id="24">Clean the windows, turn the vacuum cleaner, fregar soil, dust-off, fregar the bath and all this at least twice a week.</seg>
<seg id="25">Does he accuses his partner that he has applied the clean soil with a foot foul, their children who have daubed a washbasin newly cleared and a shelf with glass doors that both struggled cleanse?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">If you suffer this "deviation ," proved to be mindful that anything we should exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness surely not occupy should be paramount in the family.</seg>
<seg id="27">This desire harmless cleaning could threaten its relations and family welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Make comments disagreeable</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"The calzoncillos used are left with the clothes dirty."</seg>
<seg id="30">"you want to get these socks morning also used"</seg>
<seg id="31">'The damp rag was not left in the soil! "</seg>
<seg id="32">If ago such comments to their partner more times a day, to know that they will take it out of their boxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Of course. You don't want to say anything bad, only wants to ensure that everything is in order.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for its part, would not make so many comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Calumny and gossip</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">To some women will also slanderous statements, the gossip, but also insults and conspiracy against someone.</seg>
<seg id="37">Women are concentrated in relationships, so I like to speak of things boards of the sort who, where, with whom, how and why.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">To what is best in each of us sometimes have escaped you a small and harmless chisme.</seg>
<seg id="39">With hand on heart, that is itself almost all women.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the other hand, there are women chismosas of those that are not controlled, those who love chismorrear and do often despise all and are dangerous for the surrounding, especially a team in female labour.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How have evolved prices travel since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 had in Czechoslovakia then only five travel agencies State authorized: čedok, sporturist, ckm, rekrea and autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies then sold in most cases only travel the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Tourists Czechs were therefore holiday beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when we could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime was inclined towards the West and travel of tourists Czechs were then quite restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the checoeslovacos) not they were allowed to travel free and individually by even the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, Poland and the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the trip individual was not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agencies offered in those days also travel to the West, but one should be put to the tail with a Sleeping bag and spend the entire night, or take "well known " in the Agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">Still not everything was won.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called 'promise of change " that was the condition for travel to the West, was not extended to the "people politically unreliable ," that they could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, and without a guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain resources currency (the West) to travel to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The great majority of Czechs spend their holidays in their own country, so we had a great number of huts and houses summer, that the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Mode of travel of the Czechs has suffered since 1989 a real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While until 1989 to us was not going the more holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million trips on holiday to countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">NNA great paradox is that today we are no longer aware of, the fact that the destination currently favourite, Croatia, it was not until 1989 that he could travel freely, because it formed part of the then Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the early 1990s was imposed the visa exemption for travel to neighbouring States of Western Europe, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The checoeslovacos long unseen tired of the excursions to the West, the whole world wanted to see at least for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris sleeping groups of Czechs in parks in tents, as our revenue then we were not allowed to pay a hotel or pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was the carry with them the meal (tinned, sausages, etc.) to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely currency West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and increased with him also wages means, what about 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With rising demand for travel began agencies, beginning in 1997 with regularity, to prepare travel using connections charter flights, which made incredibly lower prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the late 90 of the last century, the Czechs already travelled visa-free to almost all developed countries, except us, which streamlined further our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario already happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and went to Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since that year, assume all the years direct charter transfer flights with Czech tourists was distant countries and hot. This winter is already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 destinations exotic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Countries exotic the visiting Czechs currently around 100 thousand per year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our development pos-revolucionario, came in the year 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On 17 November 2008, the US lifted visas for Czech tourists, with what our country has become among the most developed countries of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in its history, had spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3 per cent) and for the first time in their history, have been spent in travel abroad more than 15 thousand CZK per head, including the costs in the site visit.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Convened regular General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again in deadlock.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For almost five months without Czech football is President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek once as President of the Czech Football Federation (fačr), will not be known or after the convening of the forthcoming extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, still not come to an agreement on the voting rules to follow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without the same, will not be voting even to choose between the three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stakeholders to chair the Czech football are jindřich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomáš paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hašek once resigned his post in June but not before convening to his colleagues with the purpose of finding a strong person that knew deal of football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, after concluding the Hašek once was, it triggered a dispute between the two federations of the Association unable to reach agreement, to choose a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was evidenced on 16 September when he had to be elected the new President.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the neighbourhood of praguense smíchov, because talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">No consensus was reached, nor on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or delegates also with full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">From that moment and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also backed by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whereby the representation by full powers is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, disputes about the Electoral Code remain open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">More light on the situation no longer could shed or the Executive Committee that, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the focal point remains the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Svoboda Dušan, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the fačr, which, from the direction of the Association, represents professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate with the largest percentage of support in the Federation which will present its candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Moravia region is ready to reach a compromise so that the candidate can win with a greater percentage of total votes in both federations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part Bohemian, however, imposed the condition that the winner, according to these calculations percentage, should have the majority of at least two thirds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"It would, however, the connection to the two previous rounds and completely negate the concept of a bicameral system," This is how Svoboda understand the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best to not touch the order and vote according to the statutes governing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With what was said, surprisingly, agrees also tomaš paclík, although it was assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates should be more to pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I would like to put to the vote the maximum of agreement with the statutes. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"not to invent any nonsense about representatives as at the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as candidate and that directs their observations mainly against pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him, in nymburk be decided on the new President and he believes that the candidates in the future cooperate constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">"All the passions are apaciguarán with the party today of our national team at the European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">"soccer will again be a player, and thus cooperate more to taste" affirms the representative of jablonice, that of the three candidates have more experience in management of football, both at the Professional level and regionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is the more reluctant.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope that agreement can be reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is not a matter of conflict between bohemios and Moravians, but there are attempts to bend the rules to their own convenience."</seg>
<seg id="31">"This may result in a renewed blockade of the General Assembly. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"anyway, I hope that it will impose common sense," said rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">No longer have much time for all parties to reach agreement.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations had to be undertaken in Montenegro, but who can know until he begins the party if the football team is complete?</seg>
<seg id="35">The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and rajchl, has not escaped this morning by technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transporting a part of the Executive Committee will take place at the scene where the party of classification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Quizas the decisive meeting, finally, might be the one to be held at ministerial level, which allegedly was held this Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">To Josef dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would like very much mainstream parties split on the organisation of sport's most powerful country to reach agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">Much is at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (čstv) that will try to give a new direction to sport Czech after financial problems of home lotteries sazka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík will strive to reach the Presidency, because there is a most suitable candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, tomaš paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate that would satisfy all their ideas on the new President of the Czech Football Federation (fačr), nor would be submitted as a candidate for a post so relevant.</seg>
<seg id="41">"if it had a proper person, would be fighting for it and I would not be a candidate in the elections."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But until today has not been able to find such a person," said paclík to the news agency the Czech (čtk) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">What motivates paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav pelta and Henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking a pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, that opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (fačr).</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also said that, in the event win, would remain in office for President only until 2013, when would the hour of the regular General Assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In that post he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too associated with football events.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I have already spoken to some people that could take into account."</seg>
<seg id="47">"for me it was crazy to hear some say that at this time, not even want to identify with football Czech."</seg>
<seg id="48">"I would like to change that vision," adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What supposedly more annoying to paclík at this point is the relationship of pelta with the President of the Football Association Pilsen Regional Roman berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the mundillo as a powerful lobista with capacity to influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="50">For paclík is just as unacceptable to see pelta sitting in the presidential chair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"in case of who wins, would retain the current status and nothing will change in football."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with the support of berbra, an ambitious businessman, football even fewer will benefit," said paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of pelta was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which pelta left unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what prestige football could bring victory of pelta."</seg>
<seg id="55">"and we will look at you with eyes what UEFA and FIFA," said paclík, which also takes certain caution with his earlier statement that "it would sell the club if Pilsen pelta becomes President."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the case of winning elections Thursday, paclík could consider cooperation with pelta in the future.</seg>
<seg id="57">Of the same opinion is another candidate, rajchl, which has been supported by paclík before the General Assembly September that ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (pelta) would be the first to follow."</seg>
<seg id="59">"is very capable."</seg>
<seg id="60">"I could imagine, for example, as Chief of the representation."</seg>
<seg id="61">"but not as manager of a partnership. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"I also go the nose where I do not feel able," added paclík, which in September raised much attention by supporting a suspension of the Commission chaired by arbitrators ludek macel, replaced after by Dagmar damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík admits that dare to manage the partnership.</seg>
<seg id="64">Resorts to their management capacities of private companies, because in the summer is also the Director of Pilsen, that with your support held in May triumph in the first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its practice safe."</seg>
<seg id="66">"to reduce the influence of certain pressure groups, which probably tend to influence decisions of the Disciplinary Committee and appeals, causing unpleasant situations, said paclík without hiding their antipatías towards President of Sparta Daniel křetínský.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">One of the priorities also would be to consolidate the relationship between the fačr and Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which exerts pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of taxes lottery.</seg>
<seg id="68">"is one of the key problems to which we should devote the new President."</seg>
<seg id="69">"whether to increase taxes on gambling, as advertised political parties, would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where it is going to stop all this money," says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">In addition, paclík now does not even take account of its association with the club pilsner, even though he claims that the Chairman of the fačr must be "not in favour."</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is in turn associated with and jablonec rajchl with dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">"But I see no sense in fact yield hypocritically my actions Club Pilsen to another person then to return there after a year and a half," said paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised the fačr new statutes that would wipe out the deadlock of the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav pelt, promised that, if elected, would ensure that the fačr had new statutes that serve to solve definitively, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral regulations.</seg>
<seg id="76">The representative of jablonec is optimistic the meeting this Thursday in nymburk, and believes that conflict pre-election could move towards a settlement today with the possible victory for the football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Already before the elections not conducted in September, pelta focus promised, if elected, precisely in the representation and in fund-raising.</seg>
<seg id="78">Decided to participate in the last minute at the last General Assembly, so that this postponement of two months I could go either to defend and to submit, in a broader context, its ideas on the management of football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People of all levels are running the football a long time ago and expects to learn this Thursday the new President."</seg>
<seg id="80">"feel that the time has come for someone manage the partnership," thinks the man who is mainly associated with the club jablonice, but who worked in the Sparta and in the Executive Committee of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id="81">For this reason, believed have enough experience to manage football Czech.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that existed in the time of Ivan Hašek once.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly June were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."</seg>
<seg id="84">"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a President since September," warned pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the civic association was used as decoys to win over delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I am elected President, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond if this fails."</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist," says pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Moreover, in theory, no attempt to meddle with his opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">Already in the past had warned that it was working with Henry rajchl, to which respects by her training in law, mindful that his opponent would be further its first Vice-President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">Already time-consuming without attacking Thomas paclík who, unlike pelta, not left with puppet head.</seg>
<seg id="91">"takes more than a year in the football World, and has already achieved some successes. "</seg>
<seg id="92">"their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"That is why many of them have doubts about its true nature," said her opponent, pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from competitions until the lowest higher.</seg>
<seg id="95">The latter should be a showcase of promotion of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"also, try to resolve all of the scandals that arose owing to the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year. '</seg>
<seg id="97">"immediately after I involucraría in negotiations with the public and the private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for everything the football," he said two months ago to the čtk the candidate of 46 years.</seg>
</p>

</p>	
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that predict before the next General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will travel not in vain this Thursday at nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="101">"if the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, surely we will succeed in overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="102">"football needs credibility, which is set to recover only if finally has a leader," still two days before the day more decisive in his career of representative, pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that under his leadership the fačr would have to work with appetite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If in the fourth General Assembly elected the current Vice-President Jindrich rajchl as new President of the Association of Czech football, many people would be surely embittered.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">Wants to implement a systematic change and make the Executive Committee Member responsible for each area of football individually.</seg>
<seg id="107">Also undertakes to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, more money for football and continue with the work begun by the previous President Ivan Hašek once.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"as President, I would like to devote myself fully to the football."</seg>
<seg id="109">"since international contacts with UEFA and FIFA until the selection, through professional football or the training of young footballers high-performance. "</seg>
<seg id="110">"With this I do not mean to make him all alone," said rajchl in an interview for the čtk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and I would like to divide the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member could be devoted to a specified area. "</seg>
<seg id="112">"and I will give difficult tasks for that football can in each of these segments, continue forward with great momentum."</seg>
<seg id="113">"a lot of people that probably would not be happy, because it will mean start to work very hard and not only criticise the labour of others ," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement football, is said to have considered the possibility not to stand again as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="115">"all know, that working 20 hours a day. "</seg>
<seg id="116">"But I know that this makes sense and which will not have my people behind me that will prevent and hinder to each step," explained the reasons for his indecision.</seg>
<seg id="117">"many people told me that I must not give up, because then they would also vanquished by others. "</seg>
<seg id="118">"It is about having faith for not abandoning so, without more," said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">They say, also motivates him to continue the work already started with Hašek once.</seg>
<seg id="120">"during those two years, completed a lot of the work that I do not want now to be lost."</seg>
<seg id="121">"there are processes that had been started and which will have its effect within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop," announced concerned that, if elected to another candidate, Miroslav pelta, the situation in the association might return to be as it was before the era of Hašek once.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek pelta is not capable of maintaining.</seg>
<seg id="123">"behind him is especially all those people who would deal of football to be a privilege only to a select few."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone. "</seg>
<seg id="125">"attempt to be objective. "</seg>
<seg id="126">"I want to make a football for all, because only thus will feel well all and not only those elected," said rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">Also rejects the idea that only serious bohemio the President.</seg>
<seg id="128">"Although some people try to pretend otherwise, I have in mind to do the utmost to Moravia."</seg>
<seg id="129">"for example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division at a party in another Czech and Moravian, whose winners will go to the First Division."</seg>
<seg id="130">"would not be the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for players Moravians young," said rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Although the quarrel of the presidential elections joined tomaš paclík, President of the club, pilsner, rajchl stops believing in his chances of being elected.</seg>
<seg id="132">"still am having strong support of the Czech Federation, which I chose as his Vice-President and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said rajchl, whose successes include the saving of tens of millions of kroner contracts disadvantageous, the negotiations of TV contracts and negotiations on the lottery Act.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, acknowledges his part of the blame for the Russian is not united.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">And while that proclaims pelta is "disempowered to regain confidence in the Czech football," considers to another rival, paclík, a strong candidate which itself has something to offer to football.</seg>
<seg id="135">"nobody can deny that did a great job by the Pilsen that year."</seg>
<seg id="136">"In the case that will be elected, probably will follow what already started Ivan Hašek once and no exchange-rate significantly the personnel establishment in the committees. '</seg>
<seg id="137">"I do not want to use that in my favour," demonstrates to their rivals rajchl.</seg>

<seg id="5">A book shows where is the best welfare in the water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris meder conducted a journey of research during the past year and a half, there was something that could not fail in their luggage, a bañador.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tumbada backs on water, looked on the artistic dome on top, nadaba towards the angelotes marble, that the standing on the edge of the swimming pool and be asombraba before the swimming pool cover modernist meticulously restored.</seg>
<seg id="8">He liked the bathroom, took note in his Notebook at the time of all the interesting details on the style and history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The architectural historian meder explored more than 200 pools this way and the presents in his recent book "badefreuden": swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the "construction of concrete" in Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Conducted his "journey through the baths more extraordinary of central Europe " by 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, places visited Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">This German 46 years is a true enthusiast of the culture of the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wants nothing to do with sport, meder said, only water is different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just annoys him that bath fans have to settle with Blue tiles and stench of chlorine, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of the spruce forests or hear the cheerful trinos of the birds in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"one day I wondered why swimming pools they always have to be so ugly," says this inhabitant of Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I started collecting pools fine."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The water surface doubles the architecture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The chapoteo in the swimming pool and the airy oils of the sauna. The factor of well-being in swimming pools is so great because it addressed all respects, as meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And whether the Builder is endeavouring, swimming pools covered can be a real gift for the hearing: "instead of soil, in the baths it has a surface of water. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"by a Party is transparent, furthermore, reflects the beauty of the whole building."</seg>
<seg id="20">Around bends optically: the soaring vaults, tiles of colours, the launch pads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The book with photographs in small format "badefreuden" provides in 190 pages data very interesting about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mostly, one might be tempted to jump at the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Meder, the Collector of pools discovers the prominent copies in its investigations in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths as the bath Széchenyi Budapest, 100 years, are the waters by nitrates in a unique cavity kárstica (bathrooms in cavidades in miskolc-tapolca), as well as a few themes, whose swimming pools of water are alkaline and are in a building with a bottle (városi termálfürdö in jászberény).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular view: while the whole city puts the eyes in the swimming pool techada of Zurich, you can look to arlberb, snow-covered, since the swimming pool outside a bath in St. Anton, and: in the bathroom there are Turkish a window from which you can observe the practice in the ski pistes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The design, perhaps, more extraordinary expected to customers in längenfeld: the cathedral water ötztal seems a ovni that has just landed in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Of three open source steam rises in winter, while substantive mountains ötztal up in the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At meder, the Collector of swimming pools, not him was invading the smell of chlorine in all swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the baths Árpád in békescsaba, Hungary, the plague on diesel is so strong that the people are believed to have arrived in a bathing health.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose légamo being driven to the skin to go into the swimming pool, an enjoyment of well-being in a special way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Iris meder is also disappointed in a place in their search of beautiful places for bathing, when she wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and baths sun in the bathroom Czech luhatschowitz, was found with a ground blocked.</seg>
<seg id="32">Bathing 1902 by architect Duan jurkovic was closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">When meder peeked through the windows of the building desmoronadas modernist red, white and yellow, saw the brush grow between the tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Decadence counters in a swimming pool in lovely Black Forest: the Palace SPA in ADB wildbald.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind; not only can you discover elements neorománicos times its construction in 1844, if not also an Arab Hall style of Alhambra, added in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since its diligent modernization in 1995, the Palace SPA bath is the favorite of the collector of pools, Iris meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="37">"has much merit merge different architectural styles in one unit fantastic," says meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a palace that immersion in the thermal baths apparently does not have much importance.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The flag moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Ingeborg wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A history of architecture, with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Expo Austrian Brussels 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now reopened as House exhibitions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Postgerra the architecture of modern love - forms clear, the halls of glass, the curves brave and new construction materials, the typical thinking about technical progress, for what, the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the Brussels Expo of 1958 is a suitable example and known.</seg>
<seg id="7">The pavilion schwanzer then won the Grand Prix of architecture by its light and floating construction steel and glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is deemed to present a landmark of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Made the architect so well known that it also built the flag of Austria on the next exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary tower four cylinders for the mbw more building adjacent aplanado in Munich, became internationally known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its flag, designed as a building for temporary exhibitions was lifted after the Expo in the Schweizer Garten alongside the station south of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and inside was inaugurated a museum of the 20th century, was called the "Casa 20."</seg>
<seg id="12">The building was adequate but lacked spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite this was used until the contemporary arts in Vienna was a new home.</seg>
<seg id="14">The building is empty since 2001 and lapses increasingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Currently, the architect Adolf krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "home 21" and would be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tuesday afternoon opened the Belvedere Museum, she belongs to the House, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Agnes husslein-arco, the new Director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere since 2007, achieved a new beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-arco, Doctorate in history of art with a considerable career, inter alia, patinadora artistic on ice in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and Founding Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Salzburg, conducted reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and set their use.</seg>
<seg id="19">To exception of contemporary art, presents the works of sculptor Fritz wotruba foundation of the NWEC, should have a cafeteria and a bookshop and also built an office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict control, low-budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because reformed appreciable secession of Joseph olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the contest, if not because he studied with schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him an "important place and immense," in which he saw "almost every weekend 'presentations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Knew the project and the problem of the building, who disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and easily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "a devorador energy," said krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">It changed the profile of windows in the facade of glass, were installed an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass and was replaced the glass ceiling by a special safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Bridges thermal and the steel beams were reinforced or remplazaron and roofs of asbestos were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements used for the new use, a panel of light declined between the House and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the pavilion schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">Remain exterior doors originals, spray-painted shades the House is in old mahogany and protected against oxidation.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is exactly as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all this with strict control by the Office of monuments and a low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"often had to find material that was good, cheap and also would like to the Office for the protection of monuments," says krischanitz and warns of a harsh soil in the cellar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressure, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.</seg>
<seg id="33">The flag "that wine Brussels" has been difficult, stated recently krischanitz, a typical "appearance accident in the history of the city."</seg>
<seg id="34">An architecture that is "always in the wrong place" and therefore wanted to "awakening the conscience properly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case the House 21 is not in the wrong place, happened a stroke of luck urban. The completely new and planned "neighbourhood of the central police station," with housing and offices, stands alongside the Schweizer Garten.</seg>
<seg id="36">And perhaps happen another stroke of luck: the House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary art Hall Berlin and, as are audible, negotiates with the city on a location neighbour in the Schweizer Garten.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Bank scandal of Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Bank more risky of Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then it slid from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now runs a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Sure that Axel Weber had not thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">After its spectacular departure of the Summit of the Federal Bank, in July was known that in 2013 would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: President of the Administrative Council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber is happy publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new-found strength and leaves fall comments kind on his future classmates.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The USB has achieved a revitalization."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am glad to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In September it was clear that everything would be totally different.</seg>
<seg id="11">A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all security systems of the Bank and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Oswald grübel, Director General of the USB, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The President of the Administrative Council of the flash drives are considered equally touched since then, and all asked: when arrives Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Was known that Weber will advise the Bank since February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And will take over the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the Bank reported on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This is hard for Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="17">Is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and Counsellor and has had an adaptation period probably necessary.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coup is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just returned to prove it deserves the title "bank of the greatest scandal of Europe" long.</seg>
<seg id="19">By a party, the USB is enormous, until recently, was the largest administrator of property world, and moreover, for years, is sliding from one scandal to the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, it saves once so proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The financial crisis began.</seg>
<seg id="22">The USB had a good reputation until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the administrator of property and discreet Swiss solid but also mañoso, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investments in banks.</seg>
<seg id="24">By a party, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on the other hand, thrived as investment bank in the League of the big banks of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This impressive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hans Geiger, the former banker and later Professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "before my students, I always qualified to the USB as a model of a good bank."</seg>
<seg id="28">" from the perspective of today, one wonders: how could it be wrong? "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Was in a big mistake.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the year 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong in the USB.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mid-year, Peter wuffli, Director-General, which until then was regarded as a banker brilliant and very intelligent, resigned unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="32">Few months later, it was suspected the reason.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment fund the Bank embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To shoulder this, the USB announced an injection of capital from no less than 13 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">For this found investors, of course, that some watched with disdain until shortly before: a State fund Asian and opaque and a Singapore State fund Arabic, so discreet that she had never heard his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This was just the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel ospel, Chairman of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second highest-paid Administrative Council of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, continued the catastrophe, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State.</seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank bought values problematic to the UBS by many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billions of francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which became copropietaria Bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Throughout Switzerland was suffering, it was stated that the dramatic was this for a small country, whether houses to banks so huge.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally the amount of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graphic).</seg>
<seg id="43">"We cannot go back to rescue the UBS," said Geiger, expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">To the first catastrophe joined the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">Few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and he was willing to hand over data of wealthy clients, which possibly had belied taxes with the help of bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, adopted a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement unwarranted profits of these businesses with compensation for payment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">With this, the UBS confessed more or less have helped in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="48">Simultaneously lost something that had always been since its capital in competition for customers rich: the HALO of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal, the secrecy of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board and the President of the Administrative Council.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the outflow of funds from clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">In this way, within a few months, the Bank lost its credibility in its two central areas: in investment banking through the erroneous speculation and in the administration of property through aid tax fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And fair when I was back a bit calmer, just when it was thought that the UBS returned to achieve this, is this wretched history of the operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the Bank would realize that something was going wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And was unveiled, apparently, this still does not work well with the risk management in investment banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"with the case Adoboli is expressed that controls risk have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Professor of Economics and Finance at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial director of a large German Bank is also safe: "The problem of the UBS is not that dominates controls risk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">So arose the idea of caution, with the Swiss that bankers were long, be the guardians of the greatest assets of the world: no risk too big, in contrast, the security of money want to break across the Alpine Republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">Deposits security of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindh and sprüngli chocolate genuine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The Central of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of solid Swiss private bank, is only a little higher.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its main headquarters in street bahnhofstraße Zurich, that runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the summits of snow covered mountains Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="62">Here buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Here are jewellery stores as Tiffany's between traditional Swiss business as confectionery sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">Here lie for years Swiss banks: since the National Bank, via the Palace of Credit Suisse, until the elitarios private banks as Julius bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">It enters the room reception of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Within the walls are coated with marble, before there are large sillones leather, alongside the logo of the Bank there is a large sign to indicate "security ."</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer seeks here: security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some time have shifted the idea of the great Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as does the President of a small private Swiss bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">Prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after conducting ago, as all bankers Swiss, also with the business of both big banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS has become too big, thinks, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.</seg>
<seg id="71">That the Swiss had nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"and have grown accustomed long to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">In fact, changed the UBS investment banking Anglo-Saxon, delivered its first big gain and then came the disaster, no entity European financial had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as the big Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.</seg>
<seg id="75">"This Wednesday, the coalition Government of the tiny country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," The author writes Lukas hässig in his book "Der ubs-crash" ("the crash of the UBS " in Spanish).</seg>
<seg id="76">Politicians granted until 68 billions of francs or approximately 45 billions of euros to save the great bank of bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How it happens?</seg>
<seg id="78">Speaks with Swiss Bankers, so see the problem in the dimension of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks are merged in a powerful syndicate.</seg>
<seg id="80">Arises a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the little Switzerland, and continues to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">By what served to which the two different banks precursors of the UBS qualify: a Bank rich but sleeping with the Centre for the administration of property in Zurich and internationalization poorest but stronger.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, investment banks internationalized arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could make a large bicycle taxi financial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">There are two names associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter wuffli, head of the consortium of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel ospel, then President of the Administrative Council.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that wuffli and ospel were a perfect team," said the banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"wuffli, the intellectual, modest, understands that a lot of models and statistics, and ospel, the intuitive that managed to muddle since learning in the Bank until the Summit. "</seg>
<seg id="86">Finally, ospel was fió of wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And eventually wuffli probably committed a decisive error: "thought that their models were a reality," said Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"It is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">Is clear: the blunder came before the event.</seg>
<seg id="91">Employees of the UBS remember clearly meetings managers, which wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same theme: down from the Throne to Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American Bank was the Investment Bank's most powerful world.</seg>
<seg id="93">Topped the "league tables," the classifications that then documented the success of banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">The UBS wanted to be in the Summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps left him well.</seg>
<seg id="96">In operations of foreign currency and in the negotiating action was highest.</seg>
<seg id="97">However, advisers responsible businesses highlighted a weakness: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income," there is a huge compensation for major banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS has holes in the American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Avid growth, invested both the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in American investment high-risk.</seg>
<seg id="101">Was transformed into a powerful machine for titularizar American mortgage loans and selling them below, maintaining certain risks on their own account.</seg>
<seg id="102">And also, as other banks sought the drop long.</seg>
<seg id="103">"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">So great euphoria, so deep the fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager had to leave, because the attempt of ordering proved more complicated than they expected.</seg>
<seg id="106">Posts in the UBS became seats proyectables and are insecure until the present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Currently, who leads a large bank, has an almost impossible job.</seg>
<seg id="108">Must find a strategy for a bank, before which all the business models are logical lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea, ending in investment banking, to focus on the administration of property, returning to the roots of the Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Bank does not want to go that far (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">But investment banking should diminish much, is currently unclear.</seg>
<seg id="112">The following Thursday, Sergio ermotti, the Bank's new President, will present his future strategy the world.</seg>
<seg id="113">In reality, are only thought in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a temporary solution, since the bank the Bank was severed surprisingly his predecessor grübel.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, he imposed himself: should direct permanently business of UBS, the Bank reported in Zurich on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its State in the mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">Deletes 3,500 posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But this is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is?</seg>
<seg id="120">With what you want to win money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that insurance is ago Axel Weber currently.</seg>
<seg id="122">So far only said that first seek a shelter with his wife in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The following year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The intense and generous new book by Peter englund, the beauty and the sorrow of the battle (the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history about the first world war, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can do that one, he drops the soul to the feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Here are some tips for action: grubbing-up it mildly this page and make it in their brand pages.</seg>
<seg id="4">Will come to know very well these people in storytelling novelística of Mr englund, and this dramatis personae will operate as his GPS, a beacon for those few moments in which, as one of its men and women, is confusing and destitute in the fog of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Mr englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">Is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">What he has written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "a work of anti-historia."</seg>
<seg id="8">Contains some names notable, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.</seg>
<seg id="9">Is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humour."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"The beauty and the sorrow of the battle " combines the wartime experiences of more or less ordinary 20 men and women, on both sides of the war, since colegialas and botanical to escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people will become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some will become prisoners of war, or will lose their members, will become madmen or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives here as votivas parpadean candles burning in a church; new ones are added to the mixture while others shouting dies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book of Mr englund is a deviation from the standard history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">Is also a corrective to the notion that the first world war was only the deadly trench warfare on the western front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The beauty and the sorrow of the battle " moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soldiers in this book them fall over hives; one gets the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is a touching book, almost since the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="19">War fills the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that reeks cordita.</seg>
<seg id="20">When artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you or quedas huyes?</seg>
<seg id="21">Anyway who next?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost nobody understands what is happening, or even why he has to fight this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Lack of facts ," notes Mr englund," has been filled with speculation, surmise, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty and the sorrow of the battle" remains to individuals as Florence farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories have been achieved mostly of memoirs, letters and other material already published previously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Explanations of their lives can be terrifying or moving, but they are more alive in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, Mr englund.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of these are about deprivation and make do with what we have.</seg>
<seg id="28">About tell the story of a German colegiala said: "substitutes on all parties substitutes."</seg>
<seg id="29">"ersatz coffee, aluminium false, Goma imitation, dressings of role, buttons of wood."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Continues talking about the meal substitute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">Describes " meat made from rice cooked in fat and squeezing Carnero (and topped off with a bone false fact wood); tobacco fact roots and peladuras of potatoes dry; shoes with wooden soles. "</seg>
<seg id="32">There is, observes, "837 substitutes permitted the production of meat in sausages, 511 substitutes coffee registered."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are about honour and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognizes its own momentum towards the savagery and expressed about the war: "sientes that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in with a sillones cigarro and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretending that veneer and civilisation mean that there is not a barbaric behind that pechera almidonada and tachonada."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Instead a British soldier realises that probably will die, and that nobody will notice or it would import.</seg>
<seg id="36">"once one resign itself to thinking of sacrifice, one would like to think that could happen before the public," writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">In contrast, is horribly similar "to a convict being strangled in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr englund, "a war between factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">Reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiario of the young century: the murderer mass eloquent and convinced ideologically with clothing of good tailoring that executes its carnage while is sitting behind a desk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr englund spoke of soldiers who actively tried to catch a disease venérea of prostitutes as jettisoning the service at the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The more grotesque expression of this can be seen trade of European gonocócico, that soldiers buy embadurnan and with it his genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital," writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"those who are truly desperate as frotan on their eyes, which often leads to a blindness for life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter serious, the prose of Mr englund agile but not flamboyant, is perfectly suited to his task human.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to 'unleashed forces exceptionally uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred ."</seg>
<seg id="47">The people begin to question why their leaders are doing them combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, as the Great War and modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as without novelty in the face of Erich Maria remarque, instead of comprehensive histories.</seg>
<seg id="49">The volume of Mr englund joins a Pantheon unconventional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book is one of the most devastating end that I can recall in a work of fiction not.</seg>
<seg id="51">'t revelaré.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if it had come from his book, uprooted between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned with a match.</seg>

<seg id="1">After a faux pas prior, an assault planned to the minute</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Was chosen the night of Monday to Tuesday because the Zuccotti Park would be more vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="4">The operation was kept secret except for a few senior officers, saying initially that others were joining an exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the centre, its presence underlined how the operation was plagaba of challenges to the Police Department.</seg>
<seg id="6">Could not be repeated episodes of recent weeks, as the PEPPER spraying espray on demonstrators, contravening standards of the Department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards' okupas. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And therefore the police operation to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.</seg>
<seg id="8">Agents had been drafted, seeing as it had developed occupations in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="9">A mock greater catastrophe was taking place at randalls island, with one eye looking toward Zuccotti.</seg>
<seg id="10">Agents increased the so-called training of disorder - counter-terrorism measures that involve mobilize quickly to a large number of police officers - to focus on the lower Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The last meeting of training was on the evening of Monday, on the Manhattan side of the East River.</seg>
<seg id="12">Orders to enter the park arrived at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Polis' to the few who know that they were called for this, not told them that was to enter Zuccotti Park, "said the person, who spoke anonymously.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The only people who knew they were about to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the Department."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned from the city.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 14 October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but desistieron when hundreds of protesters emerged soon after hearing about the plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The operation of Tuesday, involved agents from several police units, including special forces throughout the Borough - dozens of mobile that officers routinely used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Mr Kelly said that many people, like those who commute daily to work, had been back and forth of the Park during the day, making the 1 a.m. a good time to enter.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It was appropriate to do so, when it would be the lowest number of people in the park," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Trucks unity of emergency services with pockets and loudspeakers congregated at the junction of Pike slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan bridge, before exiting.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lights and the messages from loudspeakers retumbaban pregrabados that seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="22">Community affairs officers were at the park with their blue cortavientos clear, many protesters simply collected their things and left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Not hit any shop until 1: 45 a.m., said the police, giving time for the protesters to gather their belongings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other teams of officers were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Journalists in the park were forced to leave.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman of the Police Department, said that it was for their safety.</seg>
<seg id="27">But many journalists said they tried to avoid that saw the police enter action in the park, and that they had been treated rudely by agents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Browne said that units mobile television in church Street, along the western edge of the Park, could capture images.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As the police moved westward through the dense thicket of personal effects of demonstrators, including luggage and bags of trash for paper and plastic packed clothes, teams of Department of cleaning followed them, picking up what was left behind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Some demonstrators refused to move were dragged outside, appearing images on the Internet soon after.</seg>
<seg id="31">A core group of protesters took up positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the centre of the park.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Around 10 people in the epicentre of the camp are candaron between them by the arms.</seg>
<seg id="34">And two persons were encadenaron to trees, said Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Officers of the emergency service were called to cut the locked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Were not made arrests in the park until more or less the 3: 30 a.m., said Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="37">The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, the police said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Mr Browne said that approximately 142 people were arrested in the park.</seg>
<seg id="39">Most of the arrests were for "disturbing the public order and resistance to authority," he said.</seg>
<seg id="40">The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the Department, the senior uniformed officer in the Department.</seg>
<seg id="41">Phil T. pulaski, the Chief of detectives of the Department, was also there.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Kelly, while he was present, "was not directing operations," said Mr Browne.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">A second group of actors expected along the east side of Broadway, between cedar and liberty streets, in case they had to enter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Rose up barricades in the cortlandt street, a block north of the park, and at the pine street, a block to the South.</seg>
<seg id="45">Since these positions, was the police to expand the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.</seg>
<seg id="46">At a given time, a number of actors, many with shields, were seen pushing people outside.</seg>
<seg id="47">Had some 28 people in the northern perimeter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Any action more noisy of the night took place south of the park.</seg>
<seg id="49">Around 5 a.m., the southern pine street, a demonstrator jumped on the bonnet of a police car, and others were seen taking away the air of the wheels of a police van.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Workers Union support will take to the city by redundancies</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory due to its disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Demand is, perhaps, the last weapon available to the Union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to overturn the dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees that were among the worst paid the city lost her job on 7 October, in a move that Union leaders have described as a political revenge for his refusal to allow the spring, the access by the city to fund a healthcare by working groups to close its budget gap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing in City Hall last month, the Counselor education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Council member contraatacó saying that nothing in the budget specified that members of the support staff of the school would be redundant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Staff of the municipal district 37 said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that would be sued. There will be a press conference Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the claim, in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight redundant workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Hispanic women, like most of the workers who lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by the New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, since that had been insufficiently subsidized form of chronic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Indicates that while there were no redundancies at Staten Island and few layoffs in schools on the upper east side or tribeca, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit said, "this is not a neighbourhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P.D. the budget district 36 fell in a 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrolment by poor in schools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The syndicate also says that directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum that authorized the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memorandum used the word 'surplus' to describe the action, despite that "surplus" describes more often the act of transferring a master of the rolls of a school to a labour exchange, whose salaries are paid by the central office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"sixty-six coordinators parents were laid off," said the draft of the complaint, "and not only in surplus ."</seg>

<seg id="1">Liquidated mission, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Seems finally Republicans and Democrats at the Capitol are ready to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everything that was required was that the rebellion would succeed, that the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the involvement of United States came to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate is to consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (democrat of Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and troops of America for its "courage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is to honour the brave people of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may seem harmless, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, lawmakers from both parties fought among themselves and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain offered a resolution that authorizes the limited use of US military forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and that never came to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">Things left the mission of us in a kind of purgatory legislative - with Congress sufficiently irritated as to criticise the handling by Obama of the Mission, but not as angry as for actually extinguishing the grass under their feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Below, the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on 20 October.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO Mission officially ended on 31 October.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now the Senate could be ready to act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for his tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to extricate themselves" and "pays tribute to the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its partners in the coalition that took part in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary bravery and professionalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Does win the new measure the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will divide lawmakers as did the bill June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The final version was rejected by Senator Richard G. place (Indiana), the leading Republican of the Committee.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spokesman for the venue said on Monday that it had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressmen, Republicans and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually achieves a vote of the whole House in the House or the Senate in this Congress.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other lawmakers have been unsuccessful so far to bring their amendments to the Assembly, but not for lack of trying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a broad range of topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are duplicates - the same draft law proposed in both the House and the Senate - and some with slight variations among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are at least 15 versions of the amendment in the budget balance alone in the House, and another handful that "control the federal spending."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of those bills are also identical between themselves, but they give their sponsors - mainly Republican freshmen who seek to refine their curricula vitae - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors " of such a measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required that both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea that amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several States want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, whereas the Representative José E. Serrano, democrat of New York), wants to remove the two-term limit on Presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat from Illinois has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">An amendment prohibiting gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning flags.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of whether federal laws are rejected by two thirds of States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So enthusiastic that have been members in proposing amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="36">111º in the Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and made 66 in the 110º.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The pace is unacceptable if compared with the 1990s, when members submitted regularly over 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But not had much more success then than we are now.</seg>
<seg id="39">The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by the Congress in 1789.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interview with giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special programme on "20 / 20" one-hour, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book The couple, "gabby: a story of courage and hope."</seg>

<seg id="16">"We are not suffering at all," said Brigadier General B. Sean MacFarland, who he commanded troops in Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan.</seg>

<seg id="1">The army faces growing pressure to eliminate rape</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for its alleged passivity before the violation.</seg>
<seg id="3">If not, hundreds of plaintiffs were being organized for the following.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The soldier first Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she said that she was raped by a colleague.</seg>
<seg id="5">Was October 2008, and was on his way back to his barracks in the Miramar air base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he encountered a colleague carrying a package of 12 cans of beer.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked if he could join her in her room to make a cup.</seg>
<seg id="7">"sounded an alarm," said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the native of Texas aside his concern.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought, no, it is 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Is Texas," she says.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I wish I would have listened to my instincts. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Within minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man had approached him from behind, tirándola downwards and raping her, alleges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand that have filed against the exsecretario of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, he will go to trial.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lawsuit alleges that gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of widespread rape between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the implied demand initially to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom say they were raped or assaulted sexually by your colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or dispense proper justice after the alleged assaults.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke said that it will by the leadership of the army, because the problem begins with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The military is a top-down structure," she says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? the high command."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also said that since February, have been in touch with her nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands.</seg>
<seg id="20">Its strategy: instead of accumulating to all complainants in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The defence team for the Department of Defence, headed by the Federal Prosecutor Neil macbride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Tribunal documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed the defence strategy -- in essence, that the military can't be sued by current or former soldiers by injuries sustained in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">By a Supreme Court judgement of 1950 called the Feres doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for damage to personnel in active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the alleged damage are part of military service of the plaintiffs," say the documents.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Defence Department refused to comment for this article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">While women still being officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear the front lines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldier died and two thirds of them in combat situations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Is time that the army also is to modernise, said Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She is not alone in his struggle, and three other lawsuits are under way, in addition to yours.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Yale Law School's legal services clinic for veterans is preparing a case against the four major military academies by supposedly promote an environment misogynistic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder " allocated to rape victims in order to give them the high service - a common occurrence, according to activists, like Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in service, a human rights group.</seg>
<seg id="34">His group filed a suit in December against the administration of veterans, by accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way in which handles claims of benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Have been submitted nine bills separately in Congress by a mixture of bipartisan senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010 there were 3.158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the prevention of the sexual assault and response of the Department of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the assaults are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which figure in approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred that year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report, published in March, also examines rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that in the civil justice system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.</seg>
<seg id="41">That night, he says, he was asked to disclose the details of its breach 11 times different to a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">It was submitted to a kit of rape, and the blood of her attacker - A court in its brazo- was found in his bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about who had had sex with her boyfriend the day of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people declared themselves as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day that we read the verdict," said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought I was going to go to work, I found myself screaming from the room. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"I was in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember that I said to my official of command, "" this was not his view. That was my view. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, which eventually he was diagnosed with a personality disorder, which made her unsuitable for the service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010 was dispensed service under terms menos-que-honorables, what prevents him from receiving any benefit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, said John Turley, law professor at the George Washington Law School.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, said, "in my opinion, should be able to go ahead."</seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine which has been criticized since it was first published.</seg>
<seg id="53">I have been a critic of permanent the Feres doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that raises the responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">And adds: "The odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try."</seg>
<seg id="56">These things only change when the good people is prepared to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the hearing is not on his way, Burke, Attorney for the plaintiffs, will the tail to its hundreds of other plaintiffs to future cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We will continue to fight against the army in this matter until reform happen," says.</seg>
<seg id="59">"or until us muramos, what happens first.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: How investigators are studying in Facebook Te</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type that aireaba their viewpoints anti-inmigración online.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having made a massacre in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from being only in cyberspace: had spent most of the time that preceded his attack in front of her computer, around chatting with some of the millions of nationalist supporters, right-wing groups in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, investigators wanted to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how can you find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy - you've only to enter Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We realised that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on populism European digital by the British think-tank demos.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cache of personal information Facebook is so enciclopédico, said Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the tool of advertising to identify their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that the sellers have been using for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team Bartlett found half a million fans from right-wing groups across Europe, and then I flew announcements, but instead of vincularles to a new band or product of diet, the announcements they invited users to complete a survey that asked about their education level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about its own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To arrive via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 followers of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the Office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"is an altogether new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not entirely surprising: supporters online, right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, in a sort of swing, "those that combine their activism online activism with offline are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who are behind the screen of a computer."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The work of demos is only one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "likes," messages on the walls and updates of State.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users by adding an average of three pieces of content a day, the "supernova data" Facebook is creating a boom in the investigation, pushing the number of academic work with the name of the website in the title until almost 800% in the past five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that you can look at the people who you could not acercarte with a folder in the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"before, when intentabas encuestar to people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"you should go through the game, and you never allow them access," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook removes all of that - you go to them directly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address problems of salud-social.</seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, a University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, found that college students who spoke of their feats of borrachera on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having problems with the drink that students who remained silent on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suggested that colleagues of the students, such as counsellors residential, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of State with its borracheras.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose," said Dimitri Christakis, a co-author of Moreno and Director of the Center for Health, behaviour and development of the child in the Seattle children's research institute, told the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook is also constantly "pinchando" to its own population to obtain data.</seg>
<seg id="28">The team of data of the site has produced statistics on the State of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of turnout half-way through the legislative period of 2010, and an index of national happiness (mainly using information which can be accessed - defenders of liberty digital long ago who argue that the website should be put at the disposal of its other large amount of data for research).</seg>
<seg id="29">However, users of Facebook know that the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice by power to play scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site mine your personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what happens when users of Facebook become part of a survey that not even known?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free Bar for all.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not think that many users have thought even in the fact that an investigator could be considering their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist from the laboratory of knowledge of London, on a 2006 study that conducted with the public's Facebook walls of students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"as far as they are concerned, it was only between them and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic this being completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know which part of the information on a user profile, and the messages of the wall are truth.</seg>
<seg id="37">"what you say and what you do in Facebook outside of Facebook are two completely different things," said Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why, despite its years as an investigator of technology, Selwyn believes a sujetapapeles and a pen remain the best research tools that anyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to real people," she says.</seg>
<seg id="40">"social research was supposed to be on social terms - and a lot of social terms is still happening offline."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brains of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a combatant "resistance" during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="3">"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Caballeros templarios in the Norwegian," he said before a room packed with 500 people.</seg>

<seg id="6">Torkjel nesheim the judge interrupted to Breivik during the monologue, because "I did not want to Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their views."</seg>

<seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, barred from access to the media during four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control on all visits and correspondence during eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Around 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons of the lost interview of Steve Jobs, shown in a theater this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some that he contrasted with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genie of technology as the great inventor modern.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what the fans of apple could find more revealing, in an interview to jobs recently rediscovered that has been desempolvado as advancement of a series of special screenings in the biggest markets this week, is how much this meant creative mind on business processes and workflows working products.</seg>
<seg id="4">Was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but also was an organizer and a meticulous yonki of flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives were "a disease that is to think that a great idea is 90% of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of labour between a great idea and a great product."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob cringely was developing the television series the triumph of the nerds (the triumph of the idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time had passed barely 10 years since that jobs had been obliged to leave Apple, and already worked intensively in its new computer company next, awaiting adoption popular Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of the interview, cringely was used in nerds, said that the originals of the interview vanished during transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Was only after the death of jobs who was discovered in a complete copy VHS in the garage of the Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This archival material, slightly republished, is the basis of Steve Jobs: the lost interview, on 68 minutes, which arrives in cinemas this landmark Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone known for hate the in-depth interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and commercial strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And very very surprised.</seg>
<seg id="12">In four different locations throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, where jobs is clearly weighing their thoughts, looking for accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments in which the perfectionism of jobs coming to the surface, where it seems impatient due to questions of cringely, empujándole to go faster towards items or arguments of greater importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before the era of pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic lost in the interview, when jobs assesses what is that other companies are good and bad, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Is one thing to read evaluations posthumous career of jobs, but there is something crude and inspiring in the jobs that we see here, the dreamer eager to the brink of greatness.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of as can and things should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Not long after explain it all in detail here, it was and it did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of seven notable interview sequences of the lost:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">On how he learned to carry a business:</seg>
<seg id="20">"over the years in the business, I always wondered:" why you do things? "and responses that Te Dan of form are unchanged: 'Oh, this is just the way it goes."</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is what I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify the accounting of apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Disconcerted by the way in recorded costs - often starting with a "standard cost " that it was at eye of good cubero, and that is then covered with a" variable " - developed an automated factory which ensured that could determine the costs of trading to detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Joke on the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs narrated the "blue box " which he constructed with Steve Wozniak - A device that allowed people to hackear effectively the telephone company and make calls to long-distance free.</seg>
<seg id="27">Has written widely about the device, but the euphoria of jobs here to describe the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">Describes how he and Wozniak proved the Fund through the use of a public telephone, making a call, and then conectándose from a network of AT & T to another, while creating a loop with the largest number of satellites possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We were enveloping things around the world a half-dozen times and gritabas through the public telephone and came back a minute later to public telephone of next-door," says jobs with a risita.</seg>
<seg id="30">"were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves which could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">Us two, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could monitor a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that apple had ever existed without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost drop out, calling the Vatican through the blue box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, as did its best imitation of Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">As several Members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the Pope himself outside awakened to go to answer the telephone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On in love with the technology (and the sale by telephone with bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12, in the hunting of spare parts to build an accountant frequency, sought to bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and made him a call.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, jobs was a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"that was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what it was and how well a company that dealt with their employees."</seg>
<seg id="38">After jobs became in one of HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first computer table ever done."</seg>
<seg id="39">Was as great as a suitcase, had a small screen cathode tube, and me enamoré of him.</seg>
<seg id="40">Get a trip until HP as a teenager and would lose time with that machine and would write programs for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Improvise on innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">On several points in the interview, jobs spoke about inventing new products on the way.</seg>
<seg id="43">Early in his career, as was devoted to sell a handful of plates based, asked a client whether he could assemble the entire team.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working with only 30 days credit, had to find out the Assembly and delivery of finished devices.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, while he was at Apple, recalls struggles to those faced in the development of a computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember having arguments dramatic... I shouted that it would take five years [to create a mouse that cost $300], and me harté and I went away and I found a designer.</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days after, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was entirely reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On large companies losing strength:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before liderara the renaissance of Apple, jobs foresaw proféticamente the way in which many industry leaders they would have in their vision, and would lose control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">"di trabajas in which Xerox or IBM, which beams photocopiers and printers best, and what?"</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas cenan with the rival of the healthcare act while the court accepts the case</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to the Healthcare Act by President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers that will set out the case before the High Court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The occasion was last Thursday, when nine judges met in a preliminary hearing for carefully consider petitions for review.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases at issue was a lawsuit filed by 26 States challenging the total of healthcare reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists around the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Judges agreed to admit to act on the petition and, indeed, it looks a case of historic 5 and a half hours to March, and the result will probably enturbiará further the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the decision of the Tribunal is known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will appear before the Court and will claim that the law should be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the US during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, Bancroft pllc, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society, a group that has for many years devoted to the defence of the legal principles conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones day, representing a of trade associations who defied the law, the National Federation of independent business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held in a hotel in Washington, just hours after the preliminary hearing of the Court on the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Healthcare Act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Are the special guests at the dinner? scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the federalist society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And that is not something in conflict with the ethical standards.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of judges lower federal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Failure to do so could be said to fall under the Code Canon 4c, which reads: "a judge could attend events to raise funds of organizations connected with the Act and others, though the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the absolute proximity of scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to to alarm activists Ethics in Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the Code goes against the demands of several judges that abides by the Court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of common cause (common cause).</seg>
<seg id="19">"judges were agasajados in a fund-raising Gala with attorneys who have cases pending before the Court."</seg>
<seg id="20">Its emergence and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and it is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little appetite for the critics who say that mingled too easily the activity of the Tribunal with Agenda driven by groups such as the federalist society.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Moreover, Conservatives argue that is Judge Elena Kagan, which has an ethical issue, not scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan served as Solicitor General in the Obama administration when it submitted the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its critics have pressed for Kagan refrain from seeing the case, saying that she was too involved in defending the law and for now be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan has not given any indication that he will.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare them to help rescue the eurozone out of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that inhibit the growth of Asian economies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat NAG, the Director-General of the Asian Development Bank, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing large economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to speed up the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries who are watching Europe's difficulties in a manner "impartial " and stated that the financial assistance of Asia together with leadership and European resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are all in this together."</seg>
<seg id="6">"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful," she told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so if China and India can help, which is, by all means."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have rocketed dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that he might push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to join in helping the eurozone to find a solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mr NAG predicted that any support of Asia would go through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - as the purchase of bonds EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone since its own economy was now suffering plummeting exports and depletion of inflows of foreign capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"nobody wants the eurozone remains volatile and turbulent," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are monumental challenges and must maintain a high level of growth."</seg>
<seg id="16">"is not an option, it is an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility in helping rich Europeans when facing their own and deep economic problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ashutosh varshney, Professor of Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult sell aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people of India, of whom up to 800 million live with around $2 a day or less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"at some point they would realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and were going on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why reservations of India should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector in jobs for poorly managed companies, and generating losses as the railways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Mr NAG said that the eurozone crisis threatens to "significant knock-on effects" across Asia.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 is now facing the "downward risks " because of the threat of Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Serious Pentagon warnings about potential cuts in defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta, calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts looming could undermine national security and triggering a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to chains montage civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is already digested the 450 billion of cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that could be imminent if Congress cannot agree on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">Said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its result, the so-called "kidnapping ," would result in a 23 percent of overall reductions and a high for many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"a cut so great, this applied indiscriminately, make the most of our projects and naval construction not be implemented - can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Also we would be forced to turn away many of our civilian staff from unintentional and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the objective. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes romperían faith with those who maintain our army and seriously hurt readiness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Cuts eventually will reach into combat troops, said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Although financing for wartime in accounts overseas contingency operations were not directly affected by the abduction, the efforts of the war would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis," warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"recruitment of staff would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the staff on payroll is reduced, resulting in delays in payments to vendors in time of war, and the legal support and political would be interrupted."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline of the United States as a major military power in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are firmly against this action draconian," the senators said in a joint communiqué the afternoon of Monday, when they published the letter to Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is not an outcome with which we can live, and is certainly not one that we should impose upon us ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="17">"kidnapping is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to happen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the letter to Panetta, and the recent warnings of senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls for exonerating the Pentagon cuts is to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly vocal about the potential cuts, despite that came to a job at the top of Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that was facing difficult decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an Army with a shell, but not a core.</seg>
<seg id="21">"is a boat without sailors."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a squad without bullets."</seg>
<seg id="23">"is a wing air without sufficient pilots trained."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep abreast with potential adversaries."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Indeed, invites aggression..."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an appendix to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the reductions would "generate significant operational risks: delay in the response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our capacity to be deployed and committed previously worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk for future combat operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">That list includes the fighter f35 joint strike fighter, a new bomber planned, the submarine ballistic of new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new vehicle of battle on land that the army and the Navy need replacing, the Humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Stop the development and the additional evidence of the f35 could generate some 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but advocates say that it is the next vital step to improve and address the potential threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">A look at the headlines more recent shows us how serious and pervasive are the deception and lies in everyday life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accused the other of lying.</seg>
<seg id="4">Managers of the State-run University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports claiming that a football coach withdrawn was sexually assaulting children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with an open microphone saying the US president, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">Congressman for New York and exhibicionista in Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his disclaimers quickly rebatidos by irrefutable proof.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations in the campaign financing related to the cover-up of an extra-marital affair.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, again, nobody will ever forget what I lived the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton to lying during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Are wide-spread legends on cheating on tests of school and university.</seg>
<seg id="11">There had been cases in which teachers has given the answers to the exams for students in order to be better seen in their evaluations of performance.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mentors who teach should be otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much deception we find?</seg>
<seg id="14">In an ordinary day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.</seg>
<seg id="15">That sure, many of these lies are pious lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that unknown cheating three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Detect lies, or "location of lies ," a skill is essential that we should acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a game table similar to, for example, charade, where the objective is to say: "You have," the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on serious scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lie have been rebatidos.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Liars Yes look to the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Not always tartamudean, balbucean, was ruborizan or uneasy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Cannot be concluded either that the liars are difficult to detect or unmasked.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lie detector coached can reach the truth learning about the structure of the Declaration, the expressions microfaciales, the questions of training and the times.</seg>
<seg id="24">Spent several years sondeando scientific discoveries on deceit in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include the recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liars have the ability to read good for others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and felt intuitively how they perceive others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know from research that the extrovertidos lie more than the introvertidos, that men speak more "lies directed towards themselves," while women say more lies " geared towards others "-- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that people married lie less frequently to their partners that persons who are not married (but the lies that usually say tend to be" huge ").</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, the other will feel less guilty of the deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How do you know if someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, observe the usual behaviour of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is called "Creating a base line."</seg>
<seg id="31">Helps provide benchmarks for measuring after the changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Observe the position of the subject, Laughter and characteristic voice.</seg>
<seg id="33">Is better to know if someone normally golpetea with the foot all the time for not making accusations unfair when you see the feet golpeteando in half of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Below, find groups of misleading behaviour, verbal and non-verbal.</seg>
<seg id="35">Considers these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as evidence of deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Persons that fool can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember its history, can aim their feet towards the door, tilted towards an exit, change its stance significantly or exhibit a "relaxation postentrevista" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of stance once that all the difficult questions are finished.</seg>
<seg id="37">Often interrogators falsely imply that the interview had completed only to find that relief postentrevista.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also pays attention to the vocabulary of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">Scott Peterson got the leg up to the Fund and used the last time while he argued that his wife killed was alive, launching a search for it at a national level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Persons that fool can also use a language distanciador: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman... miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in full.</seg>
<seg id="41">Indicators verbal more common are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Someone can use a lot of "language restrictive" when answer a difficult question: "well... to tell the truth... until what I was... to my mind. "</seg>
<seg id="43">This makes the answer is a perception rather than a fact, and it is often a warning signal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to detect deception is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives.</seg>

<seg id="1">The controversial plan the pipeline diverted after the threat of delay us in their adoption</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enfureciendo to unions, while apaciguaba to environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline said that it is ready to redirect the project to return to encaminarlo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">TransCanada said on Monday night that move the pipeline planned outside the area of ecologically sensitive sandhills in Nebraska, and trusted that the draft will win approval.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The company announced the decision at a press conference in The Capitol of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="5">The steering of TransCanada, Alex pourbax, said that the company maintains its confidence that with time the pipeline will be adopted, albeit with a different route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until it study new potential routes that avoid areas of Nebraska sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of underground water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"This is a true path of progress," said the Representative Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible that besides any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and they expressed their full support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The pipeline would stretch 1,700 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="11">Would carry 700,000 barrels per day of the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this would require that cruzara six States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have capitalized on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from sandhills region and Ogallala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The environmental impact study current State Department found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the Inspector General of the Department has ordered an independent evidence of the revision process, focusing on two issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One is if the Member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was campaign Adviser for Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other is whether a firm that was contracted to conduct the study was an inappropriate because original choice was linked to TransCanada.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Adversity climate slowed down the economy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the first year of management Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and the informality, dropped foreign investment and the economy contracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-styled of change, which has generated great expectations of progress in the economy, but given the adversity climate start of the year, is not observed growth, instead, it shows a deterioration in the key indicators of economic development.</seg>
<seg id="4">Low temperatures February, besides causing billions in losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the State economy to grow, causing a contraction in economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16% in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the report of the impact by frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, took damage in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of whom the 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 2107 percent had partial damage, major crops wrecks were the vegetable, corn and Garbanzo.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the State unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year we observed an accelerated growth, because since January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloenses were unemployed, a rate of 4.53% of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September, the average continued rising to 6.19 percent, a rate that many people cast more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.</seg>

<seg id="7">Lower liquidity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifaceted, for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the uas, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that since the public policy had been made.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors including the loss of liquidity in the market for purposes of a restriction of resources by legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money-laundering, to people who already agarra $illegally it is not easy for those who work, and the use of the invested in something," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Migration arrested</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Lopez Cervantes noted that the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The number of people who are going to the State in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first for the difficulties in entering, and second because entering already have too many difficulties finding jobs, that people are falling and are demanding sources of work here in our State, what makes unemployment rises," stated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Informality</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Labour market analysis Sinaloa is aggravated when considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38% of the employed population in the State is working without being contribution as worker before any social security institution.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pooled to unemployment and informality, other omissions of the State labour are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries of the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.</seg>
<seg id="16">The average monthly income of workers sinaloenses was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Contraction of FDI</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Coupled with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 has the highest decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Secretariat of economy from January to June of FDI State added 630 thousand 697 $, which represents a drop of 87.74% respect to the 143 thousand 312 $5 million registered during the same period the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="19">For its part, the Secretariat of economic development of the State Government recorded a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, which occurred primarily in the tertiary sector companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Debt</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Before the stage of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July to Congress State the adoption of a provision for 3 billion pesos, which themselves would be designed investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for $2 mil 600 million pesos, and until November have not seen the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the State economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Reactions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For representatives of the business sector, the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdés testifies to a lack of management capacity of the Government.</seg>

<seg id="25">"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work hard to regain the ground we lost in this year, in the 2012 have to redouble our efforts, failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new team of Government, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The replacement of analogue signals to digital is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Supreme Court (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes that took the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree that brought forward the so-called "blackout analogue" from 2021 to 2015, not to meet the eight votes required to upend it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón not exceeded their authority in issuing the Decree detailing the actions to be taken to follow up the transition to digital terrestrial television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With that result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed by not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court will pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains current.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The draft judgment drawn up by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of matters of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (COFETEL), in contravention of the principles of hierarchy and subordination Reserve Act.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Nor do I believe that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body ," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the Federal Executive, who has by constitutional mandate, the Rector of the State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The replacement of analogue signals to digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, that means a decision of the public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic issues, social, political and national security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Be formed on Wednesday the new Italian Government</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce the new Government will face a crisis that has pushed the country to the brink of economic disaster</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Designated the Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to introduce the new Government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A communiqué of the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a Government.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is expected to present a Cabinet composed largely of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new Executive will assume office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said that the President will submit the outcome of its talks with political parties in their attempt to form a Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti not said explicitly that will be able to form a Government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The "framework is now well mapped out," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of forming a government at least three days, much less than normal, while Italy battle a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, market instability placed the yield on the Italian 10-year BTP bonds to above 7%, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma marcegaglia, head of confindustria, the Italian employers, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot to this government."</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe this Government is the last chance for Italy out of this emergency situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success of Monti were boosted considerably by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe that efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result," he told the press Angelino Alfano, party secretary of centre-right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because, until now, many of their members were opposed to the majority government technocrat who is assembling Monti.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Monti's new government should have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be unpopular austerity reforms.</seg>
<seg id="20">Any blockade or delay in their efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack of financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti launched on Monday its consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth organizations and women.</seg>
<seg id="23">Will end his round of meetings on Tuesday evening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which has established a transition extremely rapidly in response to the crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief respite at the end of the week, when it became clear that Berlusconi will resign, the cost of Italian debt have now reverted to critical levels between the uncertainty on whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for defenses current financial eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti has said that his Government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on which politicians only give time to implement the reforms before early elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would like to include politicians in his Cabinet, but the big parties insist that must be formed only by technicians, an indication of its misgivings about a process required by the financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources noted that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is at the nation in the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For their supporters Ricans, is a dream come true that Pearl jam will rock in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are living through their fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us also.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is only our second time in South and Central America and until now has been magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="12">I've been in Costa Rica only once and holiday; it is a very beautiful country, and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there.</seg>
<seg id="13">So cheers us carry our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask this because there is a sort of devotion to the gang, the fans live with intensity the days before.</seg>
<seg id="15">What do you say to its most ardent followers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thanks for staying with us through all these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">We took almost 20 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people even longer refers to her concert as the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Does that adds a bit of pressure to his visit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the larger shows that we have reached during the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">Touching a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we will put in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">Really, we are very eager to touch there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we love surfear and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How was discovered that Costa Rica and their waves to surfear?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have many friends that are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in switch and the waves there are unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends always were to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surfear; this was how we learn, through people that loves the SURF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">To see the tour, have been delivering shows enormous with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What they have planned for submission in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Like we never touched it before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to provide the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to touch on a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse Repertory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat the Repertory.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why should that be?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe that is partly because we have nine discs and can touch more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the Repertory that Rato we are not to touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us baffled because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it becomes more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="37">Looking back, is it difficult to believe what has been achieved?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">Firstly, I believe that none of us would presume that we would be in a great rock band and have done so for more than 20 years ago that seems like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">Continue to count our blessings and we touched much that we can continue making music together.</seg>
<seg id="41">We all want, and we love to create music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky go to parts of the world that we always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What it meant to you to have been a key part of the emergence of grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Has always been an honour to be part of that group of big bands.</seg>
<seg id="46">Are very friendly people of soundgarden, mudhoney and Alice in chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">Is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is somewhat common.</seg>
<seg id="48">Occasionally there arises a band of a city, but is much stranger when five or 10 bands leave at the same time in the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and honoured to be part of the team of Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still touching with some of them occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in chains and we were in Canada with mudhoney, saw soundgarden's tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them yet and we are honoured to be part of that sound from Seattle that arose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Is also very strange that a band like you to remain united and with the same members therefore time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) are we joined 13 years ago, which, alone, is much more time than that lasted many bands.</seg>
<seg id="54">Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care for each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, there have been open boulevards musical that give him freedom to each experienced.</seg>
<seg id="56">We trust each other in the music of each, and could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The relationship you with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to its success, has been able to do what they want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How found a record?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">To as we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We ensure that not be too tour because it is easy to fall into this game of the large crowds and the people that loves your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">Until one remembered that the people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought, without encapricharse for being famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really interested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Another project recalls how his mother love bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Think we write very good songs and the principle was something grand.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were a band for almost three years and never issued a disk until after he died that Andy (Andrew Bretton).</seg>
<seg id="65">There were many frustrations because both would last and most important is that we are still very friends of Bruce (fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began with the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how I did laugh, was always a pleasure to get to work, laugh, talk of football and music, and much more.</seg>
<seg id="66">Was an amazing human being and what extrañamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The band the national robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie vedder, and that therefore the chosen for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band more that we liked, so we are anxious to see what the robertas can offer live and duty be very entertaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why always change the letter of yellow ledbetter live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That is a question for ed (Eddie vedder), so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings and I believe that it does so with the first thing that happens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">How downward, what are your influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Are so many.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the first that spring to mind are geezer Butler, John entwistle, C. J. ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, chuck dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">Are so many who could talk all evening on the bajistas that I adore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has managed Pearl jam maintain relevant the grunge despite not already be a fashionable?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I believe that all of us always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think of it, it reminds me of the gangs which I mentioned earlier, as mudhoney, soundgarden, nirvana and all those that emerged at the same time, and if there is relevance now, I think that it is wonderful because music is worth and hear bands like mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Initially, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">Why is this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem more light, but there are also songs, as the end, or just breathe that qualify as songs very dark though they may sound a little positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With both, when the ed I touched, I wept when I heard the songs and are deeply dark.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think when a vengeance and there is some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these things are starting to influence your art, your music and those two songs undoubtedly represent that for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also, I think that there can be a happy person and still be able to do music that is dark.</seg>

<seg id="1">Do park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects coincide in the timeliness of the Conference beyond polemics on fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The contest municipal on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Amediados of the 1980s, at the height of the already defunct corporation metropolitan Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some pasquines promotion collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure defined the mountain and the great park the metropolitan Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">Is more, the availability of a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park New Yorker.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again be placed in the fable of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, with the Catalan capital of the few that are not geared to the north-south axis but above (mountain) -abajo (Sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">Rating as the collserola natural park is in this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalís in the role of the yogi bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">In these was until, in September, the City Council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for many other gateways to collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door refers to the idea of Park, without doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">Or that or someone seeks to put doors on the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">The single question emerges: collserola, is park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The contest, both by his side as purely organisational thus poses of reflection on the town is the topic of conversation among all the architects barceloneses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Is already almost a recurring theme to that dip into when two members of this ancient caste of elected were recognised in an elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this fact gives rise, rightly, one of the few commonalities between what they think three architects barceloneses, and academics, that have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán, having addressed the front rim "is necessary to" discuss "the front of the mountain," any time that the speech by ildefons cerdà, the apples of the Greens, has not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It should be assumed that the park more extensive Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Inter alia for his great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex ," according to the architect for whom the title" gates collserola "holds a" trap léxica ": we must not think of them" as the entrance to a park, but the delimitation of the areas where we must act. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, labelled the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."</seg>
<seg id="23">Dangers of the "uncertain that is today projecting the public space" after this experience in the 80 and that was in the area of the fòrum "its swan song."</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the delimitation itself borders on where they can build.</seg>
<seg id="25">"limiting something is already setting the next step ," i.e. its sobrepaso.</seg>
<seg id="26">"must think in new instruments land-planning, planning, because the current [in reference to the plan General metropolitan (pgm) ] can give rise to real disasters."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">More confined ourselves to the question, mòdol believes that, by simplifying, the strand vallesana of collserola " may be understood as a park, the Barcelona, not ," by merely topographical.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mòdol recalls that already exists a work done by the collserola patronat of which "must not fall on deaf ears" While grateful for the opportunity that the City provides to its Guild intervene in this project "from the first moment."</seg>
<seg id="29">And further understands that the proximity of the mountains to the town is the safe-conduct that enables architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this is the technical profile that must lead to multidisciplinary teams ("a success story," points) that have been taken to create: "The architects should be just a tool."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the competition lack a global vision of collserola: "have been convened 16 contests cross-cutting -dice- montaña-mar in the sense, but there was no reading, longitudinal and understands that sees the area as a whole ."</seg>
<seg id="31">This leads to, at least in his case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can infringe in programme and definition with the architect of next-door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, that yes, the City Council should ensure that the Strip immediately superior to the round of FALD should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment to carry out a smooth transition between the town and the Verde.</seg>

<seg id="4">At their Conference a technological view of the potholes, enacted in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, unveiled that the laboratory to her Office develops asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with increased mechanical strength, both high and low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera found that this type of modified asfaltos could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, and some towns in the north of the country, to improve their performance, and therefore the formation of bumpy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Explained that the asphalt, the party more heavy oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, some high molecular weight, so-called asfaltenos, and other low molecular weight, so-called maltenos, which together give him the pavement his characteristic behaviour viscoelástico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Behaviour viscoelástico of asphalt is that at high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade introduced a State almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt turns quebradizo, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that in the streets, the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but they will be modifying during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The investigator of the fq observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by Flexible Pavement, which consists of six layers of material, of which the last three imply the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the layers more superficial is the folder tar, composed of small stones, covered in asphalt and then compacted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each piedritas that constitutes the kit, he noted, is tear-sodden with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">To traverse vehicles and efforts be generated, it permits forces are spread very well on the pavement.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it were modified asphalt would be disseminated even better, felt the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the folder tar, abundó, it puts a final layer called kit rolling, which is made of a material of high-grade stone, i.e. a sand that washes were also in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As is the layer that is going to be in contact with the tyres on the vehicles, should have more force mechanics that the folder tar and provide friction in the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">To be the party of pavement that will receive and disseminate efforts, the folder rolling also requires having the proper thickness and care should be taken of the material that is made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Climate, particularly the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, in particular water, he said, because significantly affects the performance of the portfolio tar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the ground was humedece, water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to leave, this causes a reblandecimiento of all the layers of the road surface and, therefore, the formation of bumpy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the process of formation of a bump, he said, the first to become blunt is the film of tread and only after it affects the folder tar, but the damage does not happen instantly, but that is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with adequate maintenance programmes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The also a member of the national system of researchers explained that the cargo vehicle is another important factor in the formation of bumpy and, therefore, the thickness of each layer on the pavement must be always in relation to the vehicular burden and ensure compliance, to avoid forming potholes frequently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the emulsions tar, which in other countries are already on the market and even allow repair the potholes with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">What failed him to the candidate of the valley to be the new miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors affecting for that Melina Ramírez Serna not reach the crown of miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle receives its title number 14 Princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the appetite of the crown of miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time Ramírez Melina Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium in winners, wear the crown of silver and the band credited as the new Princess of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where miss Atlantic reared with the Crown and the cetro, the Department already sum 14 titles and Melina be a Princess to the Legion of women vallecaucanas that have been near the Crown but were proclamations Princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), clear Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Ayala Bellini (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), rose Mary ALZATE (1983), Olga Maria Sands (1987), Leila blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María consoles pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Today the big question that many will ask is what was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite in that each submission showed that it had all to be the new miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the police and better face Jolie of vogue, titles that earned Queens taliana Vargas or as Natalia Navarro who took the crown of miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor is considered key in the decision made by the jury of designating first Princess is not convinced that with your answer to the question 'what is the book that you had marked to you and why? made by Martín Gómez Murillo, the cart literary read.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The interrrogante the vallecaucana responded:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think fairly in the literature, I think that is a form of culturalizarse, definitely I think the book that I set of children is" El principito, "the book is pretty profound.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently Leo "Crime and Punishment ," is a book of world literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called" the ardour of blood .""</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A response that little liked first by the term "culturalizarse" and second, by not explain in concrete terms how each of the books that have cited the marking.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at the end of the ceremony said Melina feel calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise is what needs to happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all the people, please read a little bit, "El principito 'is a great book"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among the scenarios he said that were delivered to valley the burned favouritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist bogotano hinted that to be the preferred, the ovacionada and the candidate that was all the preliminary awards (challenge of gastronomy oster, the public vote for the best costume artisanal, and Queen Mother), " that aroused jealousy of the other candidates, estresó to the Queen and therefore not sparkled in the arena ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And that it showed in its first submission in bathing costume on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the veiled coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although in both lució safe, it showed that lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed yes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, journalist agenda "at home," the station RCN felt that the fact that Melina outside designated Princess' checks that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not as Queen. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Furthermore, Valley were shown the latter very elusive with the press, and that was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to persuade the jury on his interest in the social work, which is, at last, the essence of the national contest of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="23">By something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy doughty stated that they were eyeing a woman committed to the social needs of its Pais.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"beauty alone is not enough in a miss Colombia, must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the contest are already involved in projects" explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Was also speculates that Valle was lethargic for their shortcomings in the derriere and fibrosis him harm in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury the elected as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the body more healthy, good food and physical labour responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The preparador of Queens Jorge Orozco Hernán recognizes that Melina was not the best body, which had better, "but its problem of Fibrosis in the abdomen, that truth for my was not very noticeable, he dropped points in the last day. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine cromos considers that the mistake of vallecaucana were surgical interventions was practised.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The surgeries are good, but the Valley is not known to do.</seg>
<seg id="29">His body was never his strong and here are the claimed. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">By this prize, which for the first time delivers the national contest of beauty, after the parade in bathing suit arose a cruel vaticinio last night which was fulfilled, as it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo awarded to Melina for not giving him a taste of the Crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Reality or not, it is certain that Melina since today begins a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as Princess, position where it offers the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the competitions by international designation's own national competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will go down in history as one of the Queens that despite its overwhelming step by Cartagena, he was elusive Crown.</seg>

<seg id="3">The work of these officials is key.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The past 4 November a lofoscopista of STI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum leader of FARC: "Alfonso Cano," through the comparison of their fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the sectional of STI, this week it came the turn of "availability " to Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada that brings 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To start his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where they often had to enter by more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000 he moved to the capital of the valley and, after conducting training courses, She specialises in lofoscopia, which is the study of skin from friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and the feet.</seg>

<seg id="11">Knew that should identify two corpses and it is suspected that one of them was the man who headed the guerrilla movement's oldest world, so we asked him to carry the card decadactilar of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when he came with the investigation team to the site in which the corpse was not recognizing him by his physical aspect, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">Was without beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much more thin.</seg>

<seg id="21">The dactiloscopia is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support investigations for such crimes as petty theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured.</seg>
<seg id="23">When they are caught, many criminals are false ballots or not have papers.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">The investigator told that, in a case of theft, it was taking away a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to draw a safe filled with jewelry and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult because there are surfaces appropriate to draw a printing displays, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," recalled.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of protesters marched to the Plaza agolpaban Zuccotti for bivouacking.</seg>
<seg id="3">A big Party attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Members of the occupy Wall Street movement challenged this Tuesday to the authorities in New York in seeking to enter again, under the umbrella of a court order, to the square in Manhattan from which they were evicted dawn and in trying to occupy another Park of the big apple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of demonstrators are agolpaban to the Zuccotti square, where wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignant" return to bivouacking at the site, while another part of the Movement responded to eviction occupy a park more north of the city, where there have been further arrests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the Plaza, we are going to install in any other place and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the Movement "occupy Wall Street," mark he.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He elaborated that the response of the "indignant" the eviction of their camp personally delivered by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where the judge Lucy billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the venue and allowed demonstrators to stay camped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal street and Sixth Avenue, very near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity church.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police came and started detaining some of the demonstrators, although he could not confirm the figure, while assured EFE that saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The organization ensures that are several hundred people who had been installed at this point, where it already has shifted a delegation of religious leaders in show of support to the members of the movement and that he had sought to mediate with the police.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, the Plaza Zuccotti - it is a compound of private property remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which we should analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Some of the protesters were carrying displaced so far and distributing these p.m. copies of the court order and even delivering the officers guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," he indicated, who reported that some officers severely beating demonstrators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The judicial order prohibits authorities to evict members of occupy Wall Street or implement "laws that were published after that began the occupation or forbid demonstrators re-enter the park with shops or other properties that were used previously."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Mayor Bloomberg suggested to the press that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space for the public and demonstrators, who cautioned, however, that local laws do not allow them to turn to install with tents and sleeping bags.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Regidor personally defended the eviction carried out dawn of the Zuccotti square, an operation in which were around 200 arrests and it was decided that because the demonstrators were "violating the law. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Bloomberg explained that gave the order to vacate the Plaza because it was turning "in a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others ," since" some businesses had received threats "and neighbours feared" for their quality of life. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"The eviction of this morning was stinking and shows that in the Fund, Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesperson of the Movement, who accused the Mayor of "failure to respect freedom of expression."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Those responsible for "occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they organize "big actions" for Thursday, in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that span the protests, which began on 17 September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Japan after the earthquake is resurrected</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that developed first into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country that underwent nipón since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first estimates by the Tokyo Government estimated material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, it seems to have lessened.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of declines, the finding of gross domestic product between July and September, served to turn the page, definitively: GNP increased 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter and 6 percent in annualized rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The recorded in the second quarter - to the Japanese, the fiscal year beginning in March 2012 - also assumes the highest pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recovery explains, in part, for the rally to the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to a decline of 0.9% in capital expenditure to be observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the real trigger for the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the momentum that Keynesian invited to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructures, exploiting gaps to grow from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.</seg>
<seg id="11">This variable rose 1 per cent, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The stigma of yen</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Tokyo has been assigned to the internal market, when the yen - the currency nipona - has become one of the "values haven" selected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of us, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of export companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of floating economic is determined by the health of the big groups technological.</seg>
<seg id="15">Toyota or Sony, for example, achacaron their weak results between July and September at the rate of the yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While markets remain with their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of yoshihiko Noda not lower its guard.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, the State Secretary for economic policy, motohisa Furukawa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And, in effect, the prospects are not encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries submitted in September clearest signs of economic slowdown.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">The CDU proposes electing the President by universal suffrage European</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="3">Was not originally included in the agenda, the future of Europe, but the item was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the policy of the Government is currently too lax with Greeks and it could be in a future with the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="4">The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine were against and 10 abstentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Finance Minister, opened any possible doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The key idea of the Chancellor, and the motion, are summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe represents peace but also because "nine million jobs depend directly upon the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To the Chancellor, 'the time has come to lead the way in Europe. "</seg>
<seg id="10">This could demonstrate changes in the Lisbon Treaty to enable strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="11">In any event, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Without doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven them to reach an early agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him, and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the ball being on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="14">Furthermore, delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to consider the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank in terms of weight of each economy, which clearly also reinforce the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Eager to calm tempers in the interior of her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But nor is it that he sought to win over his Congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or from countries in difficulties prepared to criticise the arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel has not mentado to France.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except in passing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleon.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The incidence of fraud in the low sickness</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a fund responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, the fight against fraud and the social ayudantía.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Moreover, to accompany such offensive, that part of the saving will rigorously, but still reminds an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of lack of power before taking the leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Ultimately, unless there is a Convention of company specific, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of wages, that is to say, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that approach would save EUR 280 million, according to les Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moreover, be accompanied by another measure with a scope more symbolic: impose to officials a day of leave without pay in case of leave (not, until now, are deficient, compared to the three days that was applied in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">As we discuss these issues, the majority once again on the table also the subject of fraud, this time geared towards abuse of parental leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">"are going to be considerably increased controls and, in addition, if they find someone committing a fraud, must reimburse the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand, speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seemed slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in area of low employment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, since 2002 is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched various offensive policies that, normally, have borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French not become ill more than in the rest of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watch with attention, firstly, national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the French Institute of Social Security (NCWA), in 2006, were paid more than EUR 237 million in benefits by low labour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in health economics, subsidies for the low represented, in 2008, 5% of health-care spending, rising to 11,300 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity leave and for occupational accidents, whereas 54% are associated with sick leave, a figure that amounts to EUR 6.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, the 2.5% of expenditure on healthcare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have caught an average of 14.5 days of leave, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the consulting group soul.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average that undoubtedly conceals deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management monster.com, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 employees French respondents claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, in this case the assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11 per cent were more protracted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons as other) ranged, in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared with undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id="25">Fraud has a fairly limited scope.</seg>
<seg id="26">The reinforcement of legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of sick leave of more than 45 days should be systematic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the NCWA found in 13% of the 285,000 made, that the casualties of short duration were "unjustified or too long ," i.e. 37.050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it found that 11 per cent of the cases were "properly adapted or unjustified; a figure which, taking as starting a total of 1.2 million, is $132,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Therefore, it makes a total of 169,000 cases "unjustified " between several million workers that cogieron a sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="30">Without doubt, a trifling figure in comparison with, for example, work in black.</seg>
<seg id="31">As the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, that practice would represent a loss of income tax of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros per year, i.e., more than the total cost of the subsidies for low and certainly considerably more than the fraud in this latter area.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Committee of Experts stated that should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Canadians live denied the death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, institutions of healthcare and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Canadian society lives by denying death.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, only 9% of Canadians is willing to talk with his doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make provisions to this effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which had the participation of six experts from various fields, including the ethical, legal and medical.</seg>
<seg id="7">This Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient asks that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">To begin, the experts cite a recent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada took the tenth post, the study points out that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the topic of death ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With medication or not, the 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, despite the majority of Canadians want to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them ends up dying in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, the highest rate recorded in this sense the Quebec, where 86 percent of the deaths occur in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrived at conclusions that do not match the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it wished to modify the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, according to the experts, we have also studied the situation in all the countries where such practices have been legalized or not constitute a criminal offence, there is no proof that the fact it is not considered a criminal offence has not resulted in an abuse of its implementation, namely, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons not competent or who had not given their consent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jocelyn downie, co-author of the report, stated yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, are showing more excesses in those countries where not been legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"in Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in Canada is practised assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Canadians, favourable to euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, since I believe that would enable persons whose death is next to alleviate his suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, 66% believed that the fact legalise euthanasia shall not understand that life for the elderly or the disabled has less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">In regard to persons who have practised assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believed that it should not begin a process against them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In connection with the continuation or discontinuation of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, between its recommendations suggest that specified in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally have been rejected, it is not a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Committee of Experts also requested that will train health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient would reject assistance to the end of his life without fear of confronting a complaint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, institutions of healthcare and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, regarding palliative or terminal sedation, which is already used extensively in health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, except that serve to reduce the physical pain, is considered as euthanasia and be subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other experts express reservations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Other experts in the field of the right to health have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in Health Law, called it "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, inter alia because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has over 18 years can seek help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Deschamps also highlights that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy on any other value of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">But adds that "in society, there are tags and limitations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The specialist in health law Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" with regard to the report's findings, which he termed a "manifesto for euthanasia."</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, questioned the lack of abuse especially in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Energy policy:</seg>
<seg id="2">Facts must assert more that the dogmas</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If there is one issue that cannot be treated in the light of considerations of short-term or simply thinking on emotions, is energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and the cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is appropriate that a gathering electoral be time to reflect on such issues and about the place of nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will be useful only if studying the whole of the economic, social and environmental impact of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must base its opinion on objective facts, in sound data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic changes will mean a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless depriving a huge proportion of the global population of a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, that will alleviate the growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Fukushima accident did not alter any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, Germany remains alone in his decision to renounce nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is not the case nor of Belgium, that put yours to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or Switzerland, which only aims to build plants last generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to quote some examples, continue with determination with their projects.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States, by his side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its Park, picking up the construction of a central suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, based on renewables, presents sometimes as an example, reality goes against such a speech.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will be a rise in the price of electricity, enhanced energy dependence by the increased need for gas imported, in particular from Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions by building gas plants and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a few months, will be felt the harmful effects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Must meditarse on the case of Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="19">European champion in the wind turbine sector, which gets 30 percent of its electricity, is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas due to the breaches of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of their electricity are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the perseverance of our energy policy, our neighbours paid an electricity bill 40% above the homes of the French.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the utility industry in the national territory, French companies are benefiting from cheaper electricity for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would entail a strong rise in the price of electricity, which cuts into realism to the wonderful statements on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a price that a vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, according to the surveys show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Remember that energy policy of our country has lost build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs Director and 410,000 indirect jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Widely export-oriented, covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and that can create jobs not deslocalizables.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France decide to abandon nuclear energy, would see the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of the EUR 6 billion yearly in French export of nuclear equipment and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">What would an electrician RPA designed to function sixty years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer?</seg>
<seg id="28">To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, like nor is there a diabolical source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Development by Areva solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary power sources.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy, it is vital to maintaining the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a safety authority that exercises tight control and transparent both on existing plants as on building flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed by security.</seg>
<seg id="33">In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one, the Three Mile Island occurred in normal operating conditions; provoked no consequences and for the people or for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some human error unforgivable.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as did the previous two.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Thanks to these developments and to cooperation between security authorities, and operators and shipbuilders French and German, the RPA presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While I studied all the actors electrical wanting to build a central, the interruption of its construction at flamanville would be a great gift for competitors from Areva and EDF, because that would leave them free rein to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.</seg>
<seg id="40">Is indispensable and legitimate look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave that emotion, dogma and manoeuvring partisan dominasen such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration, does a burden or an opportunity for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from various points of view: the saturation of the police service, judicial and administrative subjected to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the Statute self-described "country of human rights " of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, is the administrative harassment of foreign students who has skipped to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming of past that France "does not need overseas talent, workers or waiters."</seg>
<seg id="4">However, rarely looked at from the economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The issue is that, on this subject, there is considerable consensus amongst the left and the right.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set guidance declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million migrant workers ," while on the left, the tone was set as Michel Rocard explaining that France" cannot take all the misery of the world "in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, both left and right shared fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.</seg>
<seg id="9">To both sides, is considered that immigrants are a burden for the economy and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which operate with regard to immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include trivia, indicating that the co-development will solve the "problem of migration."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is electorally profitable, but economically sale very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As economists indicate Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that summarizes the most up-to-date knowledge on immigration (exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 pp.), a broad consensus exists among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth, salaries and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Limiting immigration weakens growth and it is detrimental to employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace national workers, particularly for the low-skilled, pushing to trim their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary that substitutes for national workers and professions exercised mainly in sectors with lack of employment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Immigrants low-skilled work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The same way that a surgeon would struggle to work in a country that takes lack of anaesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants that leads to the arrival of these latter will positively influence wages and employment of nationals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent of migratory flows presents a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">And, without taking into account the fact that diversity that provide immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (there is a large proportion of Nobel prizes and naturalized American companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Also immigrants are net contributors to social systems, because contributing an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arrives with an age of 30 years, will make a net contribution (income less expenses) 150,000 euros to public budgets on average during their lifetime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the beginning of its mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek points of growth that he lacked "with its teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">These teeth, that disuadieron immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="21">The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that may not be taken without democratic legitimacy total, except perhaps to lead us to disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Having long struggled against this motion from the Socialists and of Jacques Delors, the whole world asks in the present European economic governance.</seg>
<seg id="23">So.</seg>
<seg id="24">But think about it without greater political integration and democratic, and without that it is seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We must assume a new stage of European construction.</seg>
<seg id="26">To build the Republic in France, had to be "done" Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="27">The revolution motivated by interests would not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="28">This lesson remains applicable.</seg>
<seg id="29">We must build a more integrated Europe economically.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true popular sovereignty European.</seg>
<seg id="31">To build Europe, do Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Nord Stream pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly with Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea has already been put into service.</seg>
<seg id="3">Must deliver gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the giant Russian gas, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline connecting directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and its counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have evolved together the wheel of the valve, which controls the entry of Russian gas in the grid of Western Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new pipeline, each year will reach 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe via a first took of 1,224 km linking the St Petersburg region with the land of mecklemburgo-pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube should be completed in late 2012 that will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, i.e., enough to cover the entire French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, there is already talk of the possibility of constructing a third tube for the same journey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the expeditious completion of this huge labour introduced Aires of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Poland and the Baltic countries had been firmly opposed to the project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, Nord Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course for ground third countries (Poland and Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Coup, these two countries are losing something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening to block access to the markets of Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of the debate, Warsaw not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream as a "new Compact germano-soviético," in reference to the Alliance of Hitler and Stalin for occupying Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">I.e., whether the topic is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, to support the Russian draft, has got greater security of supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a divide between Europeans from East and West.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has known, in just five years, do succeed his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and Western countries, rich, large consumers of gas and reserves in ever more limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites of organic form," confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the big contracts the gas sector are as much political as economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of directors of Gazprom, numerous in lubmin, at the point of arrival gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline also represents a technical achievement.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tube is made of steel submarine under cement to protect against the anchors of ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">Be supported in the bottom of the Sea, to an average of 200 m deep.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="25">"was necessary to remove or destroy one hundred of them, out of caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also proved necessary to step up the measures of protection of wildlife.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length. Neither valves, nor by stations maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scheduled a platform of control in waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project had renounced the same to see the Swedes were not very willing to allow a society Russian State be established permanently in the sea off its shores.</seg>
<seg id="29">"in case of breakdown, we shall adjourn the passage of gas in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In case of leakage, the gas pipeline will be released, therefore, to the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="31">But builders considered unlikely a flight, since planned gaskets that, according to forecasts, will take a flight every 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The State's control of the gas pipeline is guaranteed through a robot submarine, dragged down by a ship which conducts inspections foreign, as well as through a device that circulates inside of the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the form of a pure, introduces in the interior of the pipe, which has a diameter of one metre, and moves with gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on potential deformities of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any type of reparation.</seg>
<seg id="36">The movement of gas is guaranteed merely by pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">The principle is 200 bars and, with the departure of 100 bars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have joined forces in order to carry out this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The enterprise leader is Gazprom, which holds 51 percent of shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">To it, joined the German BASF and E.ON (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five societies have created a joint company, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for constructing and running the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">Has its headquarters in zoug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favourable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Later, Gazprom rented to this society, for a renewable term of 25 years, the entire transport capacities of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay him for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas which is really transport," said Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Financing the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30 per cent with the input of shareholders and 70 per cent, through bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the works should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But minority shareholders are sure not to exceed its investment, because Gazprom assumes alone the risk of costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in lubmin, in a sandy coast planted pine.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some valves, with 4.5 metres in height, form the exit door of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">There are sensors that measure pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before being transferred to the pipelines Germans.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, the terminal, receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.</seg>
<seg id="53">To total capacity, will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers is still so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Some 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for a job.</seg>
<seg id="3">The XV week for the employment of disabled persons begins today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is double the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is discouraging?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No," says Éric blanchet, Director-General of adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled persons.</seg>
<seg id="7">"progress since fifteen years ago are considerable.</seg>
<seg id="8">"back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, there is still much to be done."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It is worth mentioning that the unemployed disabled still face numerous obstacles to access to employment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tend to have a more advanced age: 37 per cent have more than 50 years (17% of average).</seg>
<seg id="12">Have a level of qualification little high: 80% has not ended the baccalaureate and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, long-term unemployment is rife among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38% of average.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is to say, there are many issues that hinder especially the return to the working world and that "constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian grapin, Director-General of tremplin, a partnership established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These are obstacles goals.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mindset of the people is progressing, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study carried out in April by the Association for ims-entreprendre the Cité noted that managers surveyed have "a level of knowledge on the disabilities under," with a "overrepresentation of persons in a wheelchair, poor physical or intellectual."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of hiring a 6% of disabled workers, goal set in an act... 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, achieved a ratio of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"now reached around 3 per cent," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">Proof: the number of establishment 'subjected to this input, "like the amounts disbursed, have declined between 2007 and 2011, from $59,000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The 2005 Act, which increased inputs, generated a huge pressure for businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement also reflected a genuine awareness, in particular among the big groups."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies that possess between 20 and 49 has employed disabled workers in its staffing, compared to 82% of companies between 100 and 199 workers.</seg>
