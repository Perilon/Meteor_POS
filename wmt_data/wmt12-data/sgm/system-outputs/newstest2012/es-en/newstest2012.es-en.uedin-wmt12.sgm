<seg id="12">It is not surprising that the Islamic fighters accept grateful for the help of dogs infidels.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only justification was that, in his view, the NATO attacks was not an American general, but large Allah, whose greatness held after each successful interventions.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The stylist must also be a good psychologist, argue professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the introductory article, how they learn the stylists, I complained a little of that initial lessons were already pretty loaded.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had no idea how it would be.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three conferences professional expertise, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer they are final exams, more information and practical tasks lie ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have studied with the director, Alena, (in no man) on how to dress for women who do not have a perfect symmetry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And that is the vast majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized without the proper curves and someone is overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The stylist has learned to relax optically a broad shoulders, extending a neck or recreate the necessary curves</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, huge breasts and hips and waist close and at the same time not too challenging vestirla</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers are not appropriate, it is worth taking sewing at least an extra piece of cloth.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly will not regret, because the clothes that feel perfectly is unaffordable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">With a skirt to measure will be much better than one that is constantly moving, get up, dancing in the waist, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The body estilizado can afford to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapeados.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are certainly many types of information and a number of bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to bring order in my head all this information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even so, I am afraid that with the task assigned, I have more than enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each participant in the way it has been allocated two famous, who will design two rooms: One for the day and night.</seg>
<seg id="20">We must take into account the current issue, the fashion style that fits in with the person in question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I was touched "dress" Miranda Kerr, perhaps the campaign speak of the Victoria's Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Cry inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who recently have fattened around 100 kilograms (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes have to be cut from magazines or on the Internet and imprimirlos them, and then drawing them graphically.</seg>
<seg id="24">The moodboard, as is the result, he expressed our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is also important to think about the graphic of the styling.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stylist, therefore, is not only physically, but also addresses, for example, in the pages of magazines (of specific issues, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">All this we spoke the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But all this is already on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The stylist has to have a global vision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The three invited specialists cheered the conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer and Jakub Polanka Ben Renč fashion photographer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist saberle should take advantage of this.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a good stylist knows how to work with the same piece of clothing in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variability is, in this case, essential.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Well, such gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) you can wear jeans and a T-shirt with classic, but also serves to clothe the naked body with tacón shoes and photographing him as if it were in fact a clothing.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just arremangarla and raise the neck to get a completely different picture.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Jugad with this," we insisted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">What I appreciate is the following advice: "To start work, we need to speak first of all the rules."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Then you can break them off," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, it is clear why memorizamos all these formulas, which combines with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines are different results.</seg>
<seg id="41">That without talking about the parades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve, which aims to photograph.</seg>
<seg id="43">So, for a history of fashion with 10 pages, therefore, ten outfits), we must be prepared, ready for use, at least 15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And in addition to the photos clothing works in combination with other clothes, all of which are different from those used in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of the success.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna, who is not a great singer, but the image and the márquetin have made her a global star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear trend to use the services of the stylists.</seg>
<seg id="49">Until the celebrities also are useless (enough my skills, my physical appearance is not so important).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And when people ask us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a very different from his size (lower).</seg>
<seg id="51">Then there is just guglear magazines and find out if the heart has already been written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened / thinned, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">On Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the stylist would not just be in fashion, but they must understand outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">During his work, especially to communicate with the people who dresses, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">Known to the people, not less, defends his views.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"When you hired a director to clasifiquéis costumes and completéis with nice clothes, you can't catch and throw everything and say: 'Oh la la what horror". "</seg>
<seg id="56">"Encontrad at least a couple of things that you consider and recommend to someone they can get," says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He also showed us that everything should be on the so-called "placovka", that is to say, the stock market.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is set around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Are items such as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. There are also (nylon thread that serves the stylist during the session of photos of products such as handbags or caps), the lure of clothing special caution ahead, if this were more (the cobbled together and other enganches are not allowed, it could damage the fabric), or a sewing kit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Not to stand in the passive listening and put something in place, we have learned to take the often of shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even during the sessions of photos in the study, on a flat surface, it could damage the often and much more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And we did not do more to take and take.</seg>
<seg id="63">We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to harm them by accident.</seg>
<seg id="64">So we had to be very good.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservations.</seg>
<seg id="66">The truth is that I was not very well these skills.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a small part of all those who have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.</seg>
<seg id="68">I have noticed that engage the styling at a professional level is not a bed of roses, but I am just like what people say.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Need for Speed: The Run it competes across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Book review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">A trip, in principle, carefree, is complicated by a series of lapses unfit for a routine during the morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">To some extent it managed to meet expectations, but it is nothing if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new provision, which was added to the title The Run, aroused great expectations even before its premiere.</seg>
<seg id="6">It promised to provide oxygen to the former racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, appears as a game that should not end up being another kind of action.</seg>
<seg id="7">We are also curious to know how they would be inserted scenes, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on his own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results did not vary much of what we had hoped for.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are races that can be acceptable, but the total lost points because of failures absurd, which are already appearing in the series for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact cannot be called mistakes, but rather the reluctance incomprehensible of programmers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are you into a story, the protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; for them, he offers to take part in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">You sentáis behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to be the first to New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea is to offer something interesting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into 10 stages and then, in more than 50 races.</seg>
<seg id="16">It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="17">That way, you do not have anything like the feeling that the game will always the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some of the areas are even pleasant, although the technical level of the figure is equivalent to that of previous rendition of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the walk in the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered in snow produced a very nice visual effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In addition, racing diversify from time to time by an atypical element.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, for example, in the desert you encontráis a sandstorm that reduced visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">In contrast, in the mountains, we must be careful lest you sepulte an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">According to this, each of the racing is very well developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are only a couple of models, but this is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a time, for bringing a number of rivals demanded (in a classic race), after buying time to give (mourning classic timed) and then I expected a duel against a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the midst of all this is sometimes the police, which will only make things more difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The new is the landscape outside the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">When Jack interactive animations are, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you must help, provided by clicking the button at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game of what might be expected (in particular, there are only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">But the end result is positive, because it is not to be disturbed and, in the context, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model of driving is the traces of the previous episodes.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that today is no longer much, but it cannot be said that it is bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">If a realistic simulation buscáis, because you can look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But in a race with some action designed it quite this style of driving, although we can find something better between games of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, all in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the problems arise after a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the right of the models of driving, because this is not the case with collisions.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such games is not expected to recreated with deformities and collisions complicated, but in fact before a coup against any object, you cannot predict how they will react to your car, so that not everything is in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is typical that, in a very tight forward or move the car with a normal traffic, has only light friction, but in other situations almost identical, your car just doing stunts got out of control.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even just totally destroyed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system of reseteo, there are major problems, but it may be giving you a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="44">The reseteos are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or sales of the runway, the game you revert back to the last point of rescue on the runway.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, in each race only five reseteos available.</seg>
<seg id="46">If the consumís all, you have to restart the race from the start.</seg>
<seg id="47">So it is no more than a help in the event that something is not going well, but it is not very unreliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, or the reseteo aid, only learned the stage with the aid of memory.</seg>
<seg id="49">A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.</seg>
<seg id="50">In some curves, for example, is to enter a specific way; otherwise, it is impossible to take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Other times you encontráis somewhere vehicles "civilian" always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or lleguéis five minutes sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="52">This makes rabiar especially in situations when they see that two cars that are going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent is without problems, but when you have arrived, you must be either stop.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is like when lleguéis, because it is scheduled for the "surprise" always happens in front of your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents also have an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game llegaréis to sites where, without taking into account the time, provided you can do the same opponent in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">In addition to this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.</seg>
<seg id="57">Your opponent must come before you, whatever the cost.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it is in front of you, you makes the vision of the cars coming up, so that you can be beaten to start the car.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that will disappoint you immediately.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is a pity, because although the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and action, so often it is not possible to continue to detail what happened or where.</seg>
<seg id="61">And indeed it does, if the credit is the idea with 50 or exclusive leads the league in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must be alert to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because it is you have to change their car, although the vast majority of cases you just what you have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for highways and the exotic superdeportivos straight driving for a technical, for example, winding mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It is also a main narrative thread of parallel challenges, that is to say, there are careers in specific locations to be known by the stories.</seg>
<seg id="67">Conseguiréis medals not only here, but also points to experience for your profile, which serves both to the challenges as the stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">To reach the highest level, the driver he opened several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds to the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the same time, there are connected a role Autolog online, to compare your results with those of other players and other functions disponibiliza triennial-intake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the most difficult to understand is how it is made the last race in history.</seg>
<seg id="71">With the car you have arrived to the subway tunnel (may), where you ponéis to run in the dark by the (pass).</seg>
<seg id="72">The speedometers os marks between 150 and 200 km / h (passes), and all of a sudden, you get behind the convoy and the subway is ahead.</seg>
<seg id="73">In drafting surely will have a discussion on this for several days, whether during the programming of the game a little or none thought even if the authors we really taken by a bunch of stupid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side of the game is not unusual, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases, pleasant, sometimes even soberbios.</seg>
<seg id="75">Because what a pity that, in the most tense moments reduces the quality of image and, at times, in a serious way.</seg>
<seg id="76">This applies especially to accidents where involved many participants, when the quality of continuous image is no longer valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In order to be most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother," but it may be assumed that no one would buy the stake only for his music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game to avoid mistakes absolutely stupid, we have problems in saying that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">Gives the impression that the game is not over.</seg>
<seg id="82">The fun is guaranteed, but then because the mistakes you will, in the eyes with the force of a spotlight of airport.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Czechs have a reputation for negativistas and Eurosceptics.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">"The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I expected to be montase an all-out war."</seg>
<seg id="5">"The last five, six years before the situation has stabilised somewhat, calming and new players get used to their new roles," as the conference began with conviction at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How does not take seriously its slogan "clearly and openly about Europe," he said in the first part of the conference, when he described each body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, that would be the envy of many speakers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Vicenová also weighed the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"First comes the criticism, that if it is dull, grey official, capable of taking any role, but I have to say that left everyone confused because they assume their roles to perfection."</seg>
<seg id="9">"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and that has a clear vision of where the EU should go."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is out of the question: "Who is this? What number I can call it? '. So this is an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union of states such as China and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">No one wants to prevent us from the cheese Olomouc</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Vicenová has also been on the agenda was, is and will continue to the European Council in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs were emerging from the economic crisis, settled the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative, which were heavily affected by the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU has for the moment many commitments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the ambassador, "a good fuss," not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the other hand, we must approve the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the budget is simpler and more effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and less? This is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The ambassador also recalled its main slogans, which arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The truth is that I do not like the Ugly abreviaciones, extranjerismos or jargon that people do not understand."</seg>
<seg id="22">"How can a citizen to understand that in Brussels are not invented really cucumbers round or curvos cucumbers, bananas of various sizes and that no one is going to ban the Olomouc cheese?".</seg>
<seg id="23">It also aims to get more of the atmosphere of the EU and bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We expected the Europe of the speeds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people felt more positive than negative aspects.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, regretted the low turnout of the Czechs in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fault lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of encouragement, but also the little support for the Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, underscored the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Believe me when I go to a Polish and Hungarian and I was on a Slovak, a Frenchman in my hand, I said: 'What, as you have been, the Visegrád?", and is not to make any grace. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, faces budgetary policy harsh new regulations for the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="31">Is perceived as a very real concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new "European Federation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have countries in the euro zone and countries outside the euro zone."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."</seg>
<seg id="34">"For the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those who are not to be left out."</seg>
<seg id="35">"These procedures will be increasingly and strengthen the two-speed Europe," is expected Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this regard, he also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the issues that affect the whole of the EU must be discussed between the member states, not only among members of the euro zone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brand story:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovative IBM enters its second century of existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If you find a term to define precisely the strategy of IBM, the clearest would be "long term."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, have already passed 100 years since its founding.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this nature largoplacista was the first head of the signing, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.</seg>
<seg id="6">As he coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to believe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Its slogan "Think!" Became his trademark, around which will build the life of the future (giant was also the title of an internal newsletter that IBM began to publish in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">Watson was also the basis of a culture of company carefully lifted.</seg>
<seg id="9">"For us, IBM is a long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and prospered during 100 years for that reason, because he stuck to its basic principles, but some fear the changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">This has enabled us during our first century, transforming technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope to prosper even more in our second century, "he said during his anniversary, the current director of the Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A sophisticated system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, as in the 1930s, took care of its employees as the operator in the Czech Republic (Baťa IBM employees were among the first American employees were paid holidays, sure, a sophisticated and elegant uniforms pay system that rewards the best inventors and sellers.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same sophistication in the long term the keeps IBM in the relationship with the customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (to be one of the first global companies in ending discrimination of any kind, could choose without problems).</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which Palmisano will next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">She has been working 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In recent years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, of which there are countless future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is not surprising that allowed ideas, because the signature work almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Institution with a good reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.</seg>
<seg id="23">"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution rather than technology company," said the economist, a professor at the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of the technology," said George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or the "Great Green - as it is affectionately known in the US because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is perhaps the most versatile (develops technology company both equipment and software, Web hosting services and infrastructure in a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).</seg>
<seg id="28">Has the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among their inventions are the ATM, payment cards, the swaps, the bar codes and diskettes.</seg>
<seg id="30">This year, IBM facturará 220 billion. This year has become the second technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when exceeded for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking to the future</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the tastes of customers and the time (IBM not opted for its own operating system, genital / 2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).</seg>
<seg id="33">"If your business is based on progress, cannot emotionally anchor in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms (and, if they do not work, the leaves).</seg>
<seg id="35">And that is the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and falls exclusively with Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The future technology</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In terms of sales, IBM is devoted primarily to services, of which about a fifth of programs and one fifth of equipment.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the quota of suppliers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets with a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, has invested $58 billion purchase of technology in the future.</seg>
<seg id="40">The investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time was the modern global financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM acts according to the premises of his former boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis of the 29 increased investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">Until now, the company seems that IBM has been able to weather the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the shares of IBM since the beginning of 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">IBM's currency is change everything, except its value.</seg>
<seg id="45">It can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this giant flexible aguantará.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM history: From the cutters of cheese to space flight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The company, International Business Machines (IBM) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The name IBM adopted as early as 1924 - originally was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The foundation that led to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880's.</seg>
<seg id="50">Owned inventions such as the famous "watch out," which allows us to control the entry and exit of employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over its supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="52">Fichó Flint, the head of a company in competition, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson remain the firm basis for corporate culture and identity.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the company until the year 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, cheese and meat cutters to tills.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years that Watson led the company, the turnover doubled in 9 million and began a major expansion of the company on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly 40 years in the chair of the leader, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM began working in the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s, the staff and the IBM computers helped NASA to guide flights into space (Mercury, Saturn and in 1969, the famous flight to the moon).</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System / 360.</seg>
<seg id="61">The classics "pecés", which established the standard of computers at the time, came to the market with the IBM 5150 in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which acquired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to offer a comprehensive advice and high value-added services.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy has paid IBM these past three years is smarter Planet, that is to say, "a smarter planet."</seg>
<seg id="64">Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, but have not yet been planned areas and has improved the circumstances, for example, in terms of transport and the administration of cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the trade sector, IBM was not long ago the platform "Smart Commerce" that allows retailers to manage the business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a long history in this country.</seg>
<seg id="67">In 1932, opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, which was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, IBM ČR operates in the strategic focus of outsourcing in Brno.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How prices have evolved since 1989 travel</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Czechoslovakia in 1989 had until then only five state travel agencies 91,458: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies of the time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists were, therefore, on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime was tilted towards the west and travel to the Czech tourists were then quite limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. the Checoeslovacos) are not allowed to travel freely and individually or even by the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland and the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agencies offered in those days will also travel to the West, but one should be put to the tail with a sleeping bag and spend it all night, or "good friends" in the agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet not everything was won.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, is not attached to the "people politically unreliable," that they could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovak currency is not freely convertible currency and, with no guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the West) to travel to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, which had a large number of huts and houses of summer, the Czechs bought. This custom still persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The way to travel to the Czech Republic has suffered since 1989 a real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While until 1989 for us was not going over the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs were 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">NNA great paradox is that now we are not aware of the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the early 1990s was imposed visa exemption to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which resulted in a huge wave of short stays, especially to Vienna or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The checoeslovacos, for a long time, they were tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a time.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris slept the Czechs in parks in tents, as our income, then we were not allowed to pay a hotel or pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was the carry (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech koruna, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy Western currency freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living, and he also increased average wages, what about 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With the increase in demand for travel agencies began in 1997 with regularity, to prepare travel using the connections of charter flights, which was incredibly low prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the 90 of the last century, as the Czechs travel visa-free to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which simplified further our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario happened in 2000, when he was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and went to Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since that year, assume direct charter flights every year with Czech tourists for distant countries and hot. This winter it will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">The visit exotic countries currently nearly 100 thousand Czechs per year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting time of this era, which symbolizes our development pos-revolucionario, arrived in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On 17 November 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists, with what our country has to be among the world's most developed countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in its history, has spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent on travel abroad more than 15 billion Czech crowns per head, including spending on the farm.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">General Assembly meeting convened to elect the president, which could end in stalemate.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For nearly five months, the Czech football is not president, and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR), is not known or after the convening of the next General Assembly meeting this Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without them, will not be able to vote even to choose among the three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stakeholders to preside over the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hašek resigned from his post in June, but not before calling on their colleagues to find a strong person who knew deal with the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was highlighted on 16 September when he had to be elected the new president.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates to the General Assembly met in vain in the Casa Nacional (Národní dům), located in the suburb of praguense Smíchov, because the talks were blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">No consensus was reached or as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives and delegates with full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">From that moment, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, endorsed the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, under which the representation for full powers is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">More light on the situation could not throw or the Executive Committee that, in their meetings, Ordinarias or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.</seg>
<seg id="14">The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already, but the focal point remains the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, which, in the direction of the association, which represents professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate with the greatest percentage of support in the federation which will present his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="18">The region of Moravia is willing to compromise in order to win the candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both federations.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Bohemian, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations percentage should have the majority of at least two thirds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"It would, however, the sense of the two previous rounds and negate the entire concept of a bicameral system," as well as Svoboda understands the concerns of the morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With that, surprisingly, is also agree Tomaš Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates should be more Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I would like to vote as possible in accordance with the statutes."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Not to invent any nonsense about representatives at the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and that his comments directed mainly against Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him, in Nymburk will decide on the new president, and he believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">"All the passions are apaciguarán with the party today of our national team in the European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Football will be a player, and cooperate more at ease," said the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professional and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is the more reticent.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope to reach an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is not about the conflict between bohemios and Moravians, but there are attempts to tighten the rules for their own convenience."</seg>
<seg id="31">"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Anyway, I hope that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">There is not much time for all parties to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations had to be made in Montenegro, but who can know until we start the party if the football team will be complete?</seg>
<seg id="35">The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other Rajchl Kucera and Dalibor vice presidents, has not been this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport to the executive committee at the place where the party will take place classification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which reported to be held this Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">To Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to bring the parties divided the country's most powerful sports organization to come to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">The stakes are high: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak federation (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of Sazka lotteries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík will fight for the presidency, because it is a more suitable candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly extraordinary knew the name of a suitable candidate to pay all their ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or run as a candidate for a post as relevant.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If the right person, I would be fighting for it, and I would not be a candidate in the elections."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But so far has not been able to find such a person," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block Pelta, the winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR).</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also points out that, if they win, would remain in the office of the president only until 2013, when will the turn of the general assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In that post he would like to see an expert and a good manager who is not too concerned with the football events.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I have already spoken to some people who could take into account."</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment even want to identify with the Czech football."</seg>
<seg id="48">"I would like to change that vision," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What aggravates Paclík at this point is Pelta's relationship with the president of the Football Association of Regional Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a past controversial, known as a powerful outside the little world as with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the chair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If he wins, it would maintain the current status in football and nothing will change."</seg>
<seg id="52">"With the support of Berbra, a businessman ambitious, football will draw even less," said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Also mentioned the fact that a few years ago on behalf of Pelta was associated with a telephone tapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, which Pelta went unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I don't know what football prestige could bring Pelta's victory."</seg>
<seg id="55">"We will look into the eyes and with UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, which also takes caution his earlier statement that "Pelta Pilsen if the club would become president."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík cooperation with Pelta could arise in the future.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the opinion of another candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (Pelta) would be the first to be followed."</seg>
<seg id="59">"It is very capable."</seg>
<seg id="60">"I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation."</seg>
<seg id="61">"But not as a manager of a partnership."</seg>
<seg id="62">"I do not go the nose where I am not capable," added Paclík, which in September drew a lot of attention to support the suspension of the Commission of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, replaced later by Dagmar Damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík admits that it would manage the partnership.</seg>
<seg id="64">Uses its management of private companies, since the summer is also the director of Pilsen, whose support held in May the triumph in the first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the strength to change some things in football and contribute to their practice safe."</seg>
<seg id="66">"To reduce the influence of certain lobbies, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their antipathy towards the president of Daniel Křetínský Sparta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">One of the priorities would be to strengthen the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee FAČR and, with the help of which pressure on political leaders to put more money into the sport of taxes in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It is one of the key problems that should be devoted to the new president."</seg>
<seg id="69">"If you increase taxes on gambling, as it announced the political parties would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going," says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Moreover, Paclík now does not even take account of their association with the club Pilsner, although he says that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan."</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">"But I do not see any sense to give my actions hypocritically Club of Pilsen to another person and then return there after a year and a half," said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">FAČR Pelta promised a new constitution that would end up with the deadlock of the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, would ensure that the FAČR had a new constitution that would definitely to settle future disputes regarding the electoral rules.</seg>
<seg id="76">The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Even before the elections in September, Pelta focus promised, if elected, particularly in the representation and raise funds.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the last minute decided to participate in the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months I could go either to defend and, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People of all levels of football is a long time ago and expected this Thursday, the new president."</seg>
<seg id="80">"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the partnership," the man who is associated mainly with the Club of Jablonice, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="81">For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as we thought."</seg>
<seg id="84">"If we exclude certain interpretations, we need a president since September," Pelta warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I am elected president, I take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond in the event that it fails."</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In addition, in theory, is not to tamper with their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">As in the past, had warned that it was working with Henry Rajchl, respect for their training in law, be aware that his opponent would be their first vice president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with head.</seg>
<seg id="91">"For more than a year in the world of football, and has already achieved some successes."</seg>
<seg id="92">"Their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"That is why many of them have doubts about its true nature," he said to his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements announced in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the competitions.</seg>
<seg id="95">The latter should be a showcase of promotion of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose as a result of the bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Immediately after I would involve in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," said two months ago to the ČTK the candidate of 46 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">Then also promised that his appointment as chairman of the football staff did not lead to any change of the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="99">"Would have to know the work of each employee," he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable anxiety.</seg>
</p>	
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicting that before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday at Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, no doubt we shall overcome.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if finally has a leader", two days before the most crucial time in his career of representative, Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start to work with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If the fourth General Assembly elected the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association, many people would probably resentful.</seg>

<seg id="109">"Since the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, professional football or the training of young footballers of high performance."</seg>
<seg id="110">"This is not to say that it would all alone," he said in an interview for the Rajchl ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can engage in a specific area."</seg>
<seg id="112">"And asignaré difficult tasks that football can, in each of these segments, to go ahead with a lot of momentum."</seg>
<seg id="113">"This is probably not many people will be happy, because it will begin to work very hard and not just to criticize the work of others," he added.</seg>

<seg id="121">"There are processes that had begun and that will have its effect within a couple of years and I would like someone to stop," announced concerned by the fact that, if elected to another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the partnership could be as it was before the era of Hašek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.</seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind him is especially all the people who would be in charge of football to be only a privilege for a select few."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I cannot be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone."</seg>
<seg id="125">"I try to be objective."</seg>
<seg id="126">"I would like to make a football for everyone, because only then will be well all and not just those elected," said Rajchl.</seg>

<seg id="128">"Although some people are trying to pretend otherwise, I have in mind to do the utmost to Moravia."</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is time to think about the fact the split second division in the Czech Republic and other morava, whose winners would go to the first division."</seg>
<seg id="130">"It would not give the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which is a problem for the Moravians young players," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Although the struggle of the presidential elections joined Tomaš Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I still have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which I chose as his deputy, and we know that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include savings of tens of millions of kroner disadvantageous contracts, the television contract talks and negotiations on the law of the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, acknowledges his part of the blame for the federation is not united.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to restore confidence in the Czech football," said the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer football.</seg>
<seg id="135">"No one can deny that did a great job in the Pilsen that year."</seg>
<seg id="136">"If elected, is likely to continue what we started Ivan Hašek and exchange not significantly the number of staff in the committees."</seg>
<seg id="137">"I do not want to use that to my advantage," assesses Rajchl to their rivals.</seg>

<seg id="5">A book shows where is the best welfare in the water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder made a fact-finding trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be lacking in their luggage, a swimsuits shown.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lying down back on the water, looked the artistic leadership at the top, swam to the marble angelotes, waiting at the edge of the pool with the swimming pool and deck asombraba modernist meticulously restored.</seg>
<seg id="8">He liked the bathroom, noted in his book, when all the interesting details about the style and the history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presented in his recent book "Badefreuden ': Swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest," concrete buildings "in Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Made his "journey for the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The German 46 years is a real fan of the culture of the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wants nothing to do with sport, said Meder, only water is different.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was just upset that fans will have to settle for the blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful trinos of birds in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"One day I wondered why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the head of Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I began collecting fine swimming pools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The surface of the water twice the architecture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The chapoteo in the swimming pool and the ethereal oils in the sauna. The factor of well-being in the swimming pool is so great because it met all the senses, Meder said.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builder strives, indoor swimming pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms are an area of water."</seg>
<seg id="19">"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the building."</seg>
<seg id="20">All bends optically: High vaults, the tiles of colors, the launch pads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides very interesting data in 190 pages on the history of art and architecture in the historic oasis of prosperity, but, above all, one might be tempted to jump to the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Meder, the collector of swimming pools found copies in its investigations in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Along with the excellent use as the bloodbath Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a unique kárstica cavity (bathrooms in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some termas, whose swimming pools are alkaline water and are in a building with a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria have seen dramatic: While the whole city is the eyes in the swimming pool techada of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outside of a swimming pool in St. Anton, and, in the Turkish bath is a window from which can be seen in the ski tracks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The design, perhaps most remarkable expected to customers in Längenfeld: The cathedral is a water Ötztal ovni just land in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Steam rises from three sources open in winter, while in the mountains of Ötztal up in the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the Black Forest Alhambra</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">To Meder, the collector of swimming pools, he invaded the smell of chlorine in swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague of diesel is so strong that people believed to have come to a bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and álcali loam and sticks to the skin into the swimming pool, a welfare benefits in a special way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in their pursuit of beautiful places to the bathroom, discovered when it wanted to go swimming, sunbathing and swimming in the Czech Luhatschowitz, encountered a blocked field.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bathroom in 1902 the architect Jurkovic Duan was closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Meder peeked through the windows of the modernist building desmoronadas red, yellow and white, saw the bushes grow between the tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The decline counterbalance in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: The Termal in Bad Wildbald Palace.</seg>
<seg id="35">The bathrooms have three phases of construction behind; not only can you find elements neorománicos during its construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall style Alhambra, added in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since its thorough modernisation in 1995, the Termal bathing is the favorite of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is a native of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="37">"All credit to merge different architectural styles in a unit so fantastic," said Meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a palace immersion in the swimming pool and spa apparently does not have great importance.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Deutsche Bank looks at the business of raw materials</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">For Christian Teevs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">How Renuncia Deutsche Bank to his business with agricultural raw materials?</seg>
<seg id="5">According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to monitor the impact of speculation for the world's poor.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg,</seg>
<seg id="8">For the public, the matter is clear, according to a survey, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks from speculating in agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of respondents claimed that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it adds to the problems of the poorest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global commodity price increases, and banks are saddled with the responsibility of the problem of world hunger.</seg>
<seg id="13">Consumer advocate's campaign is aimed in particular at Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Originally, the betting on raw materials are thought to protect traders price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The main experts agree that the players have been decoupled from the offers and demands, and make a profit of the costs of the poorest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ackermann responded to the criticism in a different way than the American competitors: Promised to review the claims and said that no business "is compromising the reputation of Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to Spiegel ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims the report of Foodwatch.</seg>
<seg id="18">The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the directive of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann is trying to repair its image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticism of the financial sector, "betting on rising food prices are particularly drastic how ruthless banks harm the public welfare."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann is as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Deutsche Bank should cancel all of its investments in the portfolio that could jeopardize the money for gambling on food prices," said Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">"No matter if Ackermann is the subject of people suffering from hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, Deutsche Bank wrote that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different to what is planned on the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.</seg>
<seg id="29">And needs only interested potential losses, this will be his successor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Two thirds would override the investment in raw materials</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch struggles to keep the pressure on the manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the campaign of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="33">On Tuesday, Bode published the survey by the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only 10 percent considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investment play in food prices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many bank customers showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such business, according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel out all the investment of the money goes to land speculation.</seg>
<seg id="36">The 43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, cancel your account and change to another institution.</seg>

<seg id="5">Now reopened as the home of exhibitions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The modern postgerra passionate about architecture, clear, the halls of glass, the bold curves and new construction materials, typical of thought on technical progress, for which the architect Karl Schwanzer Austrian flag of the 1958 Brussels and provides a good example.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Pavilion of Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture for his slight and floating construction of steel and glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">The well-known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary four cylinders to MBW tower over the adjacent building aplanado in Munich, became internationally known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten alongside the station south of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century, was called the "house 20."</seg>
<seg id="12">The building was adequate but lacked the proper technology and space for a museum; no wall to hang art, not a good atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite that was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.</seg>
<seg id="14">The building is empty since 2001 and lapses increasingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the flag, now called "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday afternoon, opened the museum belvedere, who owns the house, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, was a new beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, doctorate in history of art with a considerable career, among other things, artistic patinadora on ice in his youth, later at Sotheby, the founder and director of the Guggenheim museum of modern art museum in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the exception of contemporary art, are the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba name of the foundation, there should be a cafe and a bookstore and built an office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict control, budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because reformed so sensitive the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded and was awarded the contract, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a "huge and important place," which was "almost every weekend" exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for use with generosity and easily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "a devorador of energy," said Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">It changed the profile of the windows of the facade of glass, a glass reinforced with fiberglass insulation and remplazó the glass ceiling for a special safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">The thermal bridges and reinforced steel beams or remplazaron and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light falling between the house and the street lighting, a bridge to enter the building almost new, but still the flag of Schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in shades old mahogany and protected against oxidation.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is exactly as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all this with a strict control of the office of monuments and a low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often had to find material that was good, cheap and also would like to the office for the protection of monuments," says Krischanitz and warned of a harsh in the basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building is flexible and slight.</seg>
<seg id="33">The flag "who came to Brussels" has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "appearance by chance in the history of the city."</seg>
<seg id="34">An architecture that is "always in the wrong place," and that is why I wanted to "raise awareness appropriate."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, a stroke of luck. The entirely new and planned "district of the central police station," with homes and offices, along with the Schweizer Garten.</seg>
<seg id="36">And it may be another stroke of luck: The house 21 could receive a strengthening of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary art hall Berlin and, as you hear, is negotiating with the city on a neighbor in the Schweizer Garten.</seg>

<seg id="1">The threat is</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell," the Turkish media have doubts about the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper spoke of a "bloody ideology" that is to be revived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The killings of eight small entrepreneurs tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin reacted with fear and concern about this news.</seg>
<seg id="6">For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost who were believed dead for some time, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, had not happened more episodes of violence with far-right background against Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, it has never been questioned in Germany is xenophobia.</seg>
<seg id="8">The far-right discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not far from predictable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"Again to reignite the bloody ideology?", called the Turkish newspaper's online edition "Haberturk."</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper Sabah "stresses that, on the contrary, one of the authors of the crime was an informant for the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the pantanal far-right.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with German politicians and Turkish reflected in a solemn ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German Turk.</seg>
<seg id="13">Life was on the scene with gaudy colours, as a story with a happy ending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The information came to some Turkish media as a slap in the face, "the German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article in the Turkish platform of the Internet, "Haber X," referring to the background of the string of murders.</seg>
<seg id="15">The German broadcasting "Hürriyet" nor insists chart this connection.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It starts to smell bad," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that those killed were people who pay their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and its subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.</seg>
<seg id="19">The authors have been amazed that the German authorities have not sought long before suspects in the circle of the far right.</seg>
<seg id="20">One is the less drastic rhetoric in the media: "From now on we lost, immigrants have no more than self-defense and weapons."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This will be the best self-protection."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Germany's domestic peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network.", writes "Selen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Which means that, if the domestic peace of Germany is in danger of attacks and Solingen Mölln will be clarified in 90 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been etched in the memories of German and Turkish.</seg>
<seg id="25">No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat, and the Germans, who mistrust and distance can lead to violence.</seg>
<seg id="26">The attacks underscore the sense of group of the Turkish side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not to repeat the mistakes of the past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the Turkish press was criticized then mainly the weakness of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit survivors of Mölln.</seg>
<seg id="29">Following the attack with a fire in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, its foreign minister, replacing him at the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech which contribute taxes the Turks in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is unclear how it is estimated the value of a person according to the amount of taxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The Turkish media present information to show how deep it is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition to the efforts of an explanation and a revaluation of the terrorism of the extreme right in Germany, this time frank words are needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">The bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The bank more risky in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis, and since then has slipped through from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now runs a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Sure that Axel Weber had not thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his dramatic departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July that he would begin in 2013 in a new and almost equally spectacular job: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber is pleased publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for his new-found strength and slipped kind remarks about his future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The USB has achieved a revitalization."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am pleased to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.</seg>
<seg id="11">A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Oswald Grübel, general manager of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The president of the administrative council of the USB was considered since then also touched on, and all asked: When is Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It was also learned that Weber will advise the bank since February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will take over the chairmanship of the administrative council in May, not the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is hard to Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and director and has had a period of adjustment is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coup is responsible for the strategy of the bank, which has just returned to prove that deserves the title "scandal, the biggest bank in Europe" for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the USB is enormous, was until recently the largest global asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, slipped to a scandal to the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, it saves the once so proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the Swiss property manager discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the one hand, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages money for wealthy clients more than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on the other hand, advanced as investment bank in the league of the big banks in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This impressive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hans Geiger, the former banker and professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "To my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank."</seg>
<seg id="28">"From today's point of view, one question: How could it be wrong?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Was in a big mistake.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong in the USB.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general manager, which until then was regarded as a brilliant banker and very intelligent, resigned unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, it was suspected.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fund's investment bank embarked on losses in high-risk securities and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To cope with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">For this found investors, of course, some look with contempt until shortly before: A state fund Asia and opaque of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that she had never heard his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative board, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, continued the disaster, in view of their wrong investments, UBS was found in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">The national bank bought distressed at the multibillion-dollar UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which became co-owners of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">All of Switzerland was affected, said that this was the dramatic for a small country, if accommodated such large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland (see chart).</seg>
<seg id="43">"We cannot go back to rescue the UBS," said Geiger, an expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster joined the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was ready to hand over data of wealthy clients, which may have disappointed taxes with the help of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, approved a $780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted profits of these businesses with compensation for payment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">With that, the UBS admitted more or less have helped in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time lost something that was always their capital in the competition for wealthy clients: The aura of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board and the president of the administrative council.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of funds from customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two key areas: In investment banking by erroneous speculation and the administration of goods through the help of fiscal fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when he came to be a little more relaxed, just when it was thought that the UBS returned to achieve this, this wretched history of the operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realised that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it was revealed, apparently, that still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With the case Adoboli states that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that dominates the risk controls."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers who turned up for a long time, be the guardians of the world's greatest assets: No too great a risk to the safety of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">Security deposits in Swiss banks were the symbol of reliability unwavering, such as Lindt chocolate Sprüngli and genuine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The core of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the buzz of the strong Swiss private bank, is only a little higher.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow covered summits in the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Here are shops like Tiffany's between business and the traditional Swiss Sprüngli confectionery.</seg>
<seg id="64">Here are the Swiss banks for years: From the national bank, through the palace of Credit Suisse, until the private banks as Julius Bär elitarios.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Within the walls are lined with marble, here are large leather armchairs, along with the bank's logo is a great sign to indicate the "safety".</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer wants here: Security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have pushed the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as is the president of a small Swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, as all Swiss bankers, also with the business of the two big banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS has become too big, believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.</seg>
<seg id="71">That the Swiss had nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And have been used for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">In fact, the investment bank UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon, delivered his first major profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost so much money in the jungle of high risk as the great Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The 15 October 2008, the disaster was clear.</seg>
<seg id="75">"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" (" The crash of the UBS "in Spanish).</seg>
<seg id="76">Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billions of euros to save the big bank bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How it happens?</seg>
<seg id="78">Talks with Swiss bankers, see the problem in the size of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge in a powerful consortium.</seg>
<seg id="80">There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">So it was that the two banks, but the precursors of UBS, a bank rich but asleep in the heart of the administration of goods in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the investment banks internationalized arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could make a great bike.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">There are two names associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative board.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says the banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, that meant a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that Dvurechye re-scramble from learning in the bank until the summit."</seg>
<seg id="86">Finally, Ospel Wuffli trusted what they told them.</seg>
<seg id="87">And in the end, Wuffli was probably a fatal error: "Thought that their models were a reality," says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"It is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: The attempt came before the event.</seg>
<seg id="91">UBS employees clearly remember leadership meetings, Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Down to the throne to Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank investment bank was the most powerful in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">Leading the "League Tables," rankings then documented the success of the banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">The UBS wanted to be at the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps he went well.</seg>
<seg id="96">In currency trading and trading in shares was higher.</seg>
<seg id="97">However, the business advisers responsible highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest in the language of banks' fixed income, "there is a huge compensation for the big banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill the gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Eager for growth, invested so much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in American investment.</seg>
<seg id="101">Was transformed into a powerful machine to securitize mortgages and sell them to American, maintaining certain risks to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="102">And also, as other banks sought the fall for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="103">"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, an expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">So great euphoria, so deep the fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager had to leave because the attempt to order was more complicated than expected.</seg>
<seg id="106">The posts in the UBS became proyectables seats and unsafe to the present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Currently, who runs a large bank, has a nearly impossible.</seg>
<seg id="108">Must find a strategy for a bank, in which all the logical business models are lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, focus on the administration of goods, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">The bank does not want to go so far (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment bank should reduce much, it is clear today.</seg>
<seg id="112">The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="113">In fact, it was only in the italiano-suizo 51 years as a transitional solution, as the bank, the bank left surprisingly Grübel of his predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="114">In the meantime, he imposed: Should lead permanently business of UBS, reported the bank in Zurich on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its rule in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">Deletes 3,500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But this is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is?</seg>
<seg id="120">What it wants to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that Axel Weber is safe.</seg>
<seg id="122">So far only said that first will seek a house with his wife in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The next year.</seg>

<seg id="2">In many places the grajos are considered "birds problematic ": These are not expelled inteligentísimos animals in cities for a long time, say experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">About love, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulate complaints from neighbors in the dirt and noise of the animals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Although there has been no way against the "birds problematic" until now.</seg>
<seg id="5">The grajos no longer out of the cities, say experts in the first symposium on grajos in Read, East Friesland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The specialists from around the country to discuss possible solutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Looking for alternatives in cities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Environmentalists attributed the problems of migration from the countryside to the cities of certain grajos protected; chemical applications in agriculture are visibly with the traditional habitat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hunting, the growing construction and falling trees that the hospedan made life difficult for birds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The grajos are protected.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as Read.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 2005, came to the negative headlines in the press a controversial project to kill grajos en masse to the district.</seg>
<seg id="13">Critics have described the hunting of the animals through traps for birds and murder with sticks as especially brutal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Throwing and ahuyentándolos normally do not get anything," said Werner Klöver, urbanista and landscape gardener to Read.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fire with water to the nests or throw the trees are often unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, an expert on environment of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Stray animals, the large colonies of divide and distributed in other places."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Ahuyentarlos is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have to live with them, no longer the atrapamos."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without the surroundings, will not solve the problem in cities, said Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Read.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is possible to a combination of driving away the animals in residential areas and sensitive baits to return to settle elsewhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Information panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and against etnóloga advertised in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a peak in the face with aplomb."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Jürgens cofounded in Schleswig-Holstein circuit on the education of grajos Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of the intelligent birds.</seg>
<seg id="23">Meanwhile, the project is accepted by the tourists.</seg>

<seg id="10">"The beauty and the pain of the battle" combines the experience in times of war more or less 20 men and women Ordinarias, on both sides of the war, and a botanical colegialas escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people will become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some will become prisoners of war, or lose its members, will be mad or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives here as parpadean votivas candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix, while others apagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book by Mr Englund is a departure from the standard history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was the only fatal trench warfare on the western front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: The Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives; one is the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is a book moving, almost from the start.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war has flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordita.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you're a woman who is at home with your children, there or huyes?</seg>
<seg id="21">Anyway, who is?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one understands what is happening, or even for what it takes to fight this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Lack of facts," said Mr Englund, "has been filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor fleet on the high seas.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories have been made mostly of memoirs, letters and other material already published earlier.</seg>
<seg id="26">The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more alive in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, Mr Englund.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of these are about deprivation and make do with what we have.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tell the story of German schoolgirl says: "Substitutes, substitutes for all parties."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ersatz coffee, aluminium false, rubber and paper masks, wooden buttons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Still talking about the food substitute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">Described as "meat made from rice cooked in fat and pressing carnero (and topped off with a false bone made of wood); tobacco parings of roots and dried potatoes; shoes with soles of wood."</seg>
<seg id="32">There are, he noted, "837 permitted substitutes in the production of meat sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are about the honor and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American acknowledges its own momentum towards the savagery and is about the war, "You feel that, after all, this is what the men are designed not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretend that this means veneer and that there is no civilization behind this barbaric and tachonada pechera almidonada."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">A British soldier realizes that probably will die, and that no one will notice or will.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once you resign themselves to the thought of, one would like to think that could happen in front of the public," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">On the other hand, is horribly similar "to a convicted being strangled in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">It reflects the arrival of what he called "a new breed of young bestiario in the century: The mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with good clothes and clothing that executes its carnage is sitting behind a desk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who attempted to actively take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of avoiding the service in the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The most grotesque of this can be seen up trade gonocócico, soldiers and buy embadurnan with their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Those who are truly desperate and looking forward to their eyes, which often leads to a blind for life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of Swedish made by Peter Grave, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to the task.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to "exceptionally uncontrollable forces unleashed: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."</seg>
<seg id="47">People are beginning to ask why their leaders are doing to combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as Without novelty in the face of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive histories.</seg>
<seg id="49">The volume of Mr Englund joins a pantheon unconventional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book is one of the most devastating late that I can remember in a work of fiction.</seg>
<seg id="51">I will not.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if it had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned with a match.</seg>

<seg id="1">After a false step, a planned assault at the minute</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.</seg>
<seg id="3">They chose the night of Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.</seg>
<seg id="4">The operation was held in secret, except for a few senior officers, saying initially that others were joining a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre, their presence underlined how the operation had infested of challenges to the police department.</seg>
<seg id="6">They could not be repeated episodes of recent weeks, as the espray pepper spray on the protesters, in violation of the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And that is why the police operation to clear the protesters Zuccotti Park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.</seg>
<seg id="8">The officers were prepared to watch as they had developed occupations in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="9">A greater disaster drill was taking place at Randalls Island, with one eye looking to Zuccotti.</seg>
<seg id="10">The officers increased training of disorder - counter-terrorism measures that involve moving quickly to a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The last training session was on Monday night, in the side of the East River in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="12">The orders to enter the park came at the last minute, "said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as" an exercise. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"The few polis I know that were called for this, they said it was to enter the Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 14 October, officers wanted to clear the park, but had discontinued when hundreds of demonstrators came out ahead of time after hearing about the plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces throughout the borough - dozens of mobile operators commonly used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Mr Kelly said that many people, including those who travel daily to work, had been bounced back and forth in the park during the day, making the 1 a.m. a good time to enter.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It was appropriate to do so when it was the lowest number of people in the park," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with pockets and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.</seg>
<seg id="21">The lights and pre-recorded messages from the loudspeakers that retumbaban seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="22">Community affairs officers were at the park with its clear blue wind breaker, many protesters simply picked up his things and left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">There was no shop until 1: 45 a.m., said police, giving time for the protesters to gather their belongings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Journalists in the park were forced to leave.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said that it was for their safety.</seg>
<seg id="27">But many journalists said they tried to avoid that see the police action in the park, and that they had been treated rudely by agents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Browne said that the mobile television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As the police moved westward through the dense thicket of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic full of clothes, teams from the Department of Clean-up followed them, picking up what was left behind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Some protesters who refused to move were washed out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="31">A core group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp was candaron between them for the arms.</seg>
<seg id="34">And two people were chained to trees, said Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="35">The emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">No arrests were made in the park until about 3: 30 a.m., said Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="37">The operation was complete cleared of about 75 minutes later, police said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Mr Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.</seg>
<seg id="39">Most of the arrests were for "disturbing the public order and resisting authority," he said.</seg>
<seg id="40">The senior officer at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officer in the department.</seg>
<seg id="41">Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department, was also there.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Kelly, while he was present, "was not conducting operations," said Mr Browne.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">A second group of players expected along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There were barricades in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.</seg>
<seg id="45">Since those positions, was to the police to expand the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.</seg>
<seg id="46">At one point, a number of players, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people outside.</seg>
<seg id="47">There were some 28 people in the north.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Some of the most vocal of the night took place south of the park.</seg>
<seg id="49">Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking away the air of the wheels of a police van.</seg>
<seg id="50">At one point, a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the end, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The workers' union will require support from the city by layoffs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Demand is, perhaps, the ultimate weapon available to the union, the borough 37, in its effort to repeal the dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred seventy and two aides of the school, the coordinators of parents and others who were among the worst paid in the city lost its work on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political vendetta by his refusal to allow the spring, access on the part of the city to a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Municipal authorities have strongly denied the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing in the city last month, the director of education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the Council contraatacó saying that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school support staff would be laid off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Officials of the borough 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that would be sued. They held a press conference on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers made redundant as plaintiffs, all of them black or Hispanic women, like the majority of people who lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft of the complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, who had been subsidized chronically underfunded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It said that while there was no redundancies in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a wealthy suburb of parents to raise funds to cover the budget deficit."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P.D. The budget District 36 fell 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrollment by poor in schools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The union also claims that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, despite the fact that "surplus" describes the act of moving to a master of the payroll of a school in a bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"Sixty-six coordinators of parents were laid off," says the draft of the complaint, "and not only in surplus."</seg>

<seg id="1">Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="3">All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed and the participation of the United States came to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by the chairman John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, along with Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding Libyans for his successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is to honour the brave of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, lawmakers of both parties fought among themselves and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and that never came to be voted on in the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for US operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">That left the US mission in a kind of purgatory of legislation - with Congress sufficiently disturbing to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as to actually take the rug out from under their feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Then, the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now the Senate could be ready to act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for his tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "pays tribute to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary courage and professionalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also "states the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new measure Ganará has the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divided lawmakers as the bill in June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top Republican on the committee.</seg>
<seg id="21">A spokesman for Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all the congressional Republicans and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject to a vote of the full assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other lawmakers have not succeeded so far to get their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are duplicates - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially Republicans job seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of the measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can meet, while the representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of New York), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.</seg>

<seg id="33">An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as banning the burning of flags.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="35">So enthusiastic that have been members to propose amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 111º Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and made 66 in the 110th.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Beaten but not defeated," Giffords said in his first interview since the shooting on TV</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range at a constituent event in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona appeared on national television Monday night, sang to the tune of Broadway, "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said that he wanted to recover more of what I wanted to return to Congress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In his appearance on ABC News "20 / 20," with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought for prayers and needed help to walk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The programme documented his difficult path back to the damage caused by a bullet that he fractured his skull and broke through the left side of his brain, and that step from the front to the back of his head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Three months ago, he was taken aback by the House to cast their ballots, triumphant in the agreement of the debt ceiling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, rio and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41 years, he replied: "Quite well."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program "20 / 20" an hour in length, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.</seg>
<seg id="10">In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, it is seen in his hospital bed, his head shaved beards and a long scar across his face.</seg>
<seg id="11">It can only have one or two fingers erguidos, while her husband encouraged.</seg>

<seg id="14">Fruncimiento of the lips.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then, his first word: "What."</seg>
<seg id="16">In a few days, Giffords delivered another word - "tostada," a request for a change in its breakfast menu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: Sees the congressman singing along with the therapists songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="19">Her husband said he was leyéndole to Giffords a newspaper article about the killing of 12 March when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who were killed in the incident.</seg>
<seg id="20">The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is being forcibly medication while awaiting trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Many people died," he said Giffords to Sawyer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hard, hard, hard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of recovery of his wife, she said: "I have been defeated."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"So, I said, 'Gabby, it has not been defeated,'" said Kelly.</seg>

<seg id="19">They also realize that anger faced by troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a result, most of the talks on the pity is carried out in silence and in private between war veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">After his two sons returned to fight with the Marine Corps, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned that people apart from the military would consider its service from two perspectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Some mirarían them with a sense of fear that clashed with insurgents and traveled to exotic locations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Others wonder whether there would be a "veteran not-completely-free and violent beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of government in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">During his job search, he said, he felt that some members had asked politely if it would be able to stand up under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"When you talk about your service, you need to address the negative impressions," recalled Cancian contándoselo to their children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The concern arises, in part, of the American indifference towards the wars.</seg>
<seg id="27">The gains on the battlefield are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"We, as a nation, we no longer military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In contrast, the praise of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.</seg>
<seg id="30">The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The army is facing increasing pressure to end the violation</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 men and women have a case against the army for its alleged failure to rape.</seg>
<seg id="3">If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are planned for the next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy night in which she said that she was raped by a colleague.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was October 2008, and was on his way back to their barracks in the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met with a colleague who was carrying a package of 12 cans of beer.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked if he could join her in his room to take a drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Sounded an alarm," said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the native Texas set aside their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought, no, has 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is in Texas," he says.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I wish I had listened to my instincts."</seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes into the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, tirándola down and raping her, he claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel anxiously await a decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they filed against the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the widespread violation of the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., initially implied demand to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them say they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assault.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke said that goes to the top brass of the army, because the problem begins with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The army is a top-down structure," he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also said that since February, have been in touch with her about 400 survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands.</seg>
<seg id="20">His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak, is going to present a number of cases, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by the federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed the defence strategy, in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a ruling by the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the personnel on active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged damage are part of the military service of the plaintiffs," according to the documents.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">While women are still officially banned from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars are rarely clear the front lines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially for local women in war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: Between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time that the army is also modernized, says Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She is not alone in its fight, and three other demands are in place, as well as his.</seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic for is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic.</seg>
<seg id="33">On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a complaint against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to give them the high of service -- a common occurrence, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network Service, a human rights group.</seg>
<seg id="34">His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discrimination in the way it handles complaints of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There have been nine separate bills in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, there were 3.158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, that figure at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 incidents that occurred this year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report, published in March, also examines the indices: In 2010, a 20 percent of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that in the civil justice system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described the attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the case of Lyman, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.</seg>
<seg id="41">That night, he said, he was asked to disclose the details of its violation 11 times different from a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker - a cut in its brazo- was found in his bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people testified as a character witness in the name of the suspect, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day when was read out the verdict," said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought I was going to go to work, I found myself screaming from the room."</seg>
<seg id="47">"I was in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember that I told my commanding officer," This is not a trial. This was my opinion. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman was ordered to pay a visit to a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed with a personality disorder, which did not fit for service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010 was dispensed menos-que-honorables under terms of service, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, said John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington Law School.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, he said, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."</seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.</seg>
<seg id="53">I have been a critic of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence of responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He added: "The odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try."</seg>
<seg id="56">These things only change when the good people is ready to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the hearing is not on the road, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, will be in line with its hundreds of other applicants for future cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We are going to continue to fight against the army in this issue until the reform will take place," he says.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Or until we muramos, what happens first.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another kind that aireaba anti-immigration views online.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from being alone in cyberspace: Had spent most of the time that preceded the attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how to find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy - you have to go on Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on the populism of the European digital DEMOS British think tank.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cache of personal information on Facebook is so enciclopédico, said Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that sellers have been using for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team found half a million Bartlett fan of the right-wing groups across Europe and then I went announcements, but instead of a new band or vincularles product of diet, advertisements inviting users to complete a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to look at more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a whole new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of the right-wing groups tend to be young men and angry about immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, in a kind of turning point, "those who combine his activism in line with the offline activism is more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research centers, medical researchers and scientists, politicians are using the site to study everything from health problems for social trends as expressed in the "likes" messages and updates on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, "supernova data" Facebook is fueling a boom in research, pushing the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title until nearly 800 percent in the past five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">To some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it enables you to look at the people that you could not acercarte with a file on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Before, when intentabas survey of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You go through the party, and they would never get access," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook removes all this - you go to them directly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the problems of salud-social.</seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, found that college students who spoke of their feats of binge drinking on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with the drink that students who remained silent on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suggests that the fellow students, such as residential advisers could monitor the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of state with their drinking.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can't deal with a problem if you can diagnose," said Dimitri Christakis, a co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Conduct and Child Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook is also constantly "tapped" to his own people to obtain data.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Team of the site has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of turnout in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness index (mainly using the information accessible - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should be available to other large amount of data for research).</seg>
<seg id="29">However, Facebook users know that the site is watching, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice on the power play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the site undermine your personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey that do not even know?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect their data offline and online is a free lunch for all.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not think that many users have thought even in the fact that an investigator could be looking at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a 2006 study carried out with the walls of public Facebook students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"As far as they were concerned, it was only between themselves and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a subject of this investigation being completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information to a user's profile and the messages of the wall are true.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," said Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles and a pen remain the best research tools that anyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"There is no substitute for the real world and talk to real people," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of social still happens offline."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik made his first public appearance in court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of the "resistance" during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Caballeros Templarios of Norway," he said to a room filled with 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I am opposed to the court, which received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I acknowledge the facts but I plead guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech written in advance, go to the families of their victims at the end of the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, denied access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to keep a tight rein on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it is kept under lock and key.</seg>
<seg id="11">All were with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I thought that seemed cold and inhuman," said one survivor of Utoya enough to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes when it entered and left the building.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik of being part of a movement of "resistance", the judge ruled that it is not a mental illness, and said that there is no evidence that acted as accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is possible that some are some comfort that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a radical group.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that does not automatically qualifies the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I would like to see it a monster, but it seems to be," said a relative of a victim.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would be much easier if it seems."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 Lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, are in a theater this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Inventor Modern.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what the fan of Apple could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently discovered anew that has been dusted and advancement of a series of special screenings in the largest markets this week, is how much this meant creative minds about business processes and work flows of products.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but it was also a meticulous and an organizer of the flow diagrams yonki - a man who believed that many executives were "a disease that is a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the nerds (The triumph of the idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for a long and rare conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time, barely 10 years had passed since that Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and we worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of the interview was used in Cringely nerds, said that the original interview disappeared during transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was only after the death of Jobs discovered a full copy on VHS in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This archival material, slightly reprinted, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, 68 minutes, at Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And very very surprised.</seg>
<seg id="12">In four different points along the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is weighing clearly their thoughts, looking for accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also times when the perfectionism of Jobs goes to the surface, where it seems impatient because of questions of Cringely, empujándole to move faster towards the issues and arguments of greater importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic interview in The Lost, when Jobs assesses what is that other companies are right and wrong, and offers its own vision of the future of computing.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to read posthumous assessments of the race of Jobs, but there is something in the Jobs crude and inspiring to see here, the dreamer eager to the brink of greatness.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things can and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Not long after this all out here, and it did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of seven major sequences of The Lost interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">On how he learned to lead a business:</seg>
<seg id="20">"Over the years in the business, I always wondered:" Why do you do things? "And you cannot get the answers that are invariably:" Oh, that is just the way it is. "</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, in business, no one thinks things very deeply.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify accounting for Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Taken aback by the way - costs were often starting with a "cost" standard that was as a rule of thumb, and then followed with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that claimed that could determine the retail business costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On the joke the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs recounts the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people hackear effectively the telephone company and to make free long-distance calls.</seg>
<seg id="27">Much has been written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">Describes how he and Wozniak proved the box through the use of a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from a network of AT & T, while creating a loop with the largest number of satellites as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and gritabas through the public telephone and a minute later the public phone next door," says Jobs with a risita.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">The two of us, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant - was a lesson is incredible, and I do not believe that Apple would never have existed without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs is describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asked to speak with the Pope, as did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the Pope himself was excited to go to answer the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On fall in love with technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years, to the hunt for spare parts to build a meter often sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and I made a call.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"That was a great influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what it was and how well a company trying to their employees."</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the employees of HP who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made."</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen catódico tube, and I enamoré of him.</seg>
<seg id="40">Would a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with this machine and would write programs for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To improvise innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">At several points in the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the way.</seg>
<seg id="43">Early in his career, which was devoted to sell a handful of plates, a customer asked him if he could get the whole team.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, while he was at Apple, recalls the struggles they faced in the development of a computer mouse.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember having arguments dramatic... I shouted that it would take five years to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer.</seg>
<seg id="47">90 days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On big companies losing strength:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before that lead to the rebirth of Apple, Jobs prophetically foresaw the way in which many industry leaders tropezarían in his vision, and would lose control of its market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I gave that trabajas in IBM and Xerox, for what you do best copiers and printers, and what?"</seg>
<seg id="51">You have a monopoly of the market share, as the company has no more success.</seg>
<seg id="52">The increase in sales and marketing departments, which are the kind of people who end up leading companies and products are removed from the forum for decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius of the products that led to the monopoly position it rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the skills necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">That is what happened in Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox could have hijacked the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">Could have been 10 times its size, it could have been the Microsoft in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="57">Took the defeat of the victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The innovation and artistic expression:</seg>
<seg id="59">"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it develops the big idea, changing and growing."</seg>
<seg id="60">Learn a lot about the subtleties of the same.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that you can't do that make electrons, glass makes them, the robots, the factories.</seg>
<seg id="62">You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fit all the time...</seg>
<seg id="63">In the end it all comes down to taste -- exponerte was reduced to try to better than a human team has done, and then try to adapt these things that you're doing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas cenan with opponents of the health care law while the court accepted the case</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue politically controversial whether they would accept the challenge to the law of President Obama's health care, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will set out the case before the high court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered in a preliminary hearing to consider carefully the requests for review.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases in question was a petition filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed to admit trámite demand and, in fact, is expected to be a historic plea for five and a half hours in March, and the result probably will further muddy the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time of the court's decision is known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be scrapped will probably be Paul Clement, who served as US attorney general during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has for many years devoted to the defence of the conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among those attending were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Party more important in the Senate and an opponent of the health care law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it is not something that comes into conflict with the ethical standards.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If it were, it could be said that fall under the Code of Canon 4C, which says: "A judge can attend events to raise funds for organizations and other related to the law, but the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of this event."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges in the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Causa Común).</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges were agasajados at a fund-raising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."</seg>
<seg id="20">His appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that too easily mixed with the court's work agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thomas and his wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the Justice Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration when it filed the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance.</seg>
<seg id="25">His critics have pushed for Kagan refrain from watching the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law to now be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan has not given any indication that he will do.</seg>

<seg id="3">Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a transaction valued at more than $1 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it is a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft amounted to a record of $18 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, a gold mine in aircraft orders for future growth.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will require 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Boeing announced over the weekend its biggest-ever asked for commercial aircraft in dollar terms - 50 Boing 777 jets double corridor.</seg>
<seg id="9">The successful asked wine in Dubái Emirates airline.</seg>
<seg id="10">The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total sale price of $26 billion, Boeing announced in the Air Dubái in 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, known as the Dreamliner, which boasts a fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"This is clearly a huge positive impact for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The quality of these clients in particular is very strong."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Many airlines in the Middle East are the property of their oil producing nations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"They have a natural protection," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The order of the Emirates solidifies leadership of Boeing in the market for wide-bodied aircraft and helps to keep at bay the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade their dominance with the A350 airliner.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his candidacy for governor of violence during the elections of Michoacan state, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of his opponents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state of Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, it is alarming, not only for Miachoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">"They threatened to our candidates, our electoral workers... It took to the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favour of the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.</seg>
<seg id="9">The PRI has hope of winning the presidential election in July.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Vallejo appears to have overtaken by little room to Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.</seg>
<seg id="11">Calderon, a conservative candidate of the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the left divided and unhappy before the 2012 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the home state of President Calderon, Michoacan and he chose to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">The ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term that would prevent the growth of the Asian economies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat Nag, director general of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to speed up the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">He warned against the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China] watching the difficulties of Europe in a "fair" and said that the Asian financial assistance with the leadership and European resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are all in this together."</seg>
<seg id="6">"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."</seg>
<seg id="8">"So if China and India can help, that is by all means."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that could push the global economy into recession and has led to calls for the major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone to find a solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for the Asian partners in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Anand Sharma, the Indian minister of commerce, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"No one wants the eurozone remains unstable and troubled," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help the wealthy Europeans when faced with their own and deep economic problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the University of Brown in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"At some point you will realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why Indian reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-making as the railways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to "significant knock-on effects" throughout Asia.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 now faces the "downside risks" due to the threat of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows of their economies.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic cuts looming budget could undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, civilian assembly lines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is already digesting the 450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now he fears a further reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping", would lead to a 23 percent of global reductions and a great many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"A cut of this size, this applied indiscriminately, would make most of our naval and construction projects could not be carried out - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other efforts to modernize," Panetta wrote to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We would be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily, and due to the reduction would be so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to give civilians in order to meet the goal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes would break faith with those who are seriously harm our army and the readiness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts would be to the combat troops, Panetta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"While funding for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations are not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis," Panetta said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract that supports the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to vendors in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the main military power in the world."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening, when published the letter to Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is not a result that can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to happen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the letter to Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly vocal about the possible cuts, despite the fact that came to a job at the top of the Pentagon budget with years of experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that faced difficult decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In a press conference last week, Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a brigade without bullets."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is an air wing without sufficient pilots trained."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a force that is suffering from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with the potential adversaries."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In fact, invites aggression..."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provides new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: Delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limited our ability to be deployed and committed throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">The list includes the warplane F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicles for the Army and the Navy need replacing, the humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Stop the development and testing of the F35 could generate an additional $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that is the next vital step to improve and deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">A look at the most recent headlines indicates how serious and pervasive are the deception and lies in everyday life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading accusations of sexual harassment with several women, each side accused the other of lying.</seg>
<seg id="4">The trustees of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports saying that a retired football coach was sexually abusing children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with an open microphone saying the US president, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The congressman from New York and exhibicionista on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his denials quickly rebatidos by the irrefutable proof.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of wrongdoing in the financing of the campaign in connection with the cover-up of an extra-marital affair.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, again, no one who lived will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton during his second term by lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the legends are widespread cheating on tests of school and university.</seg>
<seg id="11">There have been cases in which teachers have given the answers from the tests to students in order to be best seen in their assessments of performance.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mentors who should be taught otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much deception we?</seg>
<seg id="14">On any given day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.</seg>
<seg id="15">That sure, many of these lies are white lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that the unknown cheating three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we need to acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the aim is to say: 'You have, "the detection of deception is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lies have been rebatidos.</seg>
<seg id="20">The liars do look in the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Do not always tartamudean, balbucean, ruborizan or uneasy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We cannot conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and expose.</seg>
<seg id="23">A polygraph can be trained to learn the truth about the structure of the declaration, the expressions microfaciales, training and the times.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries about the deception in the vast and growing body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate the complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and felt intuitively how others perceive them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know from research that the extrovertidos lie more introverted, that men are more "lies aimed at themselves," while women say more lies "aimed at the other" -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners to people who are not married, but the lies that often say they tend to be "huge ").</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How do you know if someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, look at the usual behaviour of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is called "to create a baseline."</seg>
<seg id="31">To provide benchmarks to measure after the changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Look at the position of the subject, laughter and vocal feature.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is better to know if someone usually golpetea with the foot all the time not to make accusations unfair when I see the golpeteando feet in the middle of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then, look for groups of deceptive behavior, verbal and non-verbal.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as evidence of deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember their history, they can move their feet to the door, lean toward an exit, changing its position significantly or wear a "comfort postentrevista" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the hard questions are over.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interrogators often falsely imply that the interview was over, only to find that relief postentrevista.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">It also draws attention to the vocabulary of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">Scott Peterson got the leg to the bottom and used the past tense as he claimed that his wife killed was alive, launching a search for it at the national level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">People who cheat can also use a language distanciador: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in full.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal indicators are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Anyone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when a difficult question to answer: "Well... to tell the truth... so what I was... in my view."</seg>
<seg id="43">This means that the answer is a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover the deception is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.</seg>

<seg id="1">The economy slowed down climate adversity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, foreign investment and the economy contracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-styled of change, which fuelled expectations with regard to developments in the economy, but given the adversity climate for the beginning of the year, there was no sign of growth, but there has been a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.</seg>
<seg id="4">The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of dollars in losses to the agricultural sector, limited the scope of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic collapse of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the report of damage by frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, had damage to 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which the total 78.03 percent suffered damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the victims were the main crops of vegetables, corn and garbanzo.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifaceted, the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the School of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, in terms of the actions that have been made public policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a restriction of resources for the legislation that was passed in the Congress to combat money laundering, $grab for the people who illegally it is not easy to get to work, and used to invest in something," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Migration arrested</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Lopez Cervantes said that the increase in unemployment, there is also a factor.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The number of people who are going to the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because moving also have great difficulty in finding work, that people are falling and is demanding jobs here in the state, which means that unemployment rises," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Informal sector</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The analysis of the labour market sinaloense is compounded when considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the working population in the state work without being paid as an employee with no social security institution.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's working behind the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.</seg>
<seg id="16">The average monthly income of workers sinaloenses was, until September, 5 352 billion pesos, well below the national average, located in 7 375 billion pesos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of FDI contraction</seg>
</p>

<seg id="19">For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounted for a total investment of $17 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the service sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Before the stage of economic contraction, the government of the state requested state congress in July to the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, which would be for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a total of 2, 000 600 million pesos, and until November have not seen the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The replacement of digital to analog signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional challenges filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree of the so-called "analogue switch-off" from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes needed to overturn it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, found that President Felipe Calderon is not overstepped its authority by issuing the decree detailing the actions to make the transition to digital terrestrial television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate, was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality of the decree inconstitucionalidad or, and this is in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The ruling, issued by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, because the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of reserve and hierarchical subordination of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Voted in favour of the draft only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives promoted two constitutional challenges to challenge the decree, and to accept the demands, the minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions as he prepared for the digital transition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The ministers decided to dismiss the case brought by the House of Representatives, without going to the discussion of the draft, also in charge of the minister Sanchez Cordero.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In his speech, the Prime Minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general measures to prepare the public service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Nor do I believe that if it did it would affect the independence of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector for the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate, rector of the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The replacement of digital to analog signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Postponing the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digital technology, which involves a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "which covers economic, social, political and national security."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the system established under the principle of economic stewardship of the state, including a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the executive power of the state."</seg>

<seg id="1">Will be on Wednesday, the new Italian government</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The appointed prime minister of Italy, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has jeopardized the entire eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that can form a government.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume the post.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said that the president will present the results of their talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti did not say explicitly that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"The framework is now painted," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the volatility of the markets posted the bond yields on 10-year Italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, the Italian employers, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot to this government."</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy out of this state of emergency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success of Monti were driven substantially by the support of the ruling LDP of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to have a good result," he told the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because, until now, many of its members were opposed to the government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.</seg>
<seg id="20">Any block or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian association of foreign banks are added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began on Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as women's and youth organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Will put an end to his round of meetings on Tuesday night.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has made a transition extremely quickly in response to the crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief respite at the end of the week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now turned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians only give it time to implement the reforms before early elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti has said that he would like to include in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that must be formed only by technicians, an indication of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources said that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">He assured the downward and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The group is in the South American wing of his tour of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will be their only scale in Central America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7: 30 p. m., along with the band angelina The X and nationals of The Robertas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To his supporters in Costa Rica, is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are experiencing their fan?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is only the second time in South and Central America, and so far has been great.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have been in Costa Rica only once and holidays; it is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there.</seg>
<seg id="13">So we are excited carry our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fan living with intensity the days before.</seg>
<seg id="15">What do you say to their most ardent supporters?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you for staying with us through all these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people even refers to his concert as the largest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">It adds that a little bit of pressure on his visit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the biggest shows that we have fallen over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">A couple of shows that giant in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have made way for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">In truth, we are very eager to play there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we love surfear and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How was it discovered Costa Rica and its waves to surfear?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have a lot of friends who are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves that are unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends were always surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surfear; this was how we learn, through people who loves surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">To see the tour, have been delivering shows huge with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What they have planned for his presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As we have never touched it before, then we do not have any restrictions on what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fan a good and diverse repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat the repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why is this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think that is in part because we have nine discs and can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the repertory that we are just not to touch, that keeps us focused and we also has surprised because it reminds us why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">This makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe that it is more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of history.</seg>
<seg id="37">Looking back, it is hard to believe everything they have achieved?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I believe that none of us can imagine that we would be in a great rock band and have done so for more than 20 years that may seem like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We are counting our blessings and we are excited that we can continue to make music together.</seg>
<seg id="41">All we want and we are delighted to create music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are fortunate to go to places in the world who always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What it meant for you have been an essential part of the emergence of grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It has always been an honour to be part of this group of big bands.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something rare.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, there is a gang of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten gangs are at the same time in the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and honoured to be part of the group of Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still we touch with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in his tour, so we are fortunate to be friends of all of them yet and we are honoured to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very strange that a band like you stand united and with the same members for so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joins us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much more time for many bands.</seg>
<seg id="54">First of all, I think we are all lucky to still be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all very close friends and, as a result, have also been musical avenues open to give freedom to each of experience.</seg>
<seg id="56">We trust each other with the music of each and could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The relationship of you with the word fame has not been easy, however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How find a balance sheet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.</seg>
<seg id="60">We made sure not to be too tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of big crowds and the people who love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">While one remembers that the people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought without encapricharse for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really interested in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How recalls his another project Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I believe that we wrote very good songs and at first was a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were a band for nearly three years and never published a disk until after his death Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long, and the most important thing is that we are still a fan of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how to make me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an amazing human being and he will be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The national The Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is it true that you know his work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why the chose for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production we sent videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we are eager to see what The Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why are always changing the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings and I think that it does so with the first thing that will happen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">How downward, what are your influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">So many.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the first that spring to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many who could talk all afternoon on the falling that I adore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has managed to Pearl Jam keep relevant the grunge despite not being a fashion?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I believe that all of us we always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I mentioned earlier, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all that came at the same time, and, if there are important now, I think it is a wonderful thing because it is music worth listening and Mudhoney bands and music are now doing better than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At first, his music had a more obscure and now has become more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">Why is this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem more light, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe who qualify as songs very dark but may sound a little positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard the songs and are deeply dark.</seg>
<seg id="84">I believe that when some trauma, and there are times in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and those two songs, of course, is that for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also, I think it can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the outset to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows us to play in three dimensions without using glasses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"Mario is the person who has to say how it should operate the estereoscopía without glasses," asserted the official press Nintendo specialized in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the videogame in Madrid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first game of Nintendo originally expected for this support," because until now successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, users will be able to choose between a real-time "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The raid of Super Mario in three dimensions is also the return of the character to a portable console, which was not since 2005.</seg>
</p>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Alvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that processed the extradition of exgobernante Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for conspiracy to the laundering of $70 million.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">That is the end of the process to Guatemala to respond to the request of the country in the north that claimed to Portillo to judge there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At a press conference, Colom said that his decision is due to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that a trial court had already ordered the extradition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">He asserted that during his tenure "got their hands" in judgments and gave trámite all extraditions that has known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In addition to Portillo, will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">What has been done by Colom is a trámite executive after exhausting all constitutional and judicial authorities to prosecute the exmandatario between 2000 and 2004.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In accordance with resolutions of the Criminal Court fifth and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has settled its legal situation in Guatemala and guarantee their human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that predated the extradition, but the prosecution appealed and reactivated the case.</seg>

<seg id="1">How Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects agree on the opportunity of the appeal beyond controversy over fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Amediados of the 1980s, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed a Flyers Collserola promotion.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leaflet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">What is more, perhaps a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few who do not follow the north-south axis but above (mountain) -abajo (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The Collserola rating as a natural park is in this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalís in the role of Yogi Bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">In these was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for so many doors to Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that or someone wants to put doors to the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question is one: Collserola, park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The competition, both for its organizational merely side by posing as a reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the architects barceloneses.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost as a recurring theme to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of elected are recognized in an elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this is, in fact, one of the few similarities between what they believe three architects barceloneses, and university professors, that have been tabled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayonne: The competition is appropriate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán, having dealt with the coastline, "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain," as the speech Ildefons Cerdà, green apples, has not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There is the assumption that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things for his great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, "ruling the architect for the title of" doors of Collserola "contains a" trap léxica ": There is no question of them "as the entrance to a park, but the delimitation of areas where we need to act."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, called the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The dangers of "uncertain that is now projecting the public space" after the experience in the 1980s, and that was in the area of the Fòrum "his swan song."</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the demarcation of borders on where they can build.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Limit is set as the next step," that is, its sobrepaso.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We need to think in new instruments urban planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to accidents."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The leaner, Mòdol believes that, by simplifying the Collserola vallesana aspect of "can be seen as a park, the Barcelona, not", merely topographic.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mòdol points out that there is already a work done by the Collserola to examine "should not fall on deaf ears," although he was grateful for the opportunity that the council offers his body to intervene in this project "from the first moment."</seg>
<seg id="29">And even more, he understood that the closeness of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "no doubt" about whether it is this technical profile which must lead the multidisciplinary teams (" a success story, "says) that have had to create:" The architects should be just a tool. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayonne suggests that the answer to the question that gives way to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the competition needed a global vision of Collserola: "Have been called 16 contests in cross-cutting montaña-mar himself, he says, but there is no longitudinal reading, to see and understand the area as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="31">This is, at least in his case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.</seg>
<seg id="32">In other words, a project for one of the doors can clash in programme and definition of the architect of the next door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his view, however, the council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Round of Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that a smooth transition between the city and the green.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">The investigation was invited to participate or not, go to the sports participants of the IMSS units in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8: 00 a.m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He stressed that the protocol began in the State of Mexico (Sports Cuauhtémoc Poniente) and that since the October 8, the activity is carried out in the State of Mexico Sports Nezahualcóyolt (East).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once it complies with the aim of bringing 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the southern Independence (Sports Unit of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify Mexican risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To be held this November 14 World Diabetes Day, observed that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They are also being asked about physical activity and background heredofamiliares of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that triggered illnesses such as diabetes or kidney failure.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="15">He indicated that the justification for the search of the markers is based on the country's population differs from other genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent and five percent of Africa and this is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability to burn excess energy (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the signals it sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the Mexico Valley metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a senior researcher at the School of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who claimed that if the process of building and maintaining a pavement asfáltico is the right one, the potholes in amount could be reduced or even eliminated altogether.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his conference A bumpy technological opinion, issued in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, reported that the laboratory to develop asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater resistance, both high and low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asfaltos could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt, most of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight, so-called asfaltenos, and other low molecular weight, called maltenos, which together give the pavement viscoelástico characteristic behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Asphalt viscoelástico behavior is that at high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees Celsius presents an almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but that changes during the day, according to environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The investigator of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by pavement flexible, which consists of six layers of materials, including the last three involve the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the surface layers is the markings, consisting of small stones and then compactadas bathed in asphalt.</seg>

<seg id="15">As it is the layer that is going to be in contact with the tyres of vehicles, should take more mechanical force that the markings and provide friction along the way.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">As part of the pavement will receive and impart the efforts, rolling it must also have the right thickness and must ensure that the material is made.</seg>

<seg id="17">The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular the water, he said, because it affects the performance of the markings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the ground is humedece, water available within the folder and it is difficult to leave, this leads to a thaw in all sections of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">Also a member of the National Research System burden.30 explained that the vehicle is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement should always be in connection with the burden of vehicles, and ensure that it is complied with, to ensure that they often bumpy.</seg>

<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the tar emulsion, which in other countries are already in the market and to repair the cracks easily and without the need to use high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">What he lacked in the Valley candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Valley receives its title number 14 princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the appetite of the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the gang that the show as new princess of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and sceptre, the department has risen to 14 degrees of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women who have been vallecaucanas near the crown but were proclamations princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayalá (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Today, the big question for many is what was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite in each presentation showed that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that were queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor that is considered key to the decision by the jury to give First Princess is that were not impressed with his answer to the question, "What is this book you set for yourself, and why? By Martin Murillo Gomez, the Literary Carreta Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To the interrrogante vallecaucana replied:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think quite in literature, I think it is a form of culturalizarse, definitely I think the book that I set of childhood is" The principito ", the book is quite deep.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now I read "Crime and Punishment," is a book of world literature that we all need to read, and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called "The heat of blood".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A response that little was first by the term "culturalizarse" and second to explain exactly how each of the books cited the set.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at the end of the ceremony Melina said feel calm and happy with the result, "the universe is wise is what needs to happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The principito" is a great book "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among the scenarios dropped says that in the Valley burned favouritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist used in Bogotá suggested that to be the favourite, the ovations and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for best traditional dress, and Queen Mother), "that sparked jealousy of the other candidates, estresó queen and therefore not shone in the scene."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And that was noted in his first presentation in bathing suits on the beach of the Hilton and her two parades in the evening of coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although both lució safe, it noted that lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic itself showed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "As at home," Channel RCN felt that the fact that Melina outside designated princess "noted that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not as queen."</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle was the last very elusive with the press, and that was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that he failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is in the past, the essence of the National Competition for The Bold.</seg>
<seg id="23">For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who is committed to the social needs of their country which.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, before entering the competition are already involved in projects," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is also speculation that Valle first for their shortcomings in the derriere and fibrosis that he noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate with the 'natural' The Bold healthier body, good nutrition and physical work responsibly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The preparador of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, "but the problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, the truth for me was not very visible, he dropped points on the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the surgery was performed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The surgery are good, but he is not the Valley.</seg>
<seg id="29">His body was never his strong and here is the cost. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For this award, which for the first time the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suit was a cruel vaticinio that last night was, it was said that this was the CONTENTILLO that Raymundo awarded to Melina so as not to the taste of the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">True or not, the fact is that Melina from today begins a year reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives him the chance to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for appointment of the National Competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will go down in history as one of the queens that despite its overwhelming step in Cartagena, was elusive the crown.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">A lofoscopista Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these officials is key.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On 4 November a lofoscopista of CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the main leader of the FARC, "Alfonso Cano," through the comparison of the fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the regional branch of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" Eliazar Gonzalez, a man of Puerto Tejada is 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the start of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Cihocó, where many times had to start for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and then make the relevant courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin of friction, namely the palms of the hands and feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him wearing clothes for three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">He expected something big.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On Friday night went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="11">I knew that was supposed to identify two bodies and suspected that one of them was the man who led to the world's oldest guerrilla, so I asked him to carry the 10-finger card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when it came to the research team to the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, it was very different from what he had seen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">Was without a beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the signs do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the card.</seg>
<seg id="16">His eye was not ruled: Was "Alfonso Cano."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the main leader of the FARC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In search of the mark</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the Cali Sijín dactiloscopista recognition by the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar Gonzáles, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people do not know our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The dactiloscopia is an exact science, with no margin for error, which may be key in solving crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of those arrested.</seg>
<seg id="23">When caught, many criminals are false ballots or have no papers.</seg>
<seg id="24">We will take fingerprinting and seek in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was removing a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported its power to make a safe full of jewellery and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate areas to get a fingerprint -, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the entire and identify the offender, who had participated in various theft," he recalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in murder cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recently, they found a man dead, with bottles of liquor around them.</seg>
<seg id="29">The research found that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle was.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although this does not guarantee that was the killer, located at the scene of the crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A dactiloscopista of CTI explained that the objects' fingerprints are drawn with physical or chemical reagents. "</seg>
<seg id="32">When they occur, used a transplantador or tape to lift them.</seg>
<seg id="33">After that, the views are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the expert of the CTI.</seg>
<seg id="35">He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the television programme CSI.</seg>
<seg id="36">And not everything that is gold, not everything that it becomes footprint.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, if it can be used, if it makes the comparison.</seg>

<seg id="5">Hundreds of demonstrators agolpaban at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go through a court order that allows the "outraged" to return to camp at the site, while another part of the movement said the eviction in a park to the north of the city, where there have been further arrests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we are going to install somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the leaders of the movement, "the woman takes Wall Street," Mark Bray.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Bray decided that the response of the "outraged" the eviction of the camp personally delivered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay camped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity Church.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At least for a time managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the demonstrators, while Bray was unable to confirm the figure, while told Efe that saw several journalists who were handcuffed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The organization says that there are several hundred people who had been installed at that point, which already has shifted a delegation of religious leaders in a show of support for the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which is due to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Some of the demonstrators had posted so far at this time and passed out copies of the court order and even the officers were guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers allegedly beat demonstrators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The court order prohibits the authorities to evict members of the woman takes Wall Street or "laws that were published after the onset of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators to regain access to the park with tents or other properties that previously used."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The mayor Bloomberg said to the press that, due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the area to the public and to the demonstrators, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to be set up in tents and sleeping bags.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The regidor personally defended the eviction carried out of the night in the square Zuccotti, an operation that was about 200 arrests and decided that the demonstrators were "in violation of the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming "in a place where people came to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others," because "some business habÍan received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "failure to respect freedom of expression."</seg>

<seg id="1">Japan is reborn after the earthquake</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The GDP grew 1.5 percent thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Since last March, the Japanese economy was at a standstill, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country nipón since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="4">Initial estimates of the Tokyo government material losses estimated at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of declines, the equivalent of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP rose 1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter and a 6 percent annualized rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery is due, in part, by the increase in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, companies increased their investment in a 1.1 percent, compared with the 0.9 percent decline in capital expenditures to be observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the real trigger for the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that invited to take advantage of the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild the infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the development of the domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 percent of Japan's GDP.</seg>
<seg id="11">This variable climbed 1 percent, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The stigma of yen</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen, Japan's currency - has become one of the "values haven" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for the US, a privilege that weighs as heavy in the accounts of exporting companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large groups of technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">Toyota or Sony, for example, blaming the weak results between July and September, the value of the yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While the markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lower its guard.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most of the member countries submitted in September more visible signs of economic slowdown.</seg>

<seg id="1">The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage European</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the congress of the Union (Christian Democrat) and European Democrats (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic party.</seg>
<seg id="3">Initially had not been included in the agenda for the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that government policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="4">The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The standing Ovation for several minutes to be won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Finance Minister, removes any doubt as possible.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main thrust of the Chancellor, and the motion, summarized in a slogan: The response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Chancellor, "the time has come to lead the way in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="10">This could be in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="11">In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Indeed, it is unlikely that the 27 quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy, too.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the ball is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to ponder the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which would strengthen the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Eager to ease tensions within his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither is trying to win its conference at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of the Franco-German friendship, "Angela Merkel has not mentado to France.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except passing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recalling that two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats in the army of Napoleon.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The incidence of fraud in the sick leave</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the subsidies, the UMP and the government undertake an offensive against the sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a responsible for family allowances and delivered a speech on the subject, as recurring since 2007, the fight against fraud and social ayudantía.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition, to accompany this offensive, that part of the desire to save rigorously, but still remembers an axis of the presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, to implement budget cuts: The government is planning to workers in the private sector a fourth day of absence before they can take the low.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In short, unless there is a specific company convention, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, that is to say, a minimum of 15 percent of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is a measure that would lift a wave of anger, but that would save $280 million euros, according to Les Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic: Impose officials a day of absence without pay in case of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">As we discuss these issues, the majority is put on the table the issue of fraud, this time directed towards the abuses of the casualties.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They will be significantly increased controls and, furthermore, if someone is caught committing a fraud, will have to repay the amounts," said Xavier Bertrand said on RTL on Sunday, November 13.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seemed slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of casualties.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, since 2002, is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched several offensives policies that normally have borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French do not become ill more than in the rest of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watch carefully, first of all, the national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006, was paid more than EUR 237 million in benefits to leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute research and documentation of the economy, health, subsidies for the casualties were, in 2008, 5 percent of health care spending, rising to 11.3 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, 46 per cent to maternity and accidents, while 54 percent is related to the sick leave, a figure that rises to 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, the 2.5 percent of spending on health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average that, without doubt, hides diversions: Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75 percent of the 40,000 employees French respondents said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, in this case the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37 percent of the sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22 percent of between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent of between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent of between one and three months and 11 percent were longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="23">A study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons and otherwise) ranged in France, between 10 percent and 11 percent, compared to a 20 percent and 28 percent in Denmark, a 15 percent in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id="25">The fraud has a very limited.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to the controls of the sick leave more than 45 days to be systematic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the NCWA found in 13% of the 285,000 made, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long," i.e. 37.050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subject to regular inspections, found that 11 percent of the cases were "properly tailored or unjustified, a figure that, starting as a total of 1.2 million, $132,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Therefore, there is a total of $169,000 cases "unjustified" among several million workers to pick up a sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="30">Without doubt, negligible compared with, for example, the black economy.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, the practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9 and 15 million euros a year, or more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, of course, considerably more than the fraud in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1">A committee of experts says that should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Canadians are denying the death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian company is denying the death.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, only 9 percent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take measures to that effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts in various fields, including the ethical, legal and medical doctor.</seg>
<seg id="7">The committee recommended the government to amend the criminal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">For a start, the experts cited a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada is the 10th position, the study notes that "medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With medication or not, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians want to die at home, just 68,6% of them dying in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, the highest rate recorded in this regard the Quebec, where 86 percent of the deaths occur in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that are not in line with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it wants to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, according to experts who have studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its implementation, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not responsible or who had not given their consent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries that have not been legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal."</seg>
<seg id="17">"In Canada is assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadians, euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let us remember that 85 percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, because we believe that would allow people whose death is next to ease their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, 66 percent believed that legalizing euthanasia will not to understand that the lives of the elderly and disabled has less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for the people who have been assisted suicide, 41 percent of respondents believed that it should not start proceedings against them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, among its recommendations suggest that indicated in the penal code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The committee of experts also calls to train health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient will reject the attendance at the end of their lives without fear of facing a complaint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, in connection with palliative sedation or terminal, which is already used extensively in health institutions in Canada, the committee asked that, except that will serve to reduce the physical pain, is seen as euthanasia and be subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other experts expressed reservations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report by experts from the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it restricts the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted yesterday, a summary of the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any value to society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">However, he added that "in society, there are labels and limitations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which he called "manifesto for euthanasia."</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questioned the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="2">The introduction of a "golden rule" in the Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The grand coalition government of Social Democrat / Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" to reduce the budget deficit and avoid a possible deterioration of the note by Austria's sovereign credit rating agencies (triple A).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It was the same Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt stands at 74.6 percent, a figure much higher than the ceiling of 60 percent set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"If you reduce the solvency of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay $3 billion more in interest each year," said the Vice-Chancellor said Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Austria responds to a request from the Brussels summit to member countries of the euro zone last October 26: In it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and restoring the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The measure adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model," as Germany was the first European country that adopted such "rule."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">By 2017, the structural deficit should fall each year in a 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the federal government's structural budget deficit should not exceed each year 0.35 percent of GDP, while the regional states, as well as communities, should present balanced budgets.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Energy policy:</seg>
<seg id="2">The facts are worth more than the dogmas</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If there is an issue that cannot be treated with short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, is energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is appropriate that an election meeting is the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will be useful only if it is all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposals.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must base its opinion on facts, rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic changes will mean a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 unless depriving a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, we will have to deal with the growing shortage of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">For this reason, Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is not the case and Belgium, which makes it to the need to find a source that can replace it, and Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, determined to go ahead with their projects.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to the park, picking up the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes as an example, the reality is against such a speech.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will lead to a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions by the construction of coal and gas stations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a few months, will be felt the harmful effects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We must think about the case of Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="19">European champion in the wind industry, which gets 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the wind intermittency; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours paid an electricity bill by 40 per cent higher than the French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the utility industry in the country, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear power would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would remove realism to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a price that the vast majority of the French are refusing to pay and, in fact, they are not opposed in principle to this type of energy, polls show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let us remember that energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Widely export-oriented, covers a galaxy of small and medium-sized enterprises specializing in international markets and that can create jobs not deslocalizables.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, would be the sacrifice of a lot of these SMEs and the loss of $6 million per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">What would an electrician EPR designed to operate 60 years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer?</seg>
<seg id="28">To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity production, as there is a diabolical source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The development by Areva solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary nature of energy sources.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a security authority exercises strict control and transparent on both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.</seg>
<seg id="33">In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three major accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one, the Three Mile Island, was in normal operating conditions; no consequences for the people or the environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and human error unforgivable.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by a natural disaster of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR is a design that can resist such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While the study all the players who want to build a power plant, the termination of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to competitors of Areva and EDF, because that would leave them free rein to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear industry.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvering dominasen such an important debate to the economic, social and financial of our country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised starting from various points of view: The saturation of law enforcement, judicial and administrative policy under the figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed "country of human rights" of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, is the administrative harassment of foreign students has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclaiming of past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers and waiters."</seg>
<seg id="4">However, rarely looked at from an economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The point is that, on this issue, there is a consensus between the left and the right.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the direction in 1976, declaring that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million migrant workers," while on the left, the tone was set Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the level of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of the invasion of the country by a crowd of plumbers.</seg>
<seg id="9">On both sides, it believes that immigrants are a burden on the economy and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the level of generosity with acting with regard to immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that the co-development will solve the problem of migration. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is profitable electorally, but economically is very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Economists such as Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that sums up the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 665-672.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Limiting immigration harms the weakening growth and employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the low-skilled, pushing to reduce their salaries.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for domestic workers are mainly in professions and sectors with a lack of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="17">Low-skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract skilled workers in national and most dynamic sectors where the training does not meet the demand for staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that has no surgeon, complementarity between nationals and immigrants means that the arrival of the latter have a positive impact on wages and employment of nationals.</seg>
<seg id="20">In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows is a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and to economic growth, there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Immigrants also are net contributors to the social systems, because they provide an average of 1 percent of the total budget in European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average during his lifetime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to find points of growth that it was "with teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">These teeth, to stop immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers as "is a certainty."</seg>
<seg id="5">"The way in which the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey for people involved in Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day, along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the rubble of the intervention, the Nigerian and French researchers discovered several telephone chips that belonged to terrorists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of terrorist axis</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study of the calls made out to several players based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially attracted the interest of researchers: One leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other a man who reportedly is close to Aqmi and the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This is a step forward, but we certainly should expect to have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But it is possible."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign intellectual and financial support and that is becoming more active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In recent months, these "support" had been increasingly evident in the development and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operational methods, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and in the same way that the used by Aqmi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, starting with Washington, has since then pushing Muscat to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long been considered the group as a community of enlightened unworthy of interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A quick success</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam, Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin "), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this poor region, the association is experiencing a quick success.</seg>
<seg id="22">Be politicized and requires a strict respect of Sharia law, while its militants launched the fight against the central government godless.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are first to churches, bars, the administrations.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, the Boko Haram militants were particularly active and increased attacks against police stations.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reaction of Muscat was, as so often happens, widespread.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army attacked the city and there were 800 people dead.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since then, the sect is even sharper and abandoned their strongholds in the north.</seg>
<seg id="29">Last Christmas, claims an attack that causes 80 killed in Jos and, later, another in Muscat.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, Boko Haram returns to attack against Muscat, in particular the protection of the police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations in his first international goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of an axis of terrorism in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria, anxious to all security specialists.</seg>
<seg id="33">While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis Al-Chebab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the heart of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic?</seg>
<seg id="4">Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that it is.</seg>
<seg id="5">A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been increasingly estruendosas statements and shortcuts in terms of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Spread the slogans, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, aid to Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, the candidate best positioned in the race for the nomination for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to lead to the Chinese in the WTO and, where "by manipulating its currency," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of fragments of the entire sector to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drown before an attitude that "apabulla 'emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Has called for a dialogue, but constructive, with Beijing (the current position of Obama).</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman, which is stalled in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Reagan style</seg>
</p>

<seg id="14">"If I am elected, will stop Iran," fanfarroneó.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If Obama gets re-elected, will have the bomb."</seg>
<seg id="16">He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed to meet its obligations in connection with this partner.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">The businessman Herman Cain, the candidate with the second best classified, shows a shameful lack of such issues.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Governor Rick Perry tejano, which supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, said that, for its part, is ready to deploy the US military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="20">The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also recommend Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are considerable differences with the Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Opponents of the current President answered that Reagan was also simple ideas and who won the Cold War.</seg>
<seg id="23">Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the pistón in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit of the "boys" of Iraq and its distortions in Libya, and labeled as weak.</seg>

<seg id="25">But the attacks are not simple.</seg>
<seg id="26">The judge in a more positive assessment of Obama's national security, which ended with bin Laden.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Nord Stream, new gateway of Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly to Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.</seg>
<seg id="3">To supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have been together the wheel of the valve that controls the flow of Russian gas in the network of Western Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new pipeline, each year will 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through a first had to 1,224 km told the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklemburgo-Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, enough to cover the entire French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the completion in time for this huge project has winds of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Poland and the Baltic countries were firmly opposed to the project.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the Nord Stream will supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">In one fell swoop, these two countries lose some of its power: For them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatened to block his access to the markets of Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new Nazi-Soviet pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, to support the Russian draft, has gained greater security of supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a gap between the Eastern and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has, in just five years, to succeed his vision of an alliance between Russia and Western countries rich, major consumers of gas reserves and increasingly limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organically," confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, showing the extent to which the big gas contracts are so political and economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.</seg>
<seg id="22">The submarine is made of steel pipe recubierto of cement to protect it against the anchors of ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">Based on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 metres deep.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precautionary measure," says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also, it was necessary to step up measures to protect the flora and fauna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted along its entire length, or valves, or maintenance stations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scheduled a platform of control in the waters of Sweden, but officials declined to project the same to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company was permanently in the sea off its coast.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the event of failure, suspending the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the event of a leak, the gas pipeline will be released to the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the builders are unlikely to see a flight because they have planned junturas, according to forecasts, will have a flight every 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a robot submarine, dragged down by a ship, which is carrying out inspections, as well as by a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the form of a pure, introduces inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, provides accurate data on possible distortions of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any kind of repair.</seg>
<seg id="36">The movement of the gas is simply because of the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">The principle is 200 bars and, at the end of 100 bars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have joined forces to be able to carry out this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The company leader is Gazprom, which owns 51 percent of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">To her, joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5 percent each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9 percent each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">Has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="43">Later, Gazprom rented in this society, for a period of 25 years, renewable, all of the gas transmission capabilities.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is really transport," says Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30 percent with the input of shareholders and a 70 percent through bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the project should reach 7.4 million euros for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached $240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But minority shareholders are confident that it will exceed its investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline is emerging in the Baltic in Lubmin, planted in a sandy coast.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some valves, with 4.5 metres high, form the exit door of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas to the arrival, before being transferred to the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Founded half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for writing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with their black rectangular pasta, rubber, its white sheets, as old at the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the current with the Moleskine notebooks were born... in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time the market a notebook of design, but distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, saw the launch of the new product.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book is based on an ancient technique of production, the huge amount of mole skin (skin), which refers to a cotton barnizado used, among other things, to cover the stools.</seg>
<seg id="9">This type of book was highly valued by the writers and travellers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The current moleskine has adapted to an old and forgotten, an icon of the pioneering artists until the 20th century," Maria Sebregondi, since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">And the success.</seg>
<seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.</seg>
<seg id="13">Confidential production has been far from the early years, in which were only 3,000 books.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moleskine goes beyond the borders of Italy and export their products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the report card attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.</seg>
<seg id="16">Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cults.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its inception, now has nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.</seg>
<seg id="18">Distributed their notebooks in bookshops, since the Fnac to small shops in the centre of the city, and has been able to impose their identity.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.</seg>
<seg id="20">This signature cultural goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists presented their own notebook.</seg>
<seg id="21">In August, also launched a notebook with covers of leopard, the Locarno Film Festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Taking advantage of its success and this aura cultural, Moleskine has managed to diversify their products: Handbags, notebooks, pens, veneers of computer... The brand covers a wide range of media.</seg>
<seg id="23">A success that causes envy: In the autumn of 2006, Mode Mode was bought by the investment fund, GS Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, escribiéndose a new page in the history of Moleskine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the unemployment rate of the disabled workers remains so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 19 percent of disabled people are looking for a job.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 15th week for the employment of the disabled begins today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is twice the average rate of 19 per cent, compared with 9 percent for the whole of the population.</seg>
<seg id="5">How grim?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No," says Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The progress made over the last 15 years are considerable.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher than the average.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, there is still much to be done."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It is worth mentioning that the unemployed disabled still face many obstacles to access to employment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tend to have an older age: 37 per cent has more than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a low level of qualification: 80 percent had not finished high school, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, long-term unemployment is rife among them: 53 percent for the disabled, compared to 38 percent on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is to say, there are many issues that hinder the return to work and that is the crux of the problem, "says Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These are the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people moving, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A survey conducted in April by the association for the Cite IMS-Entreprendre managers surveyed said they have "a level of knowledge about disability under," with "a large proportion of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result: Private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of recruiting a 6 percent of disabled workers, a goal set by law... 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the latest figures available, dating back to 2008, at a ratio of 2.6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Now we reached around 3 percent," says Pierre Blanc, general manager of Agefiph, the agency in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not respect the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The test: The number of establishment "under this provision," as well as the amounts disbursed, have declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated a great deal of pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this also reflects a real awareness, especially among the large groups."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 percent of companies with between 20 and 49 workers with disabled employees in its workforce, compared to 82 percent of companies with 100 to 199 workers.</seg>
