<p>
<seg id="2">Ukraine&#39;s parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the amendment to the Penal Code section condemning the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.</seg>

<seg id="1">The victory of Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The history of the liberation of Libya, or Libyan rebellion, and has its losers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret location in the desert and without it there is no war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It remains to define who is the winner</seg>
<seg id="5">As has become customary in the region, Islamists won elections, but now it is necessary to ascertain whether it is moderate or radical</seg>
<seg id="6">The National Transitional Council has made entry into force of customary law, sharia, already somewhat familiar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Libya will become a country without crime because the robbers were cut by hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women can go and forget about emancipation and the rebels awaiting execution and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Instead of the dictator by the person, society, composed of warring tribes, will join in the Qur&#39;an.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Libya, establish an order that we can not even imagine and certainly can not.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit them, however, the Libyans already mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="12">The truth is that not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accept help from infidel dogs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO airstrikes directed not an American general, larger but Allah, whose greatness held after each successful interventions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">When searching for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are caught in a shootout served the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.</seg>
<seg id="16">After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, not occupy Libya militarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this case, the premises do not pose a problem to drive the &quot;crusaders&quot;</seg>
<seg id="18">But, without occupation, how the oil will get done with the black gold Libyan only with good words?</seg>
<seg id="19">Quite possibly not, but it might finally West can boast of protecting human rights.</seg>
<seg id="20">Provided that the followers of the sharia not cross us.</seg>

<seg id="1">Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">More than a third of children aged between 9 and 13 are overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity to 5%.</seg>
<seg id="3">Obese children mostly come from families with a lifestyle that is unhealthy, as is clear from current research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It again shows how important is the environment where it is grown for healthy development of the individual as well as serve as reference models.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In the table, obese children are fed, for example, sausages at least twice as likely than children from families with normal weight.</seg>
<seg id="6">For dinner, over 19% of the obese had dined on chips before analysis, which is linked to the prevention program &quot;Obesity is not a chance.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In families of overweight children no custom of sports, which applies to most families today, where only 15% of children said their parents, at least once a week, find time for exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Survey of 900 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The survey was conducted late last school year and participated in it nearly 900 children of basic education throughout the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was the second edition of the program &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.</seg>
<seg id="11">So far, participated in the project over 12 thousand children from the 4 th to 8 th grade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Proper diet and plenty of exercise as a family are determinants, which decrease significantly the number of overweight and even obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">&quot;Only half the children surveyed responded that they have five meals a day according to the scheme: breakfast, lunch, dinner, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,&quot; reflects one of the survey results .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">No breakfast but for dinner sausage</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Experts warn that, in healthy development, are important as well, the details, they also have, such as having a set time for breakfast with the family.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of families had breakfast at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In most families, each breakfast alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">But worse was to discover that 10% of households do not have breakfast at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">Breakfast is, however, the base of a proper diet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The study shows that in families of obese children consume much more often unhealthy chips.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink sweet drinks daily (70%).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Generally make sport more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this result reduces to less than half, only 15%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Fabricate your diet</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next phase of the study allowed the kids elect (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) will create their own diets from all possible deals according to your tastes and opinions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">&quot;Food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="26">Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets</seg>
<seg id="27">&quot;It is especially alarming popularity of sweet drinks,&quot; he warns in the final study report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">As a main meal takes the biscuit dough and follows closely the poultry.</seg>
<seg id="29">Practically, children always reject the legume and a taste for fish and vegetables is very low.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Healthy habits change</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">&quot;In the control group of study participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the prevention program&quot; Obesity is not a chance, &quot;was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of healthy eating &quot;noted in the results of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It is striking, for example, on sweet soft drinks, where many children begin to prefer the ordinary water.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the introductory article, How to learn the stylists, I complained that some initial lessons were already highly charged.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had no idea how that would go.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conferences of three professionals in the industry, how to dress problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in show business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer the final exams, more information and practical tasks lie ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, and not be a pin.</seg>
<seg id="8">Once we have studied with the principal, Alena, (in the course no man) on how to dress women who do not have perfect symmetry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And that&#39;s the majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized figure without appropriate curves and someone is overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The stylist must know optically smooth broad shoulders, neck lengthening or recreate the charts needed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We have given some tips on how to highlight women&#39;s body type of Jennifer Lopez, huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and yet dress in a manner not too challenging</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is such that the skirt or pants do not fit, sewing is worth doing at least one piece of extra fabric to size.</seg>
<seg id="14">Surely you will not regret, because the clothes feel well is priceless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">With a skirt as you will feel much better than one that does not stop moving, get up, dance around the waist, etc..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The slim body be allowed to wear clothing with folds, ornaments, embroidered or drapes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I&#39;m glad that I have all week to put order in my head all this information.</seg>
<seg id="18">And even so, I fear that with the assignment, I have more than enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each course participant has been assigned two famous, who should design two costumes: one for daytime and one for the night.</seg>
<seg id="20">Keep in mind the current look, the fashion style that suits the person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I have had to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, perhaps the campaign may know Victoria&#39;s Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Cry on the inside, for me is much better than, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently put on a few hundred kilos will (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The dresses have to cut them from magazines or search online and print, and then develop them graphically.</seg>
<seg id="24">The mood board, which is the name of the complete result is further our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is important to also consider the graphical styling.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stylist, therefore, did not see only physically but also addresses, for example, the product pages in magazines (of specific topics such as trends, handbags, coats, etc..).</seg>
<seg id="27">From all this we talked the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik.</seg>
<seg id="28">But this is already for Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The stylist must have a global vision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The three invited speakers encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on all body types.</seg>
<seg id="31">Honza Pokorný stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should take advantage of this saberle.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variability is, in this case essential.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Thus, this raincoat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can dress up the classic jeans and shirt, but also serves to clothe the naked body with high heels and photograph as if it were actually a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just arremangarla and up the neck to get a totally different picture.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;Play with it,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">What I value most is the following advice: &quot;To start working, you first need may know all the rules.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="39">&quot;Then now you can break them,&quot; said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I finally clear why memorize all these formulas, what goes with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.</seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention the shows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reservation of the intended photograph.</seg>
<seg id="43">Thus, for a fashion story with ten pages (so, ten outfits), it must be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And the photos clothing works in combination with other pieces, all different from those used in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">This must be taken into account when designing the outfit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Honza Pokorný assured us that the look and feel represent themselves, in many cases, half of success.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and márquetin have made her a worldwide star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even celebrities are also useless (my skills are enough for me, my physical appearance is not as important).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And when someone asks us our services, we must bear in mind that we are likely to indicate a size very different from their own real (lower).</seg>
<seg id="51">Then only is GOOGLE and find out if the gossip magazines have written about it, if a certain celebrity has gained / lost weight, etc..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">On Sunday, Mario Honza and we insisted that the stylist is not enough fashion oriented, but must understand outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">During his work, especially must communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">Value people know, is not less, defend their opinions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">&quot;When you hire a director for her clothing and clasifiquéis completéis it with pretty clothes, you can not catch and throw everything he had and say,&quot; Wow what a horror. &#39;&quot;</seg>
<seg id="56">&quot;Find at least a couple of things that you can ponder and recommend to someone can put them,&quot; says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He also showed us that everything must fit into the &quot;placovka&quot;, ie the labor exchange.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is set around the waist and have all the tools there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Are objects such as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas or miss. There are also nylon thread (which serves as the stylist for the photo shoot of such products as handbags and hats), special clips ahead clothes hook, whichever is greater (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, they may damage the fabric), or a sewing kit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">To not stay in the passive listening and putting something into practice, we have learned to take the soles of shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even during the photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, could damage the soles and even more abroad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And we did more than take and take.</seg>
<seg id="63">We could not touch the shoes with scissors to avoid damaging them by accident.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had to be very skilled.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation.</seg>
<seg id="66">The truth is that not very well give me those skills.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a small part of everything we&#39;ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.</seg>
<seg id="68">Now I realize that devote to professional level styling is not a path of roses, but I&#39;m just like what people say.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">A journey, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper neglect a routine trip for the morning shift.</seg>
<seg id="4">To some extent succeeded in meeting the expectations, but this is useless, if not actually intended to do anything extraordinary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new release, the title to which is added The Run, and raised high expectations before its release.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised to give new life to old racing franchise Need for Speed ​​and, following what is shown, appears as a game that should not end up being again a no further action genre.</seg>
<seg id="7">We are also curious about how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character gets out the car and walks on his own feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are careers that can be given for acceptable, but in calculating total points are lost because of absurd faults, which are already appearing on the show for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact can neither be called errors, but is rather incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">It introduces you into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems to solve, is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">You sit at the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive early to New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea is to offer something interesting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into ten steps and then over fifty races.</seg>
<seg id="16">It follows that each race is a different route and stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, one does not have anywhere near the feeling that the game offers the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous installments of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore, there is no big deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the walk through the desert, autumn landscape or high snow capped mountains produce a very nice visual effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In addition, the races are diversified occasionally by an atypical element.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, for example, in the desert you encounter a sandstorm visibility decreases.</seg>
<seg id="23">In contrast, in the mountains must be careful lest you bury an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">According to this, each of the races is very well developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are only a few models, but that&#39;s enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a moment you try to overtake a number of competitors required (normal in a classic race), then you try to buy time (timed classic duel) and then awaits a match against a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">Amid all this appears sometimes the police, which only further complicate things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The novelty is the landscape outside the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">We present interactive animations when Jack, in most cases, someone has to escape and you have to help, always pressing the button just at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Surprisingly, however, there is far less scenery in the game than expected (in particular there are only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the circumstances already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.</seg>
<seg id="34">That means today is no longer a big deal, but you can not say that bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you seek a realistic simulation, and can look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But a race conceived quite enough action suits this style of driving, but we can find something better between games of competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, so good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But problems arise after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the right of driving models, no longer the case with collisions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In games of this type is not expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a strike against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, so that not everything is in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typically, when making a tight overtaking or move the car with normal traffic, only has slight rubbing, but almost identical in other situations, your car just pirouetting out of control.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even just totally destroyed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to reset, no major problems arise, but can put you in a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="44">The resets are scheduled so that, when you suffer an accident or you go off the track, the game restores to last savepoint on the track.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, in each race only has five resets available.</seg>
<seg id="46">If you consume all, you must restart the race from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">So is only an aid in case something does not go well, but not very reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes they do not reset help, just helps to learn the given stage of memory.</seg>
<seg id="49">A major drawback of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.</seg>
<seg id="50">In some corners, for example, must be entered in a specific way, otherwise, are impossible to take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Other times you find yourself somewhere vehicle &quot;civilian&quot; always with the same configuration, even if you&#39;re the first, fifth or arrive five minutes earlier or later.</seg>
<seg id="52">This makes raging especially in situations when you see two cars going in opposite directions to the meeting, your opponent forward smoothly, but when you arrive, you must turn or stop.</seg>
<seg id="53">It&#39;s the same when arrive, because it is programmed by the &quot;surprise&quot; always happen in front of your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents also have an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game you will come to places where, regardless of the time, I always advance the same opponent in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also this happens at the end of the game in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.</seg>
<seg id="57">Your opponent must come before you, at any cost.</seg>
<seg id="58">When he goes before you, I obscures the view of oncoming cars, so at first you can crush the car.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">One can understand the idea of ​​creating a game with high doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you right away.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action, so that often can not follow in detail what happens or where.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it really does not matter if the idea has merit fifty or classification exclusive tracks in the race for the avoidance of boredom, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Unusual idea is to change cars during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must be aware of the petrol pumps beside the road, because there just have to change cars, but in most cases what you have will suffice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars to the highways straight and exotic supercars to drive technique, for example, curvy mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Besides the main narrative thread also appears a parallel challenges, ie, there are careers in specific places that know the stories.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here gettin not only medals, but experience points to your profile, which serves both the challenges and stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">Upon reaching the top level, the driver will open several possibilities, starting with the car and ending funding for the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the same time, there are connected online Autolog function that compares your results with other players and make available other community functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the most difficult to understand is how is made the final race in history.</seg>
<seg id="71">With the car you come to the Tube (go), where you set about running in the dark by the way (pass).</seg>
<seg id="72">The speedometer will make between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and suddenly, behind you the convoy reaches the subway and takes you no further ahead.</seg>
<seg id="73">In writing we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, whether during programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical part of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases enjoyable, sometimes even arrogant.</seg>
<seg id="75">Well, what a pity that in the tensest moments reduces the image quality and, sometimes, in a grave.</seg>
<seg id="76">This applies especially where there are accidents involving many participants, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In order to be pleasing to most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category &quot;each of his father and mother,&quot; but one can assume that nobody would buy the game only for his music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The final sense of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.</seg>
<seg id="80">Avoided if the game absolutely dumb mistakes, we would have problems in saying that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">It seems that the game is not over.</seg>
<seg id="82">Fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because you hit the errors in eyes with the force of some reflectors airport.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs have a reputation of naysayers and Eurosceptic.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">&quot;The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions&#39;</seg>
<seg id="4">&quot;I did not expect reassembly-out war.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="5">&quot;It will last five, six years before the situation stabilizes a bit, calm down and new players get used to their new roles,&quot; with conviction and began his lecture at the Law Faculty of the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How not to take seriously the motto &quot;Europe clearly and openly,&quot; he said as early as the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe every organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, it would be the envy of many speakers Faculty of Law, U. Carolina.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent European Council president, Herman van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">&quot;First come the criticism, if it is bland, a gray, capable of assuming any role, but I must say that left everyone confused, because it assumes their roles to perfection.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="9">&quot;He is a man who listens to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new post of representative of the foreign and security policy is explained from the question &quot;Who is this EU? What number I can call?&quot;. It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of union policy towards states like China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Nobody wants to forbid the cheese from Olomouc</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Vicenová has also worked on the agenda was, is and will continue the European Council in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the government at that time was identified as a negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the ambassador: &quot;a good riot&quot; not only the presidency but also the financial crisis being treated now.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the other hand, we must adopt the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the budget is more simple and effective, which sectors have priority, which countries will receive more support and the least? That is something that will be on the agenda for the next meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The ambassador also recalled their main slogans with which came to Europe: &quot;Europe About clearly.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="21">&quot;The truth is that I do not like ugly abbreviations, foreign words or jargon that people do not understand.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="22">&quot;How can a citizen realize that Brussels is not really invent the curvy cucumber cucumbers or round, bananas of different sizes or that no one is going to ban cheese from Olomouc?&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="23">It also aims to get more out of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Europe awaits speeds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people see the negative rather than positive.</seg>
<seg id="26">He regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Blame it on many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also little support for the Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, emphasized the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;Believe me when I go to a Pole and a Hungarian and a Slovak me about a Frenchman next to me says:&quot; What ye been, the Visegrad Group? &quot;And you see that does not make no grace. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the future, the EU, according Vicenová, await new regulations harsh budgetary policy for the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is perceived as very real concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new &quot;European Federation&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">&quot;We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the eurozone.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="33">&quot;We have the Schengen area and also the enhanced cooperation procedure.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="34">&quot;They first said that only countries that want to cooperate and not to be left out.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="35">&quot;These procedures will become more and strengthen the two-speed Europe&quot; is expected Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this sense, also highlighted the role of Czech and Herman van Rompuy on the principle according to which all matters affecting the whole EU should be discussed between member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Brand story:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovative IBM begins its second century</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If someone searched for a term that would define very precisely the strategy of IBM, the closest would be &quot;long term&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived to be present and yet one hundred years have passed since its foundation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this character largoplacista put the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Mr. Watson</seg>
<seg id="6">And he coined the slogan that many world problems can be solved if people are willing to think.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Their motto &quot;Think!&quot; became his trademark, round which will be built the future life of the giant (he was also the title of an internal IBM magazine began publishing in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">Watson was also the basis of a corporate culture carefully lifted.</seg>
<seg id="9">&quot;For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement toward the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because he remained true to his principles, but fear the changes around them.</seg>
<seg id="11">This has allowed us, during our first century, transforming technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope to prosper further in our second century, &quot;for their anniversary, the current company director Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A sophisticated system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, now in the 30&#39;s, worried about the care of its employees as the employer of Bata in the Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were among the first U.S. workers enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, uniforms, elegant and sophisticated payment system rewarded the best inventors and sellers.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same long-term sophistication IBM maintains the customer relationship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the beginning the company was able to discover talent (being one of the world leaders in ending all forms of discrimination, could choose without problems).</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM&#39;s current plan, which will replace Palmisano to next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">She already has worked thirty years at IBM, where he was head of sales, márquetin and strategies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, brainstorming online, from which arise numerous future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not surprisingly, leftover ideas, because the signature work almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A reputable institution</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than a technology company,&quot; says economist professor at the Harvard Business School and author of book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">&quot;IBM is a technology company but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,&quot; notes George Colony of Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company says there is a difference between going into business and create a business directly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or the &quot;Big Green&quot; - as it is known in the U.S. familiar because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is possibly the most versatile technology company (both equipment and develops programs, infrastructure and hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).</seg>
<seg id="28">Has the highest number of patents of all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, swaps, bar codes and floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM will charge this year of $ 220 billion. This year has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when first passed in 1996 to Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking to the future</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations just cater to the tastes of customers and the time (IBM opted for its own operating system, OS / 2, Prodigy online services or computers IBM PCjr).</seg>
<seg id="33">&quot;If your business is based on progress, not emotionally be anchored in the past,&quot; admitted Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">So IBM has no trouble building its bases in other platforms (and equally, if not work, the leaves).</seg>
<seg id="35">And that&#39;s apart from the competition, Microsoft, which basically is maintained and always falls exclusively on Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Future technology</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Within sales, IBM is dedicated primarily to services, with approximately one fifth are one-fifth of programs and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yet even in 1990 the teams representing more than half the share of suppliers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM has sold underperforming assets totaling 15 billion dollars. During the same period, has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology.</seg>
<seg id="40">Investments have continued since 2008, when he first manifested the modern global financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM acts on the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great depression increased from 29 investments.</seg>
<seg id="42">It seems that so far the company has managed IBM weather the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the shares of IBM from the beginning of 2008 has risen stratospherically up to 120%, net profit of the company has continued to increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">IBM&#39;s motto is to change everything except their value.</seg>
<seg id="45">You can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this giant flexible endure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">History of IBM: from cheese slicer to spaceflight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The IBM is a long established name in 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The foundation that gave birth to IBM is a merger of four companies dating back to 1880.</seg>
<seg id="50">Owned inventions such as the famous &quot;time clock&quot;, which controls the entry and exit of employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Flint Ranlett, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint joined the head of a competitor, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with managing the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson&#39;s ideas remain the firm base on which to support the corporate culture and identity).</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson ran the business until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name suggests, started producing and selling all kinds of equipment for businesses, from cheese and meat cutters to cash registers.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years that Watson ran the company, sales doubled in $ 9 million and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so crucial to the company, almost forty years after occupying the chair of the chief, was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 60 staff and IBM computers helped guide NASA space flights (Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the moon).</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.</seg>
<seg id="61">The classic &quot;fish&quot;, which implemented the standard computers of that time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to China&#39;s Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began offering comprehensive advice and services of high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy has paid the last three years IBM&#39;s Smarter Planet concept, ie a &quot;smarter planet&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="64">Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, but not yet planned areas or circumstances have improved, for example, with regard to transport and city administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">For commerce, IBM introduced the platform not long ago &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a long history in this country.</seg>
<seg id="67">And in 1932 opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country that had in the Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here today, IBM ČR also operates strategic outsourcing center in Brno</seg>
<seg id="69">The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here is a team of world-renowned research working with speech recognition.</seg>

<seg id="4">Shopping</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Does your significant other complains that you have reliance on purchases?</seg>
<seg id="6">Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?</seg>
<seg id="7">Would you like to shop often in the sales?</seg>
<seg id="8">So if you can say that shopping has become a vice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Some women find that they should appease your passion for shopping, at least a little.</seg>
<seg id="10">But see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more clothing stores, clothes look tight and then try them all in the fitting room (ideally in all different colors)?</seg>

<seg id="21">Sex is also strongly agree that the more increases the frequency of complaints, most women become annoying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The housekeeping first</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It&#39;s like a carousel infinity.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cleaning windows, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, scrubbing the tub and everything at least twice a week.</seg>
<seg id="25">Does your partner complains that he has walked the floor clean with dirty feet, their children who have just cleaned dirty sink and a shelf with glass doors that you worked so hard to clean?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">If you suffer this &quot;deviation&quot;, try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that the housekeeping probably should not take be paramount in the family.</seg>
<seg id="27">This desire harmless cleaning could threaten their relationships and family welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Make nasty comments</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">&quot;The shorts worn are left with the laundry.&quot;</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">Naturally. You do not mean anything bad, just want to make sure everything is in order.</seg>
<seg id="34">Maybe if men knew this, women, meanwhile, would not make so many comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Slander and gossip</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Some women are also libel, slander, but also the offenses and the conspiracy against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="37">Women are concentrated in relationships, why they like to talk together about things such as who, where, with whom, how and why.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Maybe each one of us sometimes lets out a small, harmless gossip.</seg>
<seg id="39">Hand on heart, this is typical of most women.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the other hand, women gossiping of these are not controlled, they love to gossip and often do, look down on everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially on a female labor.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How prices have changed since 1989 trips</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 there was in the then Czechoslovakia only five state authorized travel agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Autoturist Rekrea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies of that time sold in most cases only the socialist travel, for travel to the West were very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists were, therefore, on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary ( Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime bowed to the west and travel for Czech tourists were then quite restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (ie, also the Czechs) are not allowed to travel freely and individually even by socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agencies also offered at that time travel to the West, but you must queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have &quot;known good&quot; in the agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet all was not won.</seg>
<seg id="10">The &quot;promise of change&quot; that was the condition for trips to the West, not attached to the &quot;politically unreliable people,&quot; so could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible currency without warranty of change was not possible to obtain the resources (money west) to travel to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so that a large number of cottages and summer homes, the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The mode of travel for the Czechs since 1989 has undergone a revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While until 1989 for us was the ultimate holiday in the GDR and Bulgaria, the Czech last year made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It nna great paradox, which today we are not aware that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 no one could travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia then.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the early 90&#39;s was imposed visa free travel to the neighboring states of Western Europe, causing a huge surge of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czechs, for a long time, were not tired of the trips to the West, everyone wanted to see him at least for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris slept Czech groups in parks in tents, as our income then we were not allowed to pay a hotel or pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of the Czechs at the time was the take with the food (canned food, sausages, etc.). To save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another highlight was the introduction of the convertibility of the koruna, so our visitors could finally, after decades, western currency bought freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and with it increased average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in travel demand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With increasing demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 regularly, prepare trips using charter flight connections, making it incredibly lower prices on travel compared to the past, thanks to the possibility to obtain volume discounts for passengers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the late 90s of last century, and the Czechs traveling without visas to almost all developed countries except the U.S., which further simplified our trips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of tourism and post-revolutionary happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since that year, every year start direct charter flights with Czech tourists was hot and distant countries. This winter already fly direct from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">The visit exotic countries currently about 100 000 Czechs year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting moment of this time, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On November 17, 2008, USA abolished visas for Czech tourists, so that our country came to be among the world&#39;s most developed countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time ever, have spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, has been spent on foreign travel more than 15 000 SEK Czechs head, including spending on the ranch site.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Ordinary General Meeting convened to elect the president, who could end up back in neutral.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For nearly five months the Czech football is without a president and likely successor to Ivan Hasek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FACR), will not be known or after the notice of Extraordinary General Meeting next to be held on Thursday Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, not yet reached agreement on the voting rules to follow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without them, you can not even vote to choose between three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those interested in chairing the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hašek resigned in June but not before his colleagues call for the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, after concluding Hasek era, there arose a dispute between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This became evident on September 16 when he had to be elected the new president.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates to the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smichov, because the talks were blocked and not only in the method of choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus as to who or the General Assembly had the right to vote - but also the legal representatives or delegates with full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">From that time and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law under which the representation is not possible to full power.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">More light on the situation and could not drive or the Executive Committee at its meetings, regular or special, basically solved nothing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the key point remains the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how will proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">&quot;The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model,&quot; says Dusan Svoboda, one of three vice presidents of the FACR, who, from the direction of the association represents the professional soccer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win one candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Moravian is willing to compromise so you can win one candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.</seg>
<seg id="19">The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two-thirds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">&quot;This would take, however, the sense of the previous two rounds and negate the whole concept of bicameral system,&quot; is as Svoboda understand the objections of the Moravian, whereby it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to applicable statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With that said, surprisingly, agrees Thomas also Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates is best for Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">&quot;I would like a vote as possible in accordance with the statutes.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;To not make up any nonsense about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,&quot; says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and directing his remarks mainly against Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him, Nymburk be decided on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future cooperate constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;All passions appease today&#39;s match with our national team at the European Championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">&quot;Football will be the protagonist, and thus cooperate more comfortable,&quot; said the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is the most reticent.</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;I hope they reach an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="30">&quot;This is not the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="31">&quot;This can result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="32">&quot;Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail,&quot; said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">There is not much time for all the parties reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until you start the game if the soccer team will be complete?</seg>
<seg id="35">The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, including vice president Dalibor Rajchl Kucera and has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to carry on the executive committee to take place where the qualifier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be taking place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Josef Dobes A Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would love to incorporate the divided parts of the organization&#39;s most powerful sports country to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">The stakes are high: state subsidies, the credibility of football and the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak federation of sport (CSTV) will try to give a new direction to the sport Czech financial problems after the house lottery Sazka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík fight for the presidency, because they can not find a suitable candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the head of the players of Pilsen, Tomas Paclik before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all their ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FACR), or be a candidate to so important a position.</seg>
<seg id="41">&quot;If there was a suitable person would be fighting for it and I stand as candidate in the elections.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="42">&quot;But until today not been able to find a person,&quot; said Paclík to the Czech News Agency (CTK)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the ability to block Pelta, the presumed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FACR).</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also points out that, if overcome, would remain in office as president only until 2013, when it would turn to the ordinary general assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this role you would like to see an expert and good manager is not too related to football events.</seg>
<seg id="46">&quot;I&#39;ve talked to some people they might consider.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="47">&quot;For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this time not even want to identify with the Czech football.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="48">&quot;I would like to change that view,&quot; he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What bothers Paclík supposedly now is Pelta relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association Berbr Roman Pilsen, a man with a controversial past, known outside the scene as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence voting delegates at the general assembly.</seg>
<seg id="50">Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">&quot;If you win, would remain in force status in football and nothing will change.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="52">&quot;With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, soccer will draw even less profit,&quot; said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">He also mentioned that a few years ago called Pelta was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, which went unpunished Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="54">&quot;I do not know what could bring prestige football Pelta&#39;s victory.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="55">&quot;And with what eyes we look at the UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, also taken with some caution his earlier statement that &quot;if you sell the Club Pilsen Pelta become president.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the case of winning the election on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.</seg>
<seg id="57">In same view is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to be followed.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="59">&quot;It&#39;s very capable.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="60">&quot;I could imagine it, for example, as chief representative.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="61">&quot;But not as an association manager.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="62">&quot;I do not put my nose where I am able,&quot; he added Paclík, which in September raised a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Referees Committee chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík admits that one would manage the partnership.</seg>
<seg id="64">Uses its management capabilities of private companies, for since last summer is also the Director of Pilsen, whose support held in May in the first division victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">&quot;I have power to change some things on the football field and contribute to safe practice.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="66">&quot;To reduce the influence of pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, resulting in unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their dislike of the president Daniel Křetínský Sparta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">A priority would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FACR and Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which put pressure on political leaders to commit more money to sport lottery taxes.</seg>
<seg id="68">&quot;One of the key issues that should be devoted to the new president.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="69">&quot;If you increase taxes on gambling, as advertised political parties support their arguments, but, frankly, have to say where it will stop all this money,&quot; he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Also, now Paclík disregards even its association with the Club Pilsner, though he himself claims that the President of the FACR should be &quot;nonpartisan.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">&quot;It&#39;s not ideal.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="73">&quot;But I see no meaning to the fact hypocritically give my actions Pilsen Club to another person and then go back there after a year and half,&quot; said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta FACR promised the new statutes that would end the stalemate in the election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association a candidate for president, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if elected, would ensure that the new statutes FACR would definitely serve to solve in the future, disputes as to the electoral regulations.</seg>
<seg id="76">The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could progress towards a settlement today with the possible victory of the football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Even before the elections held in September, focusing Pelta promised, if elected, precisely in the representation and fundraising.</seg>
<seg id="78">Decided to participate in the last minute in the last general meeting, so this delay of two months he could do well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">&quot;People at all levels of football takes a long time ago and is looking forward to this Thursday the new President.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="80">&quot;They feel it is time for someone to manage the association,&quot; the man who thinks primarily associated with Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="81">For this reason, thinks he has enough experience to manage the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="83">&quot;Unfortunately, in June the General Assembly approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="84">&quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,&quot; Pelta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as bait to win over delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">&quot;If I am elected president, I&#39;ll take that as a personal challenge and am prepared to respond if this fails.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="87">&quot;It&#39;s a matter of principle, without which we can not exist,&quot; Pelta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Moreover, in theory, try not to mess with his opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">Already in the past had warned that looked Rajchl working with Henry, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">It had long without attacking Paclík Thomas who, unlike Pelta, left no stone cold.</seg>
<seg id="91">&quot;It takes more than a year in the football world and has achieved some success.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="92">&quot;Their attacks but were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="93">&quot;So many doubts about his true character,&quot; said his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">Your most powerful weapon, according to him, his knowledge of football competitions from low to higher.</seg>
<seg id="95">The latter should be a showcase for promotion of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">&quot;Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose from the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="97">&quot;Immediately after I get involved in negotiations with public and private, to ensure there is enough money for all the football,&quot; said two months ago to the candidate ČTK 46.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">Then also promised that his appointment as president of football does not entail any change of staff personnel.</seg>
<seg id="99">&quot;I should first know the tasks of each employee,&quot; he said of Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy prevails understandable nervousness.</seg>
</p>	
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predict that before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain Thursday to Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="101">&quot;If the only sticking point is how to vote in the third round, I would definitely be able to overcome.</seg>
<seg id="102">&quot;Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader,&quot; still two days before the most crucial time in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that under his leadership, FACR begin to work with enthusiasm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If the fourth General Assembly is elected Jindrich Rajchl the current vice president as president of the Czech Football Association, many people would show probably resentful.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that if elected, would work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">Want to implement systemic change and make the executive committee members are responsible for each area individually football.</seg>
<seg id="107">You also agree to settle the case of the Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work begun by former President Ivan Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">&quot;As president, I would devote myself entirely to football.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="109">&quot;Since international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, to professional football or coaching youth soccer performance.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="110">&quot;This is not to say I would do everything alone,&quot; he said in an interview Rajchl for ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">&quot;I am a team player and want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can engage in a specific area.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="112">&quot;And will assign difficult tasks for football can, in each of these segments, go ahead with great momentum.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="113">&quot;A lot of people this probably will not like it because it will mean starting work very hard and not just criticize the work of others,&quot; he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Because the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, is said to have considered the possibility of missing a candidate again.</seg>
<seg id="115">&quot;Everyone knows that working 20 hours a day.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="116">&quot;But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be people behind me to prevent and hinder me at every turn&quot;, explained the reasons for their indecision.</seg>
<seg id="117">&quot;Many people have told me I should not give up, because then would also overcome the other.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="118">&quot;This is not to abandon faith just like that,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">As they say, also motivates you to continue the work already started with Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="120">&quot;During those two years, was completed much of the work that I do not want to lose now.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="121">&quot;There are processes that had been started and will have an effect within a couple of years and I would not want someone to stop,&quot; said concerned by the fact that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the time of Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">&quot;I believe in order, and something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.</seg>
<seg id="123">&quot;Behind him is mostly all those people who would take care of football that was just a privilege for a select few.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="124">&quot;I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I am for someone.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="125">&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="126">&quot;I want to make a football for all, because only then will feel good everyone, not just the elect,&quot; said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.</seg>
<seg id="128">&quot;Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to make the most of Moravia.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="129">&quot;For example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division in a Czech side and another Moravian, whose winners go to the first division.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="130">&quot;Do not give the current situation where we have only three teams of Moravia, which is a problem for young Moravian players,&quot; said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Although the struggle of the presidential election Paclík joined Tomas, president of Club Pilsner, Rajchl not stop believing in their chances of being elected.</seg>
<seg id="132">&quot;I still have strong support from the Czech federation, which I chose as his vice president and knows that behind me are clear successes,&quot; said Rajchl, whose hits include saving tens of millions of crowns disadvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and the negotiations on the law of the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, recognizes its share of blame for the federation is not connected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">And while claiming that Pelta is &quot;disqualified to restore confidence in the Czech football,&quot; considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.</seg>
<seg id="135">&quot;No one can deny he did a great job for that year Pilsen.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="136">&quot;In the event that is chosen is likely to continue what we started Ivan Hasek and would not change significantly the number of staff on committees.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="137">&quot;I do not use that to my advantage,&quot; thus evaluated Rajchl rivals.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Jump to the blue</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">by Julia Stanek</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Pools from outstanding optics, sumptuous baths in Budapest: When visiting Europe can live their wonderful blue, and after a city tour or a walk, rest your tired legs in whirlpool baths.</seg>
<seg id="5">One book shows where the best being in the water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something he could not miss in your luggage, a swimwear.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lying back on the water, looking at the art dome on top, swimming toward the marble angels, who were waiting on the edge of the pool and was astonished at the indoor pool meticulously restored Art Nouveau.</seg>
<seg id="8">He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook when all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The architectural historian Meder explored over 200 swimming pools in this way and presented in his recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the &quot;concrete structures&quot; in Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">He made his &quot;journey through the most extraordinary bathrooms Central&quot; by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and city respectively Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">This 46 year-old German is a real fan of bathroom culture.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wants nothing to do with the sport, says Meder, only water is different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just upset that fans have to settle for the bathroom with blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans can breathe a fascinating run smell of pine forests or hear the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">&quot;One day I wondered why the pools have to be ever so ugly,&quot; says this resident of Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;I started collecting beautiful pools.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Doubling the water surface architecture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The splash in the pool and sauna ethereal oils. The feel good factor in the pools is so great because they serve all the senses, as Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the constructor endeavors, indoor pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of soil, in the bathrooms has a water surface.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;For one thing is clear, moreover reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="20">All bends optically: the high vaults, colored tiles, trampolines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The picture book in small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; in 190 pages provides very interesting data on the architecture and art history at the historic oasis of wellbeing, but mainly makes me want to jump into the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Meder, the collector of the specimens featured pools discovered in his research in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Besides the magnificent medicinal baths like Széchenyi Bath Budapest 100 years, are nitrates in waters with a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca) and baths, which are pools of alkaline water and are in a building shaped bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the city lays eyes on the indoor pool of Zurich, you can look Arlberb, snow cover from the outdoor pool for a swim in St. Anton, and: In Turkish bath is a window from which you can see the practice of the ski slopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The design, perhaps more extraordinary awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal water cathedral looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Three open source vapor rises in winter, while background Ötztal mountains rising on the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A Meder, the collector of pools, not invading the smell of chlorine in all pools.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many hot springs sulfur smell in the bathrooms of Árpád Bekescsaba, Hungary, the smell of diesel is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and silt which sticks to the skin to enter the pool, enjoy being in a special way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Iris Meder also disappointed in a place in their search for nice places for swimming, when he wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech Luhatschowitz bathroom, he found a land locked.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bathroom in 1902 by architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Meder looked through the windows of the building crumbling modernist red, white and yellow weed was growing between the tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The decline countered in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbald.</seg>
<seg id="35">These baths have three phases of construction behind him, not only can discover elements neorománicos of it was built in 1844, but also a style Arabic Alhambra hall, added in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">From their careful modernization in 1995, the Palace is the bathroom Thermal favorite collector pools, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;It has much merit different architectural styles merge into one unit so fantastic,&quot; said Meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a palace and immersion in the thermal pool apparently not very important.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Deutsche Bank discusses the business of raw materials</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Christian Teevs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">You give up the Deutsche Bank to its agricultural commodities business?</seg>
<seg id="5">According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to check the consequences of speculation to the world&#39;s poor.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg,</seg>
<seg id="8">For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable that banks speculate in agricultural commodities like wheat or corn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions to withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks bear the responsibility of the global problem of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The consumer advocate&#39;s campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although large banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Originally, bets on commodities were intended to protect traders from price movements.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leading experts agree that players have been decoupled from the supply and demand, and take profit of the costs of the poor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ackermann responded to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business &quot;worth compromising the good name of Deutsche Bank.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the report claims Foodwatch.</seg>
<seg id="18">The analysis should be completed later this year, then the results presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, together with a recommendation of how to handle it.</seg>
<seg id="19">In late January, the bank&#39;s management informed of the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the end there could be a reduction in income from raw materials, or even total abandonment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann tries to repair his image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;The stakes rising food prices show a particularly drastic how ruthless banks currently harm the public welfare.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann is found as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.</seg>
<seg id="24">&quot;Deutsche Bank should withdraw all investments in your portfolio to put in play money to bet food prices,&quot; said Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;No matter whether Ackermann addresses the issue of people going hungry or fame of the Deutsche Bank.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Inspection of Ackermann surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, Deutsche Bank reported that the chairman of the board will change something different from the unplanned on the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.</seg>
<seg id="29">And you need that cares little loss, that will deal with his successor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Two thirds nullify the investment in raw materials</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch strives to keep up the pressure on the manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, more than 30,000 Internet users participated in the campaign organization.</seg>
<seg id="33">On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only 10 percent considered legitimate for the Deutsche Bank offered investments in which to bet the price of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many bank customers showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments of the money comes out of land speculation.</seg>
<seg id="36">43 percent would advise against a bank and their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, upon reflection, cancel your account and change to another school.</seg>

<seg id="2">The flag moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A checkered history of architecture and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian World&#39;s Fair in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, it was empty and collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now reopened as a house of exhibitions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The architecture of modern postgerra passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials typical of the thinking on technical progress, for which the flag Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition 1958 Brussels is a good example and known.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzer Pavilion was then the Grand Prix for Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is considered to present a landmark of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">He did so well known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next world exposition.</seg>
<seg id="10">With its legendary tower of four cylinders to MBW more flattened an adjacent building in Munich, became internationally known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction exhibition arose after the Universal Exhibition in the Schweizer Garten near South Station in Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and opened a museum in the 20th century, was called the &quot;house 20 &quot;.</seg>
<seg id="12">The building was adequate but lacked the space and technology suitable for a museum, with no wall to hang art, not a good atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.</seg>
<seg id="14">The building is empty since 2001 and fell more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated hall, now called &quot;house 21&quot; and used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday afternoon the museum was inaugurated belvedere, which owns the house, with the first exposure, a windfall in a way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere since 2007, achieved a new beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, Ph.D. in art history with a substantial career, among other things, ice skater in her youth, later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, the reforms made to the insistence of politicians and protecting monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established use.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the exception of contemporary art, will exhibit work by sculptor Fritz Wotruba eponymous foundation, there should be a cafe and a bookstore and also built an office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict control, low budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because sensitively renovated secession Olbrichs Joseph in Vienna, expanded and was awarded the contest, but because Schwanzwer studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a &quot;huge and important place,&quot; which looked &quot;almost every weekend&quot; exposures.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his move to Vienna in his generous use change and ease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In current reforms there are major problems, the building was &quot;a devourer of energy,&quot; said Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">Changed the profile of the front windows of glass, insulating glass was installed glass fiber reinforced and replaced the glass ceiling by a special safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements are used for the new use, a panel of light descended from the house and street lighting provides a bridge to enter the building serves almost new, but still the flag of Schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">Original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in shades of antique mahogany and protected against oxidation.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the theater is exactly as before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all this with a strict control by the office of monuments and a low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">&quot;I often had to find material that is good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,&quot; says Krischanitz and warns of rough ground in the basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="33">The flag &quot;that came from Brussels&quot; has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical &quot;casual appearance in the history of the city.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="34">An architecture and is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and therefore wanted to &quot;raise adequate awareness.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened a lucky town. The all new and planned &quot;neighborhood station&quot;, with homes and offices, is situated by the Schweizer Garten.</seg>
<seg id="36">And maybe another stroke of luck happens: The house 21 could receive a booster Krischanitz another building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the Berlin art gallery and temporary, as it sounds, is negotiating with the city on a neighboring in the Schweizer Garten.</seg>

<seg id="1">The bank of Lake Zurich scandal</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The riskier bank of Europe is in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now led by a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Axel Weber certainly had not thought of.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his dramatic departure from the federal bank summit in July it was reported that in 2013 would begin on a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of directors of the major Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative career move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber is glad publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for their newfound strength and drop kind comments about their future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">&quot;The USB has been a revival.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="9">&quot;I am happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.</seg>
<seg id="11">A financial trader in London prevented all USB security systems and defrauded the bank 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The chairman of the board of the USB since it was considered equally touched, and all asked: When does Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It was learned that Weber must advise the bank since February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will take over the presidency of the board of directors in May, not early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This is hard for Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is a banker, rather, a professor of economics and advisor and has been an adjustment period probably necessary.</seg>
<seg id="18">Suddenly responsible for the strategy of a bank, you just try again deserves the title &quot;the biggest bank scandal of Europe&quot; in a while.</seg>
<seg id="19">First, the USB is huge, until recently was the largest global asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, glides to the next scandal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, so it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Financial crisis began.</seg>
<seg id="22">The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of discreet Swiss asset manager and solid, but also cunning, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.</seg>
<seg id="24">First, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This impressive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hans Geiger, the former banker and later a professor of banking at Zurich for many years, explains: &quot;With my students, I have always qualified to the USB as a model of a good bank.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="28">&quot;From the point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It was a big mistake.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007 came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.</seg>
<seg id="31">This summer, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very smart banker, surprisingly resigned.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some months later, the suspected reason.</seg>
<seg id="33">The bank&#39;s investment fund losses embarked on subprime securities and had to repay billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To carry this, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">For this, investors found naturally looked with some contempt until shortly before: Asian background and opaque state of Singapore and a state fund Arabic, so discreet, that he had never heard his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, continued the disaster, given the wrong investment, UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">The national bank purchased troubled assets to UBS for many thousands of millions, the Helvetic Confederation given six thousand francs a mandatorily convertible bond, by becoming part owner of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">All Switzerland was affected, said the drama that this was for a small country, if you are hosting such large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, total assets of UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland&#39;s economic performance (see graph).</seg>
<seg id="43">&quot;We can not go to rescue UBS,&quot; said Geiger, banking expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first catastrophe joined the latter.</seg>
<seg id="45">A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to deliver rich customer data, possibly using tax had defrauded the bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, approve a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with a severance payment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">This, UBS admitted helping more or less in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="48">Simultaneously lost something that had always been their capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the aura of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal, Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">This followed the resignation of the president of the board and the chairman of the board.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of client funds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Thus, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking with erroneous speculation and asset management with the help of tax fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when it was again something quieter, just when you thought that UBS again to get it, it happens this unhappy history of the operator, an individual trader defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And he revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with the management of risk in investment banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">&quot;With case manifests Adoboli risk that the controls have changed too little,&quot; said Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute, University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: &quot;The problem is that UBS does not dominate risk controls.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">So the idea of ​​caution, with which Swiss bankers had in a while, being guardians of the greater good of the world, no risk too great, however, the safety of money you want to break across the Alpine republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">Security deposits from Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, Lindt and Sprüngli as real chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The centerpiece of the UBS in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, just a little older.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is a classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank is headquartered in Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which runs from the main station directly into the lake of Zurich, framed by snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">Here are ostentatious buildings, rents are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Here are jewelers like Tiffany `s between traditional businesses such as confectionery Sprüngli Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="64">Live here for years Swiss banks: from the national bank, to Credit Suisse&#39;s palace, to the private banks elitarios as Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">You enter the lobby of the UBS by a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Within the walls are lined with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the bank&#39;s logo is a big sign to indicate the &quot;security&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Safety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse have been displaced at some point the idea of ​​the major Swiss bank, or betrayed, and writes the president of a small Swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all do, like all Swiss bankers, also with businesses both large banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS has become too big, says, mainly in investment banking, where whites have gained ground.</seg>
<seg id="71">That the Swiss had nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">&quot;And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">In fact, the UBS investment banking changed the Anglo-Saxon, gave his first big win and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost so much money in the jungle of high risk as the major Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was clear.</seg>
<seg id="75">&quot;That Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;The crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish .)</seg>
<seg id="76">Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How do you think of?</seg>
<seg id="78">He speaks with Swiss bankers, and see the problem in the dimension of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge in a powerful consortium.</seg>
<seg id="80">There is a bank that due to the merger, was too big for the little Switzerland, and growing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">As served to the two different precursors banks UBS complement: a bank rich but stayed with the center of asset management in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, internationalized investment banks came in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a financial bike.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">There are two names connected with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.</seg>
<seg id="84">&quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,&quot; said banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">&quot;Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, which means a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, who got the intuitive learning their way from the bank to the summit.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="86">Finally, he relied on Wuffli Ospel.</seg>
<seg id="87">And at the end Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: &quot;He thought that their models were a reality,&quot; says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">&quot;It&#39;s a tragic case.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">Is clear: The folly of the case came before.</seg>
<seg id="91">UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeating the same slogan: Get off the throne to Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">Topped the &quot;League Tables&quot;, rankings then documented the success of banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">The UBS wanted to be at the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps will go well.</seg>
<seg id="96">In currency trading and stock trading was at the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">However, responsible management consultants highlighted a weakness in the business of international interest in the language of banking &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is a huge compensation for the big banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill these gaps, UBS began an affair that almost cost him his life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, invested much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.</seg>
<seg id="101">It became a powerful machine to securitize mortgages and sell them to Americans then maintaining certain risks to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="102">Also, as banks sought the long descent.</seg>
<seg id="103">&quot;In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. housing market was on fire, UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, banking expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">So great euphoria, so deep the fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager had to leave because the attempt to order proved more complicated than expected.</seg>
<seg id="106">UBS posts in the seats became unsafe and are projectable to the present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.</seg>
<seg id="108">You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Geiger, an expert in banking, has an idea, put an end to investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">The bank does not want to go that far (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">But investment banking should be greatly reduced, it is clear now.</seg>
<seg id="112">The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present its future strategy to the world.</seg>
<seg id="113">In fact, only thought of the Italian-Swiss 51 years as a temporary solution, since the bank broke the bank of his predecessor surprisingly Grübel.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, he won: You must run permanently the business of UBS, the bank in Zurich on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti want to return to the investment bank to its mid-nineties.</seg>
<seg id="116">Deletes 3,500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But this is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">What would you like to earn money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that Axel Weber is safe now.</seg>
<seg id="122">So far only said that first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The following year.</seg>

<seg id="2">In many places the jays are considered &quot;problem birds&quot; not eject these highly intelligent animals of the city for a long time, experts say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">A few like them, very quickly want to get rid of them, the rooks years belong to the image of the city, but in many municipalities collect complaints from neighbors for the mess and noise of the animals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Although there have been no means against the &quot;bird problem&quot; so far.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rooks do not leave the cities, experts say the first symposium on crows in Leer, East Frisia.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, specialists from around the country discuss possible solutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Looking for alternatives in the cities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Environmentalists attribute the problems of the cities to rural migration of certain protected rooks, chemical applications in agriculture, just visible with traditional living space.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hunting, rising and falling buildings that host trees make life difficult for the birds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rooks are protected.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, and Read.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">There in 2005 made headlines negative press a controversial project to kill the crows flock to the district.</seg>
<seg id="13">Critics have described the hunting of animals by trapping and killing birds with sticks as particularly brutal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">&quot;Expelling and driving them away normally not achieved anything,&quot; said Werner Klover, urban planner and landscape of Reading.</seg>
<seg id="15">Water to shoot down the trees or nests are usually unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">&quot;Animals are diverted, large colonies are divided and distributed in other places.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Scaring imaginable only as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.</seg>
<seg id="18">&quot;We must live with them, and not catch them.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without the surrounding area, does not solve the problem in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Reading.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is possible a combination of repelling animals from residential areas and sensitive baits for re-settle elsewhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">&quot;Information boards rather than chain saws&quot; Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertising against in order to treat animals in a totally different: &quot;The best thing is that we can take a peak in the face with aplomb. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein on the teaching circuit of Ascheberger rooks, where signs provide information about the lives of intelligent birds.</seg>
<seg id="23">Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Jürgens also has their own opinion about the criticism by the sound of the birds: &quot;All are forms of communication, have much to say.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, the rooks not only use the resources to access snacks shale, but it made tools for use as resources.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="3">Here are some acting tips: Start gently this page and make it your bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="4">Get to know these people very well in the narrative fiction of Mr. Englund, and the dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon for those few moments when, as one of its men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">Mr. Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is written here is a rare book, which describes aptly as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains some notable names, major treaties or famous battles, virtually no ambassadors, journalists and elegant discussing tactics or material.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not so much a book about what happened, he explains, &quot;a book about how it happened.&quot; It is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">&quot;The beauty and pain of battle&quot; combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanical climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative staff.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people will become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some become prisoners of war, or lose their members, will go crazy or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives here as votive candles flicker on in a church a few new ones are added to the mixture while others go out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation from the standard history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was the only fatal trench warfare on the Western Front.</seg>
<seg id="16">&quot;The beauty and pain of battle&quot; moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives, one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids, the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.</seg>

<seg id="18">This book is a poignant, almost from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war engulfs the lives of these people as a natural disaster, hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.</seg>
<seg id="20">When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you&#39;re a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?</seg>
<seg id="21">Anyway who is?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one understands what is happening, why even have to fight this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;Lack of facts,&quot; says Mr. Englund, &quot;is filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">&quot;The beauty and pain of battle&quot; is individuals like Florence Farmborough, a British nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the fleet at sea.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters and other material already published.</seg>
<seg id="26">The explanations of their lives can be frightening or disturbing, but they are more lively in the accumulation of small moments, lost detail, Mr. Englund.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of these are about hardship and cope with what is.</seg>
<seg id="28">About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: &quot;Substitutes, substitutes everywhere.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;Substitute coffee, aluminum false, imitation rubber, bands of paper, wood buttons.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Keep talking ersatz food in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">Described &quot;meat made from cooked rice and mutton fat pressed (and topped with a bone made from wood false); snuff made from roots and dried potato peelings, shoes with wooden soles.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="32">There, he observes, &quot;837 allowed meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are about honor and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and shows about the war: &quot;You feel like, after all, this is what men are conceived and not to sit in chairs with a cigar and a whiskey, newspaper afternoon or a best seller, and pretend that this veneer means civilization and that there is a barbarian behind the front crisp and studded. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">But a British soldier realizes that probably will die, and nobody will know or will care.</seg>
<seg id="36">&quot;Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that could happen before the public,&quot; he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, it is awfully similar &quot;to a condemned secretly being strangled.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations are about a dying old Europe, and on new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">&quot;The conflict has become increasingly economic competition,&quot; writes Mr. Englund, &quot;a war between factories.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="40">Reflects the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the mass murderer ideologically convinced eloquent and good clothes clothing running his butcher shop while sitting behind a desk.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unexpected ways, so much ignoble behavior as heroic.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading service in the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">&quot;The grotesque expression of this can be seen gonococcal pus trade, the soldiers bought and smear their genitals thereby hoping to end up in the hospital,&quot; he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">&quot;Those who are truly desperate to rub it over his eyes, which often leads to blindness for life.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to its human task.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of short scenes reflects the way in which the war &quot;unleashed forces exceptionally uncontrollable extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="47">People begin to ask why their leaders are doing to combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Modern Memory by Paul Fussell, or novels like All Quiet on the front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.</seg>
<seg id="49">The volume of Mr. Englund joins a pantheon unconventional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book has one of the most devastating late I can remember in a work of nonfiction.</seg>
<seg id="51">Do not tell.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if he had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and been burned with a match.</seg>

<seg id="1">After a preliminary misstep, an assault planned to the minute</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of police were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be empty.</seg>
<seg id="4">The operation was kept secret except to a few senior officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, their presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were repeated episodes of recent weeks, as the spraying of pepper spray on demonstrators in violation of department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the &quot;squatters&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And so the police operation to clear the protesters Zuccotti Park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.</seg>
<seg id="8">The agents were prepared watching occupations had developed in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="9">A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye toward Zuccotti.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agents called training increased the disorders - involving counter-terrorism measures quickly mobilize large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The last training session was on Monday night in the Manhattan side of the East River.</seg>
<seg id="12">The orders came into the park in the &quot;last minute&quot;, said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as &quot;an exercise&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">&quot;A few cops I know who were called to this, they said it was to enter the park Zuccotti,&quot; said the person, who spoke anonymously.</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;The only people who knew they would enter the park Zuccotti were at the highest levels of the department.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.</seg>
<seg id="16">On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged soon after hearing about the plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Tuesday&#39;s operation involved police officers from various units, including special forces around the borough - dozens of mobile agents usually used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Mr. Kelly said many people as those who commute to work, had been coming and going of the park during the day, by 1 am a good time to enter.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;It was appropriate to do so when was the lowest number of people in the park,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with lights and speakers gathered at the intersection of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.</seg>
<seg id="21">The lights and prerecorded messages that echoed from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Community Affairs Officers went to the park with his blue windbreaker, many protesters simply packed up and left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Do not touch any store until 1:45 am, police said, allowing time for protesters to gather their belongings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to come if needed to make arrests in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paul J. Browne, chief spokesman of the Police Department, said it was for their safety.</seg>
<seg id="27">But many journalists said they tried to prevent the police saw into action in the park, and had been treated roughly by the agents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Browne said the television mobile units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, they captured images.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As the police moved westward through the dense tangle of personal effects of the protesters, including baggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic packed with clothing, equipment Cleaning Department followed, picking up what is left behind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Some protesters refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="31">A core group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen area near the center of the park.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Around 10 people at the center of the camp candaron between them by the arms.</seg>
<seg id="34">And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="35">The emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 am, said Mr. Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="37">The clearing operation was completed 75 minutes later, police said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.</seg>
<seg id="39">Most of the arrests were for &quot;disorderly conduct and resisting arrest,&quot; he said.</seg>
<seg id="40">The highest ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the uniformed officer in the department.</seg>
<seg id="41">Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives of the department, was also there.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Kelly, while he was present, &quot;was not directing operations,&quot; said Mr. Browne.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">A second group of agents expected along the east side of Broadway between Liberty and Cedar streets, where they had to enter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Barricades were erected in Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block south.</seg>
<seg id="45">From these positions, the police was extending beyond the perimeter of the park even Zuccotti.</seg>
<seg id="46">At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.</seg>
<seg id="47">There were 28 people on the northern perimeter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.</seg>
<seg id="49">Around 5 am, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheel of a police van.</seg>
<seg id="50">At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.</seg>

<seg id="1">The support workers union will sue the city for layoffs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of its disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, municipal district 37, in an effort to overturn the dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred seventy and two assistants from the school, parent coordinators and others who were among the lowest paid of the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for his refusal to permit last spring, the access of the city to fund health care by working groups to close its budget gap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing at City Hall last month, the Minister of Education, Dennis M. Walcott, said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A board member countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that the support staff of the school would be dismissed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">37 borough officials said they filed the complaint in writing, advising the Department of Education would be sued. He held a press conference Wednesday to announce the official launch of the application, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education as defendants the city, and has eight employees dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, like most of the attendees who lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city Law Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their specific claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft obtained by The demand New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, and that had been chronically under-funded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is noted that although there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P. S. 36 The district&#39;s budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrollment by poor schools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memo used the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, although &quot;over&quot; more often describes the act of transferring a payroll master of a school to a job whose salaries are paid by the office center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">&quot;Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,&quot; the draft complaint, &quot;not only over&quot;.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Seems to have finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="3">All that was needed was that the rebellion is successful, the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the U.S. involvement ended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Mass.), along with Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent-CT), applauded the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for his &quot;courage.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">&quot;This resolution is to honor the brave of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said.</seg>
<seg id="6">&quot;It is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and that never came to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">That left the U.S. mission a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress angry enough to criticize the handling by Obama of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell to the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now the Senate may be ready to act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the House Foreign Affairs Committee &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners participating in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Will he win the new measure the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or divide legislators as the bill made in June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top Republican on the committee.</seg>
<seg id="21">Place spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Across the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measure, sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), is the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other lawmakers have failed so far to get their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are duplicates - the same bill was proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations between them.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House only, and another handful that &quot;control federal spending.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of those bills are also identical, but give their sponsors - especially rookies Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the &quot;authors&quot; of the measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate voted a balanced budget amendment.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators voted for a nonbinding resolution supporting the idea of ​​such amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can accomplish, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (DN.Y.) wants to remove the two term limit for presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and healthcare, among others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as prohibiting flag burning.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some lawmakers also want to permit the setting aside of federal law, if rejected by two thirds of the states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As enthusiasts who have been members in proposing the amendments are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and had 66 in the 110th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990&#39;s, when members regularly had more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But there were far more successful then than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="39">The last amendment was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range in an act constituting in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) appeared on national television Monday night, he sang accompanied by Broadway Melody &quot;The sun will rise tomorrow&quot; and said he wanted to get more than they wanted to return to Congress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Appearing on ABC News &quot;20/20&quot; with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The program documented her difficult road back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passage from the front to the back of his head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Three months ago, came as a surprise to the House to vote on the agreement of successful debt ceiling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as &quot;difficult.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">When Sawyer asked how he feels, Giffords, 41, said: &quot;Pretty good.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special &quot;20/20&quot; of an hour, which aired the day before the publication of the couple&#39;s new book, &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords from the January 8 shooting.</seg>
<seg id="10">In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, she looks in her hospital bed, his head shaved and a long scar across his forehead.</seg>
<seg id="11">She can only keep one or two fingers erect, while her husband encourages her.</seg>

<seg id="13">A nod.</seg>
<seg id="14">A puckering of the lips.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then, his first word: &quot;What&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="16">Within days, Giffords spoke another word - &quot;Toast&quot;, a change request in its breakfast menu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Videos released by ABC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: Congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; by Cyndi Lauper and &quot;Free Falling&quot; by Tom Petty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, which does two hours of therapy every day, said he remembers the day of the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="19">Her husband said he was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the murder on March 12 when she stopped to ask first about the six who had died in the incident.</seg>
<seg id="20">The gunman suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, has been detained in a prison in Missouri and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The army faces increasing pressure to end the violation</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a historic hearing will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity in the violation.</seg>
<seg id="3">If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Private First Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she says she was raped by a teammate.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was October 2008 and was headed back to his headquarters in Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who had a pack of 12 cans of beer.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">&quot;It sounded an alarm,&quot; says Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the native Texan put aside their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought, no, is 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">&quot;It&#39;s Texas,&quot; he says.</seg>
<seg id="11">&quot;I wish I had listened to my instincts.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="12">Within minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached her from behind, knocking her down and raping her, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether the lawsuit have been filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape in the military, in violation of constitutional rights of soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Launched in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC, demand initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them say they were raped or sexually assaulted by their partners, and that the army it failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says he will by the staff of the army, because the problem starts with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;The army is a top-down structure,&quot; he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">&quot;Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also said that since February, have been in contact with about 400 survivors, many of which could be part of future demands.</seg>
<seg id="20">His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all your eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Court documents obtained by Newsweek, detailing the strategy of defense, in essence, that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">For a Supreme Court decision in 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.</seg>
<seg id="24">&quot;The alleged damages are part of the military service of the plaintiffs,&quot; the documents say.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Defense Department declined to comment for this article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 50&#39;s.</seg>
<seg id="27">While women are still officially banned them serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time to modernize the army also says Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She is not alone in their struggle, and three other lawsuits are under way, as well as yours.</seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School, Legal Clinic for Veterans Services is preparing a case against the four main military academies to foster an environment for allegedly misogynist.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, the nonprofit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder&quot; assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them of Service - a common occurrence, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati Action Network of Women in Service, a human rights group.</seg>
<seg id="34">His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There have been nine separate bills in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010 there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and the Pentagon&#39;s own estimates, which amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report, published in March, also examines the processing rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the army went to trial - half that of the civil justice system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Lyman, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.</seg>
<seg id="41">That night, he says, was asked to tell the details of her rape 11-fold different from a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her attacker, a cut on his arm was found in his bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he asked about who had had sex with her boyfriend the day of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people testified as witnesses on behalf personality of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">&quot;I remember the day when the verdict was read,&quot; says Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">&quot;I thought I was going to work, I ran screaming from the room.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="47">&quot;They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I came, I remember that I told my commanding officer,&quot; &quot;That was not his judgment. That was my judgment.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed with a personality disorder, which made them unfit for service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, was exempted from service under a less-than-honorable, so you can not receive any benefits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his colleagues demand continues, it&#39;s a long shot, said John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, he notes, &quot;In my opinion, should be able to move on.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.</seg>
<seg id="53">I&#39;ve been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The military is decades behind because it has the same incentive and deterrence raises the risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: &quot;The odds are heavily against them ... but it&#39;s important for them to try.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="56">These things only change when good people are willing to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If no hearing is on its way, Burke, attorney for the plaintiffs, the tail will make his other hundreds of applicants for future cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">&quot;We will continue fighting against the army in this issue for the reform to occur,&quot; he says.</seg>
<seg id="59">&quot;Or until we die, whichever comes first.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Breivik Behring was just another guy who aerated their views online anti-immigration.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to making a killing in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, he faced his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack against your computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in networks social.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how do you find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy - just log into Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">&quot;We realized that was not so difficult to reach,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, author of a recently published report on the digital populism Europe DEMOS British research center.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cache of personal information Facebook is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their demographic characteristics desired with scientific precision - the way that marketers have been using for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartlett&#39;s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and then I went advertisements, but instead link them to a new band or diet product, the ads invite users to complete a survey that asked about educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 fans from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.</seg>
<seg id="12">&quot;It&#39;s a whole new way of doing research,&quot; says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not entirely surprising: The online supporters of right wing groups tend to be young men and angry about immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, in a kind of rotation, &quot;those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems such as social trends are in the &quot;Like&quot;, messages on the walls and status updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content daily, the &quot;supernova data&quot; Facebook is creating a boom in research, boosting the number of academic papers with the site name in the title to almost 800% over the past five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that you can study the people who could not get close to a folder on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;Before, when people were trying to survey the British National Party, was very difficult to identify.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="20">&quot;You&#39;d have to go through the game, and they never allow you access,&quot; says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">&quot;Facebook removes all that - go to them directly.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having a drinking problem that students remained silent on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many status updates with their drinking.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;You can not treat a problem if you can not diagnose,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children in the Children&#39;s Research Institute Seattle, the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;We found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook is also constantly &quot;clicking&quot; their own population to obtain data.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Data Team has developed site statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine&#39;s Day, the expected turnout in the middle of the legislative period of 2010 and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that is accessible - Digital freedom advocates have long maintain that the site should make available to its many other research data).</seg>
<seg id="29">However, users of Facebook know that the site is watching over them, like it or not - the sacrifice to play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the mine site your personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey do not even know?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="32">&quot;I do not think many users have even thought that a researcher might be looking at their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab on a 2006 study conducted with the walls Facebook public students.</seg>
<seg id="33">&quot;As they were concerned, was just between them and their friends.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic that being completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know which part of the information a user profile and wall posts are true.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That&#39;s why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes a clipboard and pen are still the best research tools that anyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">&quot;There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to real people,&quot; he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">&quot;Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1">&quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Breivik Behring made his first public appearance in court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Behring Anders Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of &quot;resistance&quot; during his first public appearance at the court of Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway,&quot; he told a room filled with 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">&quot;I oppose the court, having received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="5">&quot;I recognize the facts but I plead guilty.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The judge interrupted Breivik Torkjel Nesheim during the monologue, because &quot;Breivik wanted to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their views.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, go to the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik custody for 12 weeks, barred access to the media for four weeks, and said officials would need to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some came hoping to look in the eyes Breivik, other to confirm that he is being held under lock and key.</seg>
<seg id="11">They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="12">&quot;I thought it looked cold and inhuman,&quot; a survivor of the station Utoya Norwegian NRK.</seg>
<seg id="13">&quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked to journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the strange notion of Breivik to be part of a movement of &quot;resistance&quot; greater, the judge determined that there is mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is possible that some people comfort that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist group rather than a radical.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that does not automatically softens the pain and confusion that still feels a whole nation.</seg>
<seg id="18">&quot;I&#39;d look like a monster, but it seems,&quot; said a relative of a victim.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;It would be much easier if you wished.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1">7 Lessons from the loss of Steve Jobs interview are shown in a theater this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were those who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Inventor Modern.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what Apple fans might find it more revealing, in an interview recently rediscovered Jobs which has been dusted off in advance of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, how many understand the creative mind of the processes commercial workflow products.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was definitely a designer, dreamer and autorreconocido hippie, but he was a meticulous organizer and a junkie flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered &quot;a disease that is a great idea to think that is 90 percent work ... [but] there is an enormous amount of work from a great idea and a great product. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (Triumph of the Idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for a long, strange conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time barely 10 years had passed since Jobs was forced out of Apple, and I worked hard on his new NeXT computer company, hoping the popular adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of the interview was used in Nerds Cringely said that the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was only after Jobs&#39; death it was discovered a complete copy on VHS in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This footage, slightly re-edited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, 68 minutes, which hits theaters this Wednesday and Thursday Landmark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone known to hate the interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And very thoughtful.</seg>
<seg id="12">In four different points throughout the interview, there are long silences between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is weighing his thoughts clearly, for accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also times when Jobs&#39; perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient with questions Cringely, pushing him to go faster or arguments to the issues of greatest importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there&#39;s something strangely prophetic in Lost Interview, when Jobs assess what other companies do you see good and evil, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.</seg>
<seg id="15">One thing to read reviews posthumous career of Jobs, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how they can and should do things.</seg>
<seg id="17">Not long after explaining everything in detail here, was and did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of seven sequences notable loss Interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Learned how to run a business:</seg>
<seg id="20">&quot;Over the years in the business, I always wondered:&quot; &quot;Why do things?&quot; and the answers you get will invariably are: &quot;Oh, that&#39;s just the way it does.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody knows why he does what he does in business no one thinks very deeply about things.</seg>
<seg id="22">That&#39;s what I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify the accounting for Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Puzzled by the way costs are recorded - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; that was done by guesswork, and then fit with a &quot;variable&quot; - developed an automated factory assuring that could determine the costs retail trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Joke about the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs tells the &quot;Blue Box&quot; that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack the phone company and effectively make free long distance calls.</seg>
<seg id="27">He has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wozniak describes how he tested the box and using a pay phone, a call, and then connecting from a network of AT &amp; T to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and shouted through the phone and returned a minute later the phone the next door,&quot; Jobs says with a chuckle.</seg>
<seg id="30">&quot;We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that would control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="31">We both did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I do not think Apple would never have existed without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to go to answer the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On a fascination with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years, hunting for parts to build a frequency counter, looked at Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a summer job part-time at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;That was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that had been formed at that age and my vision of what was a company and how well they treated their employees.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube screen, and I loved it.</seg>
<seg id="40">Get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Improvise on innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.</seg>
<seg id="43">Early in his career, as he sold a handful of motherboards, a customer asked if he could assemble the entire team.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working with only 30 days credit, had to figure out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, while at Apple, remember the struggles they faced in the development of a computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">&quot;I remember having arguments dramatic ... I cried it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $ 300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $ 15 and it was totally reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On large companies losing steam:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before Warren led the revival of Apple, Jobs prophetically foresaw the way many industry leaders stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">&quot;Say you work at IBM or Xerox, for what you do best copiers and printers, so what?&quot;</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly of the market share, making the company more successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">The sales and increase marketing success, so they are such people who end for leading companies and makers of the products are expelled from the forum for decision making.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius of the products that led to such monopoly rots because of people who have no notion of good vs. bad products products - knowledge of the trade necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">That&#39;s what happened at Xerox ...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It could have been ten times its size, could have been the Microsoft of the 90 ...</seg>
<seg id="57">They took the defeat of victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On innovation and artistic expression:</seg>
<seg id="59">&quot;There is an enormous amount of work from a great idea and a great product as it evolves ... great idea, it changes and grows.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="60">You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can not make them do the electrons, the glass makes the robots do the same, the factories make.</seg>
<seg id="62">You have to keep things in your brain 5000 - these concepts - fit all at once ...</seg>
<seg id="63">In the end it comes down to taste - is reduced to trying to expose you to the best human team has done, and then try to adapt those things that you&#39;re doing.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">We have never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">What in part made the Macintosh great was that people were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which coincidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">If not for the computer, you may be doing wonderful things in other fields.</seg>

<seg id="4">One case in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The justices agreed to admit the claim and, in fact, it is hoped a plea historic 5 hours to March, and the result is likely to further vitiate the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court&#39;s decision is known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The attorney will appear in court and allege that the law should be scrapped will probably Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has long been dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, representing a trade association that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing the court on the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among those attending were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican most important in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health care law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Are the special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It&#39;s nothing new: The two judges have been attending the Federalist Society events for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it&#39;s not something that conflicts with the ethical standards.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they are not, you could say that would fall under Canon 4C Code, which states: &quot;A judge may attend fund raising events for organizations concerned with law and others, although the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honor or included in the agenda of the event. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in the case, and a company with a huge financial interest was enough to alarm advocates of ethics in government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">&quot;This impressive gap of ethics and disregard for the code goes against the demands of various court judges who abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Cause Common).</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;The judges were thrown a fundraising gala with attorneys who have cases pending before the court.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="20">His appearance and assist in fundraising for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticism that too easily mixed court activity with the agenda promoted by groups like the Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Thomas&#39;s wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, which has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan served as solicitor general of the Obama administration when it presented the first legal challenges to the law in court.</seg>
<seg id="25">His critics have pressed for Kagan refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law to be impartial now.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan has not given any indication that they will do.</seg>

<seg id="3">Boeing also sells six aircraft to Oman Air Boeing Dreamliner, a deal worth over a billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Rarely is news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it is a transaction where the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft amounted to a record 18 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Is as large as the place where Boeing was ordered: Middle East, a gold mine for future growth in aircraft orders.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years in the Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Boeing announced at the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft by dollar value - 50 jets Boeing twin-aisle 777.</seg>
<seg id="9">The successful request came from the Emirates in Dubai.</seg>
<seg id="10">The airline also has an option to buy 20 aircraft, which would raise the total sales price of $ 26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show 2011.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11">Then on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called the Dreamliner, which boasts a fuel economy and better services for passengers spectacular.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sale price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">&quot;This is clearly a huge positive impact for Boeing,&quot; said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;The quality of these customers in particular is very strong.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Many Middle Eastern airlines are property of their oil-producing nations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not as harmful, because the country is making money with the rising price of oil.</seg>
<seg id="17">That&#39;s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders for flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">&quot;They have a natural protection,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The order of the Emirates Boeing solidifies leadership in the market for widebody aircraft and helps keep at bay the intent of your competitor Airbus SAS to invade his domain with the A350 airliner.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his bid for governor of Michoacan during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that the drug helped tip the race in favor of one of his opponents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">&quot;The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only to Michoacan, but for the whole country,&quot; said Maria Luisa Calderon in a radio interview a day after Sunday&#39;s vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">&quot;They threatened our candidates, our poll workers ... They took over the polls, set up barricades ... and ordered the people to vote&quot; in favor of the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.</seg>

<seg id="1">ADB urges Asia to help rescue the Eurozone</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare to help rescue its eurozone sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economies in the world had to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to speed economic recovery block and out through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe in a &quot;fair&quot; and said the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and resources to help Europe avoid a long-term crisis the global economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">&quot;We&#39;re all in this together.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="6">&quot;So anyone who can help Europe emerge from the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.</seg>
<seg id="7">&quot;Asia can be protected to some extent, but can not be immune.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="8">&quot;So if China and India can help, that is by all means.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent days, Italy&#39;s borrowing costs have shot up dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that could push the world economy into recession and has led to calls for major emerging economies to join the eurozone to help find a solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said the bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds rescue fund of the EU, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that &quot;India will do everything possible&quot; to help the euro as its own economy was now suffering the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">&quot;Nobody wants the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;We have monumental challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="16">&quot;Not an option, it is imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility in helping wealthy Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell to Europe to help the one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million living on about $ 2 day or less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">&quot;At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on vacation to the beaches and that does not go down well,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Lee Howell, managing director of World Economic Forum, also wondered why India&#39;s reserves were to be used to keep paying the many Greek public sector workers in jobs poorly managed companies and loss- such as railways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Mr. Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens to &quot;significant ripple effects&quot; throughout Asia.</seg>
<seg id="22">The forecast of the Asian Development Bank&#39;s 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the &quot;downside risks&quot; because of the threat in Europe.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Serious Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defense</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The defense secretary, Leon Panetta, heated Congress on Monday, warning that automatic cuts looming budget could undermine national security and cause a chain reaction from the financial corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, assembly lines to civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is digesting the 450 billion dollars in cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if Congress fails to reach agreement on the spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its sequel, the &quot;kidnapping&quot;, would result in 23 percent of global reductions and an end to many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">&quot;A cut that big, indiscriminately applied in this way would make the most of our naval and construction projects can not run - you can buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts &quot;Panetta wrote to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">&quot;Also we would be forced to set aside many of our civil servants and inadvertently, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it almost certainly would have civil license in order to meet the target.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="8">&quot;These changes would break faith with those who hold and would seriously damage our military readiness.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts in time to reach combat troops, Panetta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">&quot;While funding for wartime accounts overseas contingency operations not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be adversely affected by the severe disruption of base budgets,&quot; said Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">&quot;The recruitment would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and monitoring contract that supports the war.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="12">&quot;The staff on the payroll would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to providers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">&quot;The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline in U.S. main military power in the world.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;We are firmly against this draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published the letter from Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">&quot;This is not a result with which to live, and certainly not one that we impose on ourselves.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;Kidnapping is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If Panetta&#39;s letter and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although it reached a top job in the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that he faced difficult decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In a press conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but no nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="21">&quot;It&#39;s a ship without a crew.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="22">&quot;It is a brigade out of bullets.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;It is an air wing without enough trained pilots.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="24">&quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;It&#39;s a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;In effect, invites aggression ...&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an appendix to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the reductions &quot;generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters, severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed worldwide, and represents an unacceptable risk to future combat operations. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could face the ax, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">That list includes the F35 fighter aircraft Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the next-generation ballistic missile submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Stop additional development and testing of the F35 could generate 80 billion dollars in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to detect a lie</seg>

<seg id="4">The directors of the Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports said that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, was &quot;caught&quot; with an open microphone saying the U.S. president, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">New York Congressman and exhibitionistic Internet, Anthony Weiner, looked ridiculous with her denials quickly refuted by the proof.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign finance related to covering up an extramarital affair.</seg>
<seg id="9">And again, anyone who lived ever forget the media circus sparked by President Bill Clinton during his second term lie about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Are widespread legends about cheating in school exams and college.</seg>
<seg id="11">There have been cases where teachers have taken the test answers to students to be better seen in their performance assessments.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mentors should be teaching to the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How we are cheating?</seg>
<seg id="14">On any given day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.</seg>
<seg id="15">That&#39;s for sure, many of these lies are white lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Detect lies, or &quot;the location of lies&quot; is an essential skill that we must have all, for reasons both personal and professional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a board game similar to, say, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim: &quot;I have you,&quot; the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge would be based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades in prestigious universities conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One result of the research is that the old myths about the lie has been refuted.</seg>
<seg id="20">Liars do look at the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Not always stutter, stammer, blush or disturb.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Can not conclude either that the liars are difficult to detect or expose.</seg>
<seg id="23">A trained polygraph can learn the truth about the structure of the statement, the expressions microfaciales, the formation of questions and time.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years probing the scientific findings on deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help you navigate our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include recruitment, interviewing, or managing negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel at home, managing their own emotions and feeling of how intuitively perceived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, men say more &quot;self-oriented lies,&quot; while women report more lies &quot;others oriented&quot; - usually to protect someone&#39;s feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than people who are not married (but the lies that they say tend to be &quot;huge&quot;).</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a criminal, others will feel less guilty about lying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How to tell if someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, observe the subject&#39;s habitual behavior.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is called &quot;creating a baseline.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="31">Helps provide benchmarks to measure after the changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Note the position of the subject, laughter and vocal feature.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is better to know if someone taps his foot normally all the time to do when you see unfair accusations foot tapping in the middle of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then look for deceptive behavior groups, verbal and nonverbal.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these groups of behavior as a warning, not as evidence of deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People who cheat can freeze the upper body while trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, leaning toward an exit, change its position significantly or display a &quot;relief postentrevista&quot; - the exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position after all the hard questions are over.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interrogators are often falsely see the interview is over only to find that relief postentrevista.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">Scott Peterson screwed to the bottom and used the past tense while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for it nationwide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">People who cheat can also use a spacer language: &quot;I had sex with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat a difficult question entirely.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal cues are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Anyone can use a lot of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well ... in truth ... as far as I was ... in my opinion.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="43">This makes the answer is a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to discover the deception is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions, while appeasing the environmentalists - the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to re-route it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">TransCanada said Monday night that will move the planned oil pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive area in Nebraska Sandhills, and hopes that the project will gain approval.</seg>

<seg id="5">TransCanada&#39;s manager, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that over time the pipeline is approved, albeit with a different route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This comes after last week&#39;s announcement by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until further explore potential routes to avoid areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply groundwater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">&quot;This is a real way forward,&quot; said Rep. Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may separate any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials denied that politics were involved in the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama, in a statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed their full support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The pipeline would stretch 1,700 kilometers from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would take 700,000 barrels per day in the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">This would have to cross six states.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The rant of the singer of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; Monk frightened Genevieve, 18 months of age, both suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;increased their fear of strangers,&quot; says his family in the Supreme Court Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It was on November 10 last year when the stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">While the car picked Kevin Monk, Roseanna Monk down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with their baggage, leading to Genevieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Roseanna Monk said he stood by the door and put his daughter on the floor for a moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">&quot;Someone came up behind me and said,&quot; You know what you are doing your daughter? &#39; I said &#39;yes&#39; and I went to pick it up, &quot;he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">LaBelle warned pregnant women angry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">&quot;He said in an aggressive tone,&quot; I should not have let her daughter near the door, &quot;said Roseanna Monk.</seg>

<seg id="11">He was angry and started swearing - the C word and the word aloud J ...</seg>
<seg id="12">He had a bottle of water and started throwing water bottle on me. &quot;</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">Genevieve said she became hysterical.</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;I told this woman,&quot; Look what you did to my daughter, &quot;said the girl&#39;s mother.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">LaBelle pounced on the mother - who still held to Genevieve - and had to be restrained by their environment and retreat to a car that was waiting, Roseanna said Monk.</seg>
<seg id="16">The little girl was crying so hard he vomited, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls for comment on what happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family&#39;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money you get to an association of support for children with cancer.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">&quot;The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for their behavior,&quot; said Davis.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The replacement of analog signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Supreme Court&#39;s Office (Supreme Court) dismissed the constitutional controversies brought the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree ahead of the so-called &quot;digital switchover&quot; from 2021 to 2015, by failing to meet the eight votes needed to invalidate it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, including President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, said that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed its authority in issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With this result, the constitutional challenge brought by the Senate, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this is in effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The draft statement, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, because the regulation of matters of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A vote for the bill only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and to support the claims, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the decree and all actions it ready for the digital transition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The full ministers also decided to reject the claim filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In his speech, the minister president said not match the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive can not structure through measures of general rules to prepare public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">&quot;Nor do I consider that if I did it affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,&quot; and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the guidance of the State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The replacement of analog signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years, resulting in better utilization of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Postpone the change, he said, would delay the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, not only a technical dimension, &quot;it covers economic, social, political and national security.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">These issues, he said, &quot;require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of economic stewardship of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the state executive power.&quot;</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">As you may recall, Michoacán not homologated its Constitution and Electoral Code of the State or Electoral Justice Act, since Congress approved the reforms of the state shortly before the deadline so they could legally enter into force in this process election and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the periods specified in the Law of the State Official Gazette, arguing that he had some objections.</seg>

<seg id="8">Thus, the partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be on the assumptions that: the results of the records do not match, there is no counting the minutes and counting on the record from the box or not held held by the chairman thereof or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, the total count of the vote received in all fields of the election may take place when there indication that the alleged difference between the candidate winning the election in question and who obtained the second in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as the start of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that ran the second of the candidates mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The total vote count also be made if the end of the regular computation states that the difference between the winner and the candidate allegedly located second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided there is the request of the representative political party whose candidate came second, in which case the ballot boxes be excluded that have undergone partial recount.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Note that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 total records.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Italian Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a government.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats, although it is unclear when take over the new executive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said the president will present the results of his talks with political parties in their attempt to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">&quot;I confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country through this difficult phase,&quot; said the former European commissioner told reporters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti did not say explicitly that it can form a government but the tone of their comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The &quot;framework is now well delineated,&quot; he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti to approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain confidence hit in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, volatile markets put the yield on the benchmark 10-year Italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we would support much of this government.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success were boosted Monti considerably by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">&quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result,&quot; he told reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Support the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the majority government technocrat who is forming Monti.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Monti&#39;s new government must have a strong parliamentary support to implement the reforms likely to be unpopular austerity.</seg>
<seg id="20">Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a devastating new attack on the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian association of foreign banks were added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began Monday his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups as well as youth and women organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Round will end its meeting on Tuesday night.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed Napolitano on Sunday, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief respite late last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the Italian debt costs have now become critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti has said his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions of politicians only give you time to implement reforms before early elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist they must be trained technicians only an indication of his objections to a process forced by financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement being the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Have been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says that they too will become the dream of playing in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This was stated by bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The group is on the wing South American tour to celebrate two decades of work and on Sunday, 20 will make its only stop in Central America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p. m., with the band The X angelina and nationals of Las Robertas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This is an excerpt of the conversation, whose full transcript is online at The Nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To his followers Costa Rica is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what they are living their fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.</seg>
<seg id="12">I&#39;ve been to Costa Rica only once, on vacation, is a beautiful country and I think we&#39;ll be able to stay a few days there.</seg>
<seg id="13">So we are excited to bring our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.</seg>
<seg id="15">What do they tell their most fervent followers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you for staying with us through all these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">It took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long and sorry that it took us so long to get there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people even as regards their concert as the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Do you add that a bit of pressure on his visit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We played a few shows in Sao Paulo huge and we hope that we have put in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">Really, we are very eager to play there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we love to surf and jungle, to both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How did Costa Rica discovered its waves and surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are amazing.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf, that&#39;s how we learn, through people who love surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Seeing the tour, have been delivering huge shows with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What have you planned for presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Since we have never played there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="30">Try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs, try to play a couple songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat the repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">What is this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine discs and can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it&#39;s difficult to choose which songs they play every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not time to play, that keeps us focused and keeps us surprised that reminds us why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of experience.</seg>
<seg id="37">Looking back, is it hard to believe all they have achieved?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">First, think any of us imagine we&#39;d be in a rock band and have done for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue making music together.</seg>
<seg id="41">We all want and we love making music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are fortunate to go to places in the world who always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What did it mean for you for having been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It&#39;s amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, comes a band of a city, but much stranger is when five or ten bands out simultaneously from the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.</seg>
<seg id="50">I still play with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Mudhoney were in Canada, saw Soundgarden in his tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them yet and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that emerged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very strange that a band like yours to remain united with the same members for so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer lasting many bands.</seg>
<seg id="54">First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about others.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all very close friends and, through that, too musical avenues have been opened to give freedom to each experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">We trust each other with the music of each and could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but thanks to its success, have been able to do whatever they want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How to find a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">For as we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We ensure that not too on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of big crowds and people who love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">While one remember that people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what he brought, without infatuation for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How do you remember his other project Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think I write very good songs and at first it was something great.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were a band for almost three years and never published a disk until after the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">There were many frustrations because last as long and most important is that we are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and more.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an amazing man and we miss him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The national banda The Robertas be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that&#39;s why they chose to open?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, production videos sent us several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we&#39;re anxious to see what Las Robertas can provide live and should be very entertaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings and I think it does the first thing that comes to mind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">How bearish, what are your influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">There are so many.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the first that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...</seg>
<seg id="76">So many I could talk all afternoon about the bears that I love.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has Pearl Jam grunge maintain relevant despite being no longer a fad?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think we all always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think of it, reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came at the same time, and if there are important now, I think it&#39;s wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At first his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">Why this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It&#39;s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may appear lighter, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe songs that qualify as very dark but can sound a little positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With both, when Ed I touched them, I cried when I heard songs and are profoundly dark.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these two songs certainly represent that for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.</seg>

<seg id="1">¿Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects agree on the timing of the call beyond controversies over fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The municipal contest on 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In mid 80&#39;s at the height of the now defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration churned out leaflets promoting Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The booklet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, moved back to the park, in the minds of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​with the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south but up (mountain )-down (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The rating Collserola natural park is in this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the boar on the role of Yogi Bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">In these he was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for so many doors to Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door leads to the idea of ​​park, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that or someone tries to stem the tide.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question comes alone: ​​Collserola, ¿park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The competition, both in purely organizational aspect as representing the city of reflection on the topic of conversation among all architects of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It&#39;s almost as a theme to fall back on when two members of this ancient breed of elected are recognized in an elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few similarities between what locals are saying three architects, and academics, that have been presented.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldan, Daniel and Martha Mòdol Bayonne: the contest is timely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roland, addressed the coastline after &quot;it is necessary&quot; to discuss &quot;front mountain&quot;, since Cerdà&#39;s speech, that of green apples has not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;It is from the basis that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, its great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, &quot;says the architect to whom the title of&quot; doors Collserola &quot;contains a&quot; trap lexical &quot;do not have to think about them&quot; as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where action &quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mòdol, and Bayonne as natural disasters experienced in the urban world, called the proposal &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="23">Dangers of the &quot;uncertain project that is now public space&quot; after the experience in the 80 and had in the Forum area &quot;his swan song.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the very definition of borders on where to build.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;Limiting something is set and the next step,&quot; ie, its overshoot.</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;Think of new urban instruments, planning, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disaster.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">More adhered to the question, Mòdol believes that simplifying the slope vallesana Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, Barcelona, ​​not&quot; for a purely topographical.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mòdol remember that there is already work done by the Patronage of Collserola that &quot;should not fall on deaf ears,&quot; but appreciates the opportunity that the city offers its union involved in this project &quot;from the start.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="29">What&#39;s more, understands that proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; about whether this technical profile which should lead multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success&quot; , points) that have had to create: &quot;Architects should be only a tool.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayonne suggests that the answer to the question of the title of this piece is complex, because the contest rules lack a global view of Collserola &quot;16 competitions have been called cross-says-on-sea mountain sense, but there longitudinal reading, you see and understand the area as a whole. &quot;</seg>
<seg id="31">This results, at least in his case, which has elected to participate in 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in the program and definition of the architect of the next door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, yes, the council should ensure that the range immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety, an area of ​​equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) has announced that conducts research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called protocol &#39;Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence&#39;, which will provide markers associated with overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry, Specialties Hospital, XXI Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopez said that he joined a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The research is invited to participate in the population is entitled or not, go to the IMSS sport units participating in the Valley of Mexico, where he carried out the tests to children, every Saturday from 8:00 hours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He stressed that the protocol started in the sports Cuauhtemoc (Mexico State west) and since the October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Nezahualcóyotl (Mexico State).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once you meet the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Independence (south of Mexico City) and finally in Morelos Sports Unit (north of Mexico City).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To be held this November 14th on World Diabetes Day, said the goal is to bring together three thousand children between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and parental supervision for the implementation of specific questionnaires on diet .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They were also asked about physical activity and family history of disease, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">He explained that Saturday is applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, determining the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (seeks to identify genes that are associated childhood obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">&#39;Health Surveys 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase in the case of children, 77 percent obese, and 47 percent girls, in terms of overweight was also observed a dramatic rise, &quot;said the specialist in the IMSS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">He said the justification for the search of markers is based on the country&#39;s population differs from others by their genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Reported that the average Mexican is 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and African-five percent and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained that generally, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn off excess energy consumed (calories) and stored as fat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which can detect if they have some degree of overweight or obese.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Even he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz Lopez explained that there are three major components that lead to overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting watching TV and use means of transport instead of walking distances short.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Also due to the high caloric intake, ie, increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrate (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein and genetic analyzes in this protocol.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asphalt UNAM avoid potholes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry, UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with better performance regardless of environmental conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the signals sent by the pavement were addressed, it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of ​​Mexico, Najera said Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (CF) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the bumps could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his lecture A technological review of the bumps, issued under the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge of developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with a greater mechanical strength, both at high and at low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Nájera Herrera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt, the heavier oil is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, a high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high as 50 degrees Celsius has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that the resistance of asphalt streets is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to temperature and environmental conditions, said the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researcher observed that CF the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt, composed of small stones dipped in asphalt and then compacted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each of the stones which is the folder, he said, is bathed with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">When driving vehicles and generated efforts, it allows the forces are spread very well on the pavement.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it were modified asphalt would spread even better, said chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the asphalt, he added, place a final layer folder called rolling, which is made of a fine stone material, ie sand also bathes in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of vehicles, must have more mechanical strength than asphalt and provide friction on the road.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">As part of the pavement that is to receive and disseminate efforts, rolling folder also requires having the right thickness and must care for the material it is made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The weather, especially humidity and temperature variations are also an important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it affects considerably the performance of the asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the soil is wetted, water diffuses into the interior of the folder and is difficult to leave, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and therefore, the formation of bumps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear the film is rolling and is affected only after the asphalt, but the damage does not happen instantly, but a process that should be addressed at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Also a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be provided in relation to vehicle load and ensure meets, to avoid the formation of bumps frequently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair potholes with ease and without using high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="6">With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department and adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women who have been close vallecaucanas crown but were proclamations Ospina princesses including Miriam Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Bellini Patricia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garces (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Today the big question that many ask is: What was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the result is the defeat of a great favorite in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie Vogue, titles that were queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor that is considered key in the decision to designate it took the jury of First Princess is that not convinced with his answer to the question &quot;What is that book that has marked you and why? Made by Martin Gomez Murillo , the Literary Read Carreta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">At the Valle del Cauca interrrogante said</seg>
<seg id="11">&quot;I read a lot, I think a lot in the literature, I think it is a form of culturalizarse definitely think the book that I scored from childhood is&quot; The Little Prince &quot;is a pretty deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">Today I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is a book of literature we should all read, and now I&#39;m reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called &quot;The heat of blood&quot;. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A bit like the first response by &quot;culturalizarse&quot; and second for not explain in particular how each of the books cited have been marked.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Melina After the ceremony said he was calm and happy with the result &quot;the universe is wise to spend what has to happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all people, please read a little, &quot;The Prince&quot; is a great book &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among the hypotheses launched Valle said that the burned favoritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A reporter suggested that Bogota being the favorite, the acclaimed and the candidate took all preliminary awards (Oster food challenge, the public vote for the best traditional costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, the Queen stressed out and so did not shine on stage. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And it showed in his first appearance in a swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and two evening shows at the coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although both looked safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that Magdalena and Atlantic representatives did show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program &quot;Home&quot;, the RCN said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess &quot;finds that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not a queen.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle was very elusive to the latter with the press, and that was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of National Beauty Contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">For one thing, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of his country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">&quot;Beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, one must look beyond the physical and focus on social awareness, that before entering the contest are already involved in projects,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Valley is also speculated that he sinned by their defects in the derriere and fibrosis that it showed in his abdomen, but is contradictory precisely because the jury chose her as the candidate &#39;natural beauty&#39; with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The preparer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, &quot;but the problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, but the truth for me was not very noticeable, I got points on the last day.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, issue stickers considers the error of the Valle del Cauca were who underwent surgery.</seg>
<seg id="28">&quot;The surgeries are fine, but the Valley is not known to do.</seg>
<seg id="29">His body was never strong and here it is charged. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For this award, which delivers first National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suits came a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo Melina gave him not to give the like the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Reality or not, the fact is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives you the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for appointment of National Competition itself.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite its overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was elusive crown.</seg>

<seg id="1">This was the work of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A Cali lofoscopista made history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these officials is key.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On 4 November a CTI Cali lofoscopista made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC&#39;s top leader &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, through the comparison of fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the branch of CTI, this week it was the turn of &quot;availability&quot; to Eleazar Gonzalez, a man in Puerto Tejada who has 21 years working in the area of ​​judicial investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When you start your career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where they often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after making the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of skin friction, ie the palms of the hands and feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar warned to carry clothes for three days minimum.</seg>
<seg id="9">Something big was coming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On Friday night he went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="11">I knew I had to identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was the man who led the world&#39;s oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to take the card tenprint of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, it was very different from that seen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was clean-shaven, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the prints do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accompanied by a magnifying glass Galtonian, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the card.</seg>
<seg id="16">His eye did not fail him: he was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, yes it was the top leader of the FARC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In search of the fingerprint</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For a fingerprint of the Cali Sijin recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos Gonzalez Eliazar in the press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot; is very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people not familiar with our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopistas support research for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured.</seg>
<seg id="23">When captured, many criminals have false identification papers or no papers.</seg>
<seg id="24">We will take the fingerprint and seek in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The researcher said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall of a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to take a safe full of jewels and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">&quot;The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print, but then we get the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in several robberies,&quot; he recalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Traces may also dismiss or affirm suspects in homicide cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">I recently found a man dead, with liquor bottles around.</seg>
<seg id="29">Through the investigation it was determined that a family could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle match.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer, other places it in the scene.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A fingerprint expert explained that CTI objects &quot;traces are removed with chemical reagents or physical.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="32">When they appear, is used to lift transplantador or tape.</seg>
<seg id="33">After that, the prints are sent to Asif, who is the criminal database, or the Registrar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">&quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&quot; said CTI expert.</seg>
<seg id="35">He clarified that not everything is as shown in the television show CSI.</seg>
<seg id="36">And not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch turns footprint.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, if may be used, if the comparison is performed in question.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ending the spiral of falls that began in March</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake, resulting in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe suffered by the country Nippon since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="4">Early government estimates the material losses amounted Tokyo at 300,000 million, a blow that despite the difficult global context, seems to have dimmed.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of GDP between July and September helped to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the fastest pace of growth since the period January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery can be explained in part by the surge in the purchase of machinery to restore areas ravaged by the earthquake and ensuing tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% versus 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted gains.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="9">However, the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse invited to take advantage of crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the gaps to grow from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan has aroused mainly by domestic consumption trends, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.</seg>

<seg id="10">This could manifest itself in the Lisbon Treaty changes to allow strengthening oversight of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to &quot;give a face to Europe. &quot;</seg>
<seg id="11">In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly thought of Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Indeed, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven reach rapid agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU Nicolas Sarkozy seem to know that too.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the ball is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, delegates have overwhelmingly rejected the proposed weighting of each country of the European Central Bank policy based on the weight of each economy, which obviously would strengthen the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Eager to calm the situation within his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither is it who has tried to win over its congress at the expense of &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The incidence of fraud in sick</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sickness.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a cash charge of family allowances and a speech on the subject, appellant since 2007, the fight against social fraud and assistantship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition, to accompany such an offensive, that part of the will to save a rigorous, yet reminiscent of a shaft straight presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of absence before you can take the floor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In short, unless a specific enterprise agreement, a worker who falls ill lose four days&#39; pay, ie at least 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is a move that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, other measures would be accompanied with a more symbolic officials impose a day of absence without pay if sick leave (so far, have no lack, before the three days that are applied in the private sector) .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these issues are discussed, most put back on the table also the issue of fraud, this time facing the abuse of sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">&quot;They will significantly increase controls and also, if someone is caught committing fraud, shall repay the amounts,&quot; said Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday November 13.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of ad look slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud relating to sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, since 2002, keeps constant track of this issue and have launched several offensives policies typically have borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French did not sicker than the rest of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Look closely, first, the national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM) in 2006 were paid over 237 million in sick leave benefits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in health economics, subsidies accounted for the low in 2008, 5% of health expenditure, amounting to 11,300 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, 46% corresponds to the maternity and employment injury, while 54% is related to sick leave, rising to 6,200 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus, 2.5% of health spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">A sock that undoubtedly hides deviations: Another survey, published in 2007 by professional management Syrian Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said that they had not taken a single day of sick leave .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, in this case the Assurance Maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sickness absence lasted less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a months, 15% of one to three months and 11% were longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In comparison with our European neighbors, French workers are no more likely than elsewhere to take sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="23">A large study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence from work (both for health reasons or otherwise) ranged in France, between 10% and 11% , compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Fraud in sickness absence is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id="25">Fraud has a rather limited scope.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused checks sickness absence of more than 45 days are systematic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, 1.5 million visits, the CNAM found in 13% of the 285,000 made, that low short-term were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, ie 37,050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of lower than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were &quot;properly adapted or unjustified, a figure that, with the game a total of 1.2 million, amounting to 132,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Therefore, reaching a total of 169,000 cases &quot;unjustified&quot; among millions of workers who took sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="30">Undoubtedly, an insignificant in comparison, for instance, with work in black.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, ​​author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue between 9000 and 15,000 million euros a year, ie more than the total cost of the benefits low and certainly considerably more than the fraud in the latter area.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">An expert committee says they should legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Canadians living in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Canadian society lives denying death.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to your doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make provisions to that effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethical, legal and medical.</seg>
<seg id="7">This committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient raises the option and has been judged competent to make the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">To begin, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to address the issue of death.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them just died in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, the highest rate recorded in this sense, Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Regarding the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&#39;s authors came to conclusions that do not match the federal government&#39;s position, which has already declared that they want to change the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not a criminal offense, there is no proof that that not considered a criminal offense has not caused a abuse of its application, ie, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not competent or had not consented.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, said yesterday via teleconference, on the contrary, most excesses were observed in those countries that do not have legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">&quot;In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadian pro-euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, as saying that would allow people whose death is close alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">Additionally, 66% believe that the failure to legalize euthanasia will not understand that the life of the elderly and disabled have less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that there should be a process against them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In relation to the maintenance or disruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not as clear as the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, its recommendations suggest that indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of healthcare, if legally rejected, not a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="24">The expert committee also calls for the formation of health professionals on duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is widely used in health institutions in Canada, the Committee requests that, except that serves to reduce physical pain, is considered as euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other experts have reservations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as &quot;extreme&quot; views of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it limits the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">&quot;This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of life and has more than 18 years may request assisted suicide,&quot; said Deschamps, who presented a summary of the report yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Deschamps also notes that the report&#39;s authors seem to give priority to personal autonomy over all other values ​​of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">But he adds that &quot;in society, there are labels and limitations.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The specialist health law Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; regarding the conclusions of the report, calling it &quot;manifesto in favor of euthanasia.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts into question the lack of abuse especially in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="2">Introduction of a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget in the Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The grand coalition government of Social Democrat / Democrat is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign rating of Austria part of credit rating agencies (AAA).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Social Democratic Chancellor was himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a cabinet meeting, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly less than the debts of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">&quot;If it would reduce the solvency of Austria on one level, from AAA to AA +, would have to pay 3,000 million euros more in interest every year,&quot; said Democrat Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Austria is responding to a request from the Brussels Summit member countries of the euro area last October 26: here, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, reducing deficit and restore balance of public accounts in the Constitution or a law of equal value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the &quot;German model&quot; since Germany was the first European country that adopted such a &quot;rule&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Before 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% annually on the GDP, while the regional states and the municipalities, should present balanced budgets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The goal is that by 2020/2021, public debt is reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.</seg>

<seg id="5">On Tuesday, the yen rose to reach levels close to the highs that caused the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the yen, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to U.S. currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But the yen has been going up steadily ever since, driven by investors buying it as a &quot;refuge value&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The dollar quoted again on Tuesday to below 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic bar 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the &quot;economic fundamentals of Japan.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the BOJ said it had taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot;, implying that one should not expect further monetary easing on Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="16">At its last meeting in late October, the increased bank of five billion yen (47,000 million) purchases of Treasury bills, leading to the 55 trillion yen (519,000 million) the threshold of the funds that engages in the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the market with liquidity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Energy policy:</seg>
<seg id="2">the facts must be worth more than the dogmas</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If there is an issue that can not be treated taking into account short-term considerations or just thinking about the emotions, is energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is appropriate that an election meeting is a time to reflect on these issues and on the role of nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will be useful only if you study all the economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must base his opinion on objective facts in rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Now that we are 7,000 million people worldwide, demographic change will mean a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless otherwise deprive a huge part of the world&#39;s vital.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, we must alleviate the increasing shortage of fossil resources to keep producing electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, an issue that has vanished from the debate ecological.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fukushima&#39;s accident does not modify any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, Germany stands alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is not the case or of Belgium, who submits his to the need to find a source capable of replacing, or Switzerland, which only aims to build next-generation plants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, go ahead with their projects with determination.</seg>
<seg id="14">The U.S., meanwhile, after Fukushima decided to add a drive to your park, taking up the construction of a disrupted following the accident at Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, based on renewable energy, sometimes presented as an example, the reality is against such a discourse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will mean a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence for the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions from the construction of gas plants and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">Within months, the adverse effects will be felt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">You must meditate on the case of Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="19">European Champion in the wind sector, which gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind, therefore, CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% ​​and 50% higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the perseverance of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electric bill 40% higher than that of French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and guarantee the maintenance of the utility industry in the country, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in electricity prices, which detract from realism to the wonderful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and defending our purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a price that most of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, show no principled opposition to that kind of energy, polls show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Recall that the energy policy of our country has lost an industrial building with 125,000 jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs manager.</seg>
<seg id="25">Largely export oriented, it covers a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and create jobs that can not be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France decides to abandon nuclear energy, would mean the sacrifice of many of these SMEs and the loss of 6,000 million euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">What an EPR electrical charge designed to work sixty years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer?</seg>
<seg id="28">To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity, any more than there is a diabolical source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict control and transparency on both existing plants and on the construction of Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.</seg>
<seg id="33">In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one, at Three Mile Island was in normal operating conditions, did not cause or consequences to persons or to the environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and about unpardonable human error.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which killed tens of thousands.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as did the previous two.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Thanks to these developments and cooperation between security authorities and operators and builders French and German, the EPR has a design able to withstand such events.</seg>
<seg id="39">As you study all electric players who want to build a plant, the disruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF&#39;s competitors, since they leave the way free to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvering dominate such an important debate to the economic, social and financial of our country.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Immigration, does a burden or an opportunity for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from different points of view: the saturation of law enforcement, judicial and administrative policy under the figures, the compatibility of this policy with a self-proclaimed status of &quot;country of rights human &quot;in France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students has jumped to the holders, the Minister of Interior (see newspaper Libération 23 May) passed proclaiming that France &quot;does not need foreign talents, workers and waiters.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="4">However, rarely is analyzed from the economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The point is that, on this subject, there is enough consensus between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">For the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation in 1976 stating that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers,&quot; while on the left, set the tone as Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;can not take care of all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, both left and right shared fear of invasion of national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.</seg>
<seg id="9">On both sides, it is considered that immigrants are a burden on the economy and French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its program, François Hollande only includes trivia, indicating that the co-development will solve the &quot;problem of migration.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of ​​immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps electorally profitable, but is very costly economically.</seg>
<seg id="13">As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that summarizes the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.) there is broad consensus among scholars about the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The limitation of immigration undermines growth and hurts employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly low-skilled, pushing for a reduction of their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for local workers and professions engaged mainly in sectors with unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Low-skilled migrants working in sectors that do not attract national workers and more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not satisfy the demand for labor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country with lack of anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter have a positive influence on wages and employment of nationals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Given this, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase of migration flows is a rise in real wages in the long run of between 0.6 and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And, regardless of the fact that immigrants bring diversity contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized U.S. Nobel laureates and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Immigrants also are net contributors to social systems, since they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organization estimated, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years made a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of € 150,000 on public budgets on average during a lifetime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Early in his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to find the points of growth that was missing &quot;with teeth&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="25">These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="7">No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, organization, control and separation of powers, an education, Lights, economic solidarity and social justice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The crisis we are living in Europe is an economic crisis, but is about to become a political and democratic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">The recantation of the referendum was true-false Greek in this respect, revealing a double effect: it showed the need for a strong comeback from the political sphere, but also the disturbing sense of the impossibility, in his inconsistency.</seg>

<seg id="15">There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, would not know where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe.</seg>

<seg id="17">The whole of Europe is suffering the humiliation in the international arena.</seg>
<seg id="18">We care about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe is slowly losing the sovereignty and with it, each of their nations.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">The most urgent is that popular sovereignty recover the helm of the European project.</seg>
<seg id="20">For only together can the Europeans to reduce the weight of debt, free markets and prepare for their future through investment.</seg>
<seg id="21">The output of the crisis will require decisions at European level can not be taken without full democratic legitimacy unless it is to lead to disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Having long struggled against this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now asks European economic governance.</seg>

<seg id="5">&quot;The way in which both organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that they are cooperating,&quot; he said, without providing further details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger in January would have resumed the runways.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by persons connected with AQIM, Antoine Vincent Delory Léocour and died the next day along with several of his captors during an operation launched by French special forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chip belonging to terrorists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Terrorist Axis</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study indicates calls made to various partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers caught especially the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, home of Boko Haram, and the other a man who supposedly is close to AQIM and the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">&quot;This is progress, but certainly we expect to have more formal tests before we talk about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;But it&#39;s possible.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support abroad and is increasingly active,&quot; says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In recent months these &quot;supporters&quot; had become increasingly evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and the same style as those used by AQIM.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pushing to Abuja to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time considering the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A quick success</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, &quot;Western education is a sin&quot;), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the north Muslim Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success.</seg>
<seg id="22">Becomes politicized and demands strict observance of Sharia, while its members are released to the fight against the central government ungodly.</seg>
<seg id="23">These are aimed primarily to churches, bars, administrations.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and multiplied attacks against police stations.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reaction of Abuja was, as usual, general.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army attacked the city and there were 800 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yusuf Mohammed, arrested in life, received the death in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since then, more radical sect and abandoned their strongholds in the north.</seg>
<seg id="29">Last Christmas, claimed an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuja.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, Boko Haram attack again against Abuja, particularly protected against the headquarters of the police, a suicide attack, the first of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became his first international goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, stretching from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, restless all security specialists.</seg>
<seg id="33">While AQIM attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali Al-Chebab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram as a new threat emerges in the center of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to &quot;share all the information.&quot;</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The World According to Republican candidates for President</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Regarding China, with Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic?</seg>
<seg id="4">Listening to Republican candidates for president, voters might think so.</seg>
<seg id="5">For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are becoming more thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strength.</seg>
<seg id="6">They range slogans, often infundamentados on China, Iran, aid to Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination by the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce &quot;by manipulating its currency,&quot; a key issue in an exasperated by America migration of entire chunks of your industry to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">No matter if it means the explosion of a trade war, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost choked with an attitude that &quot;overwhelms&quot; the emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Requested a strong dialogue, but constructively with Beijing (the current position of Obama).</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman, who get stuck in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Reagan-style</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;If I&#39;m elected, I will stop Iran,&quot; he bragged.</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;If Obama is re-elected, will have the bomb.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="16">Also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed their duties in relation to that partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest ranked candidate, meanwhile shows a shameful disregard such issues.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently urged to counter China&#39;s military threat because Beijing &quot;aims to develop nuclear capability,&quot; apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.</seg>
<seg id="19">Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he, meanwhile, is ready to deploy U.S. forces in Mexico to fight drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="20">The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also advocated Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are considerable differences with the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Opponents counter that the current President Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.</seg>
<seg id="23">Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">They insist, rightly, on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; of Iraq and its distortions in Libya, and labeled as weak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But the attacks are not simple.</seg>
<seg id="26">People judged a rather positive balance Obama&#39;s national security, which ended with bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="27">From Iraq, wary of military interventions that generate a sink.</seg>
<seg id="28">And, arguing that America needed to revive economically rebuild its leadership, Obama seems to be more fair.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Nord Stream, new front door for Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly to Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea bottom has already been commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gas be supplied to meet the needs of thirty million homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a fine buffet, at the opening of Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under Sea, Russia and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, together have turned the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas network Western Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new pipeline will arrive each year 27.5 million cubic meters of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through the first was of 1,224 miles that connect the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube should be completed in late 2012 that will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, ie, enough to cover the French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube by the same route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents an air of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the Nord Stream will allow supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding over land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening to block his access to the markets of Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a &quot;new Germano-Soviet pact,&quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the price is a weakening of European energy, since the project has created a gap between the European East and West.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has managed, in just five years, to succeed his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with reserves dwindling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">&quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us,&quot; confirmed François Fillon at the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating how big contracts in the gas sector are as politically and economically.</seg>
<seg id="20">All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tube is made of steel submarine cement coated to protect against ship anchors.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It also became necessary extreme measures of protection of fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long metal snake weighs 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted along its length, either by valves, or for maintenance stations.</seg>
<seg id="28">He provided a control platform in Swedish waters, but the project leaders renounced it to see that the Swedes were unwilling to allow a Russian state company was established permanently in the sea off their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;In case of failure, interrupt the flow of gas in less than a minute,&quot; says Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In case of leakage, the gas pipeline is released, therefore, to the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the builders considered unlikely that a leak occurs, as planned joints that are projected to have a flight every 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">State control of the pipeline is ensured by a robot submarine, carried by a ship, which carries out inspections outside and through a device that circulates inside the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">With a pure form, is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, to provide accurate records possible deformations of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline is designed to run for fifty years without any servicing.</seg>
<seg id="36">Gas circulation is ensured simply by pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">The top is 200 bars and 100 bars output.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leader is Gazprom, which holds 51% stake.</seg>
<seg id="40">She joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and operating the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">Headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favorable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Then that company Gazprom rented for a period of twenty-five years renewable, the total transport capacity of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">&quot;A Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transport,&quot; says Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the pipeline construction has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the work should reach 7,400 million euros for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But minority shareholders are assured that their investment will not exceed, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of the expenses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted pines.</seg>
<seg id="50">Valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the output port of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">There are sensors that measure pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of gas on arrival, before being transferred to the German gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Founded half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for writing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular pasta, its rubber, its off-white sheets, and aged by time.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Moleskine notebooks were born with the current look ... in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mode Mode The Italian company, based in Milan, decided at that moment to launch a notebook design, but distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maria Sebregondi, who was then a consultant to the company, was responsible for launching the new product.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book is inspired by an ancient technique of production, mole skin (mole skin), which refers to a painted cotton was used, among other things, to cover the sidewalks.</seg>
<seg id="9">This type of book was highly praised by writers and travelers.</seg>
<seg id="10">&quot;Moleskine has adapted to modern tastes and forgotten an old object, an icon of the avant-garde artists to the twentieth century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, which since then became responsible for the brand in mode mode.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">And achieved success.</seg>
<seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.</seg>
<seg id="13">Production has been far confidential the early years, in which only 3,000 books were designed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moleskine goes beyond Italy&#39;s borders and exports its products to 70 countries from France to America.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.</seg>
<seg id="16">Like the Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its inception, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and one in New York.</seg>
<seg id="18">Distributes its books in bookstores, from the Fnac to small businesses in the inner cities, and has learned to establish their identity.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of e-mails,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi.</seg>
<seg id="20">This firm culture goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects and artists exhibit their own notebook.</seg>
<seg id="21">In August, also launched a notebook with leopard caps to mark the Locarno Film Festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Building on its success and the cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify their products: bags, notebooks, pens, computer cases ... The brand covers a wide range of media.</seg>
<seg id="23">This success causes envy in autumn 2006, Mode mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, to be written a new page in the history of Moleskine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers is still so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 19% of disabled people are seeking a job.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fifteenth week for the employment of the disabled begins today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a resolute public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people double the average rate: 19% versus 9% for the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Discouraging ¿?</seg>
<seg id="6">&quot;No,&quot; said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.</seg>
<seg id="7">&quot;The progress made since the last fifteen years are considerable.</seg>
<seg id="8">&quot;Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than average.</seg>
<seg id="9">&quot;However, there is still much to do.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It is noteworthy that the unemployed disabled still face numerous obstacles in accessing employment.</seg>
<seg id="11">They usually have a later age: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a slightly elevated level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is, there are many difficult issues especially the return to work and that &quot;constitute the crux of the problem,&quot; said Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These are the objective obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, there are those that are not mentioned, the mentality of people moving, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study conducted in April by the Association for IMS-Entreprendre Cite respondents stated that the directors have &quot;a level of knowledge about disabilities under&quot; with an &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of recruiting 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of ... 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the latest figures available, dating from 2008, reaching a ratio of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">&quot;Now reach around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof: the establishment number &quot;under this provision&quot;, as the amounts paid have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">&quot;The 2005 law that increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among large groups.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Labor, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers with employees with disabilities in its workforce, compared with 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.</seg>
