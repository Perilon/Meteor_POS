<p>
<seg id="2">In the article, how can learn the introductory estilistas, because I complained un poco that initial ya lessons were quite charged.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had no idea how to run things.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conferences three officers working in the industry, to people how vestir problemáticos y, moreover, a seminar sobre how it works in the entertainment industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It will be peor.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer they are final examinations, more information and tareas prácticas ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Although the current y develops each sábado y Sunday, no longer has a pin.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are vez have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course, there is no man) on how vestir to the woman who has no simetría perfecta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Y that is the great majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone is cuellicorto, anyone has a feature stylized sin curves right and someone sufre sobrepeso.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hairdressers know suavizar ópticamente unos to prolong a broad shoulders, neck o recrear curves necessary</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We have been given certain trucos sobre how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, of pechos y caderas huge pero waist close and at the same time not vestirla in a way too challenging</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Si, for example, the difference between the waist and the caderas is all que skirts o trousers are not appropriate, it is worth asking sewing at least an extra trozo patches to measure.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sin certainly will not regret, because the clothing that sienta perfectamente is invaluable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">With a skirt to measure sentirá much better than with a question which not to move, stand up, danced in the waist, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The body stylised se puede permitir vestir ropa with pliegues, ornaments, embroidery o drapeados.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are certainly many types of information and of bodies, so I am pleased that we have all week to poner orden in my all this information.</seg>
<seg id="18">And even then, I fear that the task assigned tengo, because more than adequately.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">To each participant in the current has been assigned two famous, that he will have to devise two vestuarios: one for the day and the evening otro para.</seg>
<seg id="20">We need to take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion than se tailored to the person in question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I was vestir » to Miranda Kerr, perhaps you speak of the campaign of Victoria 's secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Cry for inside, that to me is a lot better than, for example, Britney Spears o Christina Aguilera, which recently have fattened unos 100 kilograms (in favour, will take into account the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Dresses tenemos que recortarlos of magazines o later on the Internet and imprimirlos after drawing them graphically.</seg>
<seg id="24">The moodboard, which is as it is called the outcome is complete, expresses up our personal style y nuestra relación with the graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is also important to pensar in the chart in the styling.</seg>
<seg id="26">The hairdressers, therefore, not viste solo physically, but is also involved, for example, of the pages of products in the magazines (specific topics, as trends, handbags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">All of this told us the hairdressers y designer Mario Kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pero todo this is already para Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The hairdressers has have global.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The three guests specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on todo tipo of bodies.</seg>
<seg id="31">The hairdressers Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka y photographer of fashion Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the hairdressers should saberle sacar partido to this.</seg>
<seg id="33">Un y good hairdressers sabe trabajar with the same prenda dress in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variability is, in this case, central.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So, the gabardina (or as they say in English, trench coat -) can be vestir to classic with vaqueros y T - shirt, but also serves to vestir the naked body with of zapatos tacón y fotografiarlo as if it were in fact a vestido.</seg>
<seg id="36">O well enough arremangarla y subir the neck for obtener una totally different picture.</seg>
<seg id="37">« Jugad this ”, he insisted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">What more valoro Council is the following: “ to begin to work, it is essential that you speak primero todas the rules ”.</seg>
<seg id="39">« Then podéis romperlas » Jakub, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Por so it is clear why memorizamos todas these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it in magazines resultados we are different.</seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention the parades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that hairdressers tiene que tener more types of clothes in the reserve aimed at taking photographs.</seg>
<seg id="43">So, for a history of fashion than tenga ten pages (so, ten outfits), we have to take preparadas, ready to usar, at least 15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">In addition to the photos y clothes works in combination with other prendas, all of which are different from those which are in use in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">Todo that needs to be taken into account when designing the outfit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and the style suponen themselves, in many cases, half of success.</seg>
<seg id="47">You only have to look at to Madonna, which is not exactly one singer extraordinary, but the image and márquetin have made it a world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not yet a clear tendencia to use the services of the estilistas.</seg>
<seg id="49">Until the characters famous también find them useless (enough my abilities, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Y when someone asks us nuestros servicios, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a talla very different to his real (lower).</seg>
<seg id="51">Only queda guglear y find out if the magazines of the heart ya have written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight / thinned, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">On Sunday, Honza y Mario we insisted that the hairdressers is not enough orientarse in fashion, but must understand outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">In her work, was primarily must communicate with people to the one dressed, so it is essential to be good un psicólogo.</seg>
<seg id="54">Sabe valorar people, not less, defends its opiniones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">« When a headmistress os para recruited him clasifiquéis the vestuario y que se the completéis in fine, you can 't throw - away todo what was, and say: “ Huy qué horror » ».</seg>
<seg id="56">« Encontrad at least a couple of things that podáis ponderar y que recomendar para someone may poner », says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Él also showed us that todo should be in the so - called “ placovka », that is to say, the stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is set around the waist and se tienen a necessary tools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Son objetos as tijeras, as tijeras, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. there is also a thread of nylon (which use the hairdressers during the session on photos of products such as handbags o que caps), pinzas special can clothing por ahead, if this were higher (the pins, y otro tipo of enganches are not allowed, which could damage the fabric), or a game of tailoring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Para not to stay in the listening pasiva y poner something into practice, we have learned to become the suela of shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in an area plana, it could damage the suela y much more abroad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Y we did more than revestir y revestir.</seg>
<seg id="63">We could not tocar shoes with scissors para not harm por accident.</seg>
<seg id="64">So we have to be very adept.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario has given me a joy to pay tribute to my work reservas sin.</seg>
<seg id="66">The truth is that it does not give me very well these skills.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a small part of everything we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.</seg>
<seg id="68">Ya I have realised that devote myself to the styling at a professional level is not a way of talking, but I see exactly like what people say.</seg>

<seg id="22">So, for example, in the desert os encontráis una tormenta of sand that reduced visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">Instead, in the mountains of the need to be careful that you sepulte una avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Según that, each of the racing is very well developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are a couple of solo models, but this is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a moment, trying to bring to a number of rivals required (normal in a race classic), after tratáis to gain time (classic duel timed) and then os expects a duel against a solo adversary.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the middle of all this is sometimes the police, which only complicate matters further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The novelty son the landscape outside of the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">Se presentan interactive animations when Jack, in the majority of cases, it has to escape from someone and vosotros tenéis que help, always pulsando button just at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Resulta sorprendente, however, that it has fewer paisajes in the game of what we would expect (in particular there is only tres).</seg>
<seg id="32">Pero the end result is a good thing, because this is not to be rude, y in the already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game resulte more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model of driving sigue the fingerprints of previous episodes.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that already today is not much, but you cannot claim to be a bad thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Si buscáis una simulación realista, already podéis look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">Pero to a career designed quite action suits him quite this driving style, but we can find something better between games of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, so good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Pero problems arise after a certain amount of time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the right of the models of driving, because the same is not true of the collisions.</seg>
<seg id="40">Games of this sort cannot expect recree deformations y collisions complicated, but in fact, before a coup against any objeto, you can 't predecir how reaccionará vuestro Auto, which means that not everything is in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is typical that, as a forward very tight or move the car with traffic normal, only has roces light, but in other situations, almost identical, your car has just doing piruetas got out of control.</seg>
<seg id="42">O even just totalmente destroyed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system of reseteo, are not big problems, but it can poneros in a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="44">The reseteos are programmed so that, when sufres un accident or te sales of the runway, the game te restituye the last point rescue on the runway.</seg>
<seg id="45">Sin embargo, in every race solo se has five reseteos available.</seg>
<seg id="46">The si consumís todas, you must reiniciar the race from the start.</seg>
<seg id="47">So it is no more than a help in the event that something does not go well, but it is not very unreliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, nor the reseteo aid, only learned the aid given the stage of memory.</seg>
<seg id="49">Una great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts repiten in different places.</seg>
<seg id="50">In some curves, for instance, you have to go in a unique way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Otras veces os encontráis somewhere vehículos « siempre civilians ” with the same configuration, even if you are the first, quintos o lleguéis five minutes before or after.</seg>
<seg id="52">This makes rabiar sobre todo in situations, when two legislation veis que van to a meeting in opposite directions, your opponent sin problemas ahead, but when you, you must be o well curb.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is like when lleguéis, because is scheduled por que “ shock » siempre sucederá in front of your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents also tienen ventaja more.</seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game llegaréis sites where, without taking into account the time, always os earlier the same opponent in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">In addition to this happens at the end of the game, in a long puente, which is even more shocking.</seg>
<seg id="57">Your oponente must come before vosotros, whatever the cost.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it goes ahead ”, makes the vision of cars vienen head - on, so that the principle podéis papilla make the car.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Se puede understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose - hanger, and adrenalin, but the execution is so apparent seguramente os down immediately.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a pity, because although the model of the journey sea simple, the game is fun and with action, so often it is not possible to continue to detail what happens and where.</seg>
<seg id="61">Y realmente gives equal if the credit has been the idea with 50 pistas exclusive or the classification in the career for is not quite the boredom, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Una unusual idea is to change the cars during the careers.</seg>
<seg id="63">Tenéis que be attentive to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because it tenéis que change self, although in the vast majority of cases os suffice it to you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Cars se divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports son suitable for zonas urbanas, cars strong Americans for motorways rectas y the exotic superdeportivos para una técnica driving by, for example, mountain roads with curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">In addition to narrative thread principal también there is a thread of challenges paralelo, that is to say, there are racing in specific places fruits ye shall know por stories.</seg>
<seg id="67">Conseguiréis here not only medals, but also of experience to vuestro perfil, which serves tanto para challenges as the tales.</seg>
<seg id="68">To achieve the higher level, the drivers are opening varias posibilidades, starting with the car y ending with funds to the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the same time, there are connected una Autolog role in line, which compares vuestros resultados with other players and disponibiliza otras functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Uno elements more difficult to understand is how it is made the last race in history.</seg>
<seg id="71">With the car arrived to the tunnel subway (pase), where os ponéis to run in the dark por channels (pase).</seg>
<seg id="72">The velocímetro os between 150 and 200 km / h (pase) and, suddenly, os comes the convoy of the metro and se os riding roughshod over sin.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the drafting seguramente tendremos una discussion on this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game to none pensó siquiera o un poco si authors we really toman por una of the panda.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical part of the game is not unusual, but at least the effects visuales general resultan in the majority of cases, savory, sometimes even soberbios.</seg>
<seg id="75">Pues qué pena que, in the most tense moments se reduce the quality of image and, at times, in a way that is serious.</seg>
<seg id="76">This particularly affects the accidents where there are many participants involved, when the picture quality continued ya is not valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The audio is good and the soundtracks is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In order to make it appeal to the bulk of the youth group, the soundtracks pertenece in the category “ each of his father and his mother ”, but can be suponer que no one will buy the game solo por su music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The feeling end of Need for Speed The Run: it is therefore pretty confusing.</seg>
<seg id="80">The game si avoid mistakes, we have absolutely tontos problemas in stating that the Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">You get the feeling that the game is not over.</seg>
<seg id="82">The fun is guaranteed, but preparaos porque os will attack the mistakes in the eye with the strength of a reflectores airport.</seg>

<seg id="1">Story: Brandt</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovative IBM enters its segundo siglo of existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Someone término que si seek a defines with great precision the strategy of IBM, the clearest sería « long term ”.</seg>
<seg id="4">Para the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is percibe as current and, however, it has now been 100 years since its founding.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this nature largoplacista put it the first head of the signing, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ya él coined the slogan that many problems in the world have solución si people is ready to think.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Su slogan “ think! ” is made in its sello, around which will be building the life of the future (giant was also the title of a magazine internal IBM began to publish in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">Watson was also the basis of a culture of company carefully lifted.</seg>
<seg id="9">« Para us, IBM pensamiento involves a long - term, a perpetual motion in the direction of the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived y prosperado for over 100 years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without temer changes around.</seg>
<seg id="11">This has allowed us to, during our primer siglo, transform technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We expect prosperar even more in our second siglo », said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Un sistema sofisticado</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, as in the 1930s - the care of their employees as the employer of Baťa in the Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were among the first operarios Americans who enjoyed paid leave, safe, uniform elegant and un sofisticado sistema remuneration premiaba the best inventors and vendedores.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same sofisticación long - term keeps the IBM in the relationship with the customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ya from the beginning the company supo discover talentos (as one of the first global firms in putting an end to any kind of discrimination, could choose without problemas).</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with the strategy of anti - discrimination is the current plan of IBM, Palmisano to replace it the forward woman: Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">She has been working treinta years at IBM, where it has been head of sales, márquetin y strategies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Over the last few years, IBM has played the so - called meetings virtuales, rain of ideas in line, from countless future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is no surprise that sobren ideas, because in the signature trabajan almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Una institution with a good reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The position in the business proporciona fixed to the company a strong image internal and external.</seg>
<seg id="23">« From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution more than company tecnológica » profesora economist, says the Harvard Business School y author of the book on IBM Rosabeth in Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">« IBM is not a company tecnológica, but a company that seeks to resolve problemas of business for usuarios of technology ” puntualiza George Colony of the consultancy Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or the “ Great verde » - as it is known in the US families because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the biggest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">The company is possibly tecnológica more versatile (develops tanto equipment such as infrastructure and services accommodation web within a wide range of services, ranging from servidores until nanotechnology).</seg>
<seg id="28">Ostenta the largest number of patents all the technology companies in the United States and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among its inventions se found the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, the bar codes; the diskettes.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM facturará this year 220 billion dollars. this year has become the second signing tecnológica por market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when superó por primera vez in 1996 to Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking to the future</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the taste of the clients and the time (IBM not opted for su propio sistema operativo, OS / 2, services online Prodigy u ordenadores IBM PCjr).</seg>
<seg id="33">« Si su business based in advance, can 't emotionally anchor in the past ”, acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Por that IBM has no problems on building up its bases in other plataformas (and equally, if not working, left).</seg>
<seg id="35">Y there is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which are basically maintains and falls siempre exclusively with Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Tecnología future</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In a matter of sales, IBM se devotes sobre todo services, of which approximately one fifth son of programmes and otra quinta equipment.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, even in 1990 teams representaban more than half of the share of suppliers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In the year 2000, IBM has sold assets of underperformance por un valor total of $15 billion over the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology of the future.</seg>
<seg id="40">The investments have followed since 2008, when we first said the modern global financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM acts according to the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis of the 29 increased investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">Parece que until now the company IBM has been able to weather the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 estratosféricamente has grown to a 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The currency of IBM is changing all, save its valor.</seg>
<seg id="45">Se puede, therefore, expect that when I come to the next crisis, this giant flexible aguantará.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM 's history: from the cortadora cheese until space flight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The name IBM ya se takes in the year 1924 - originalmente se trataba utilizada of a mark in the branches of Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The base that resulted in the birth of IBM surge of the merger of four companies that are remontan at the 1880 's.</seg>
<seg id="50">Poseía inventions as the famous “ reloj of file », which allows control the entry and exit of employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 también presidió su supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint fichó at the head of a company in the competition, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson siguen siendo firm on the basis that sustentan corporate culture and identity).</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson asked the company until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its title suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices business, from cortadores meat and queso until tills.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years ago that Watson ran the company, turnover is doubled in 9 million dollars and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so crucial to the company, tras almost 40 years of elected chair of the Head, was replaced by su son, Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM started work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language programming.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s, the staff and the computers of IBM helped NASA to guide the flights to space (Mercurio, Saturn y in 1969 the famous vuelo to the moon).</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System / 360.</seg>
<seg id="61">The classic « pecés », which installed the standard computers from that time, came to market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Veinte years later, IBM vendió su producción computers in the chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the part of consultancy company Pricewaterhouse Coopers y began to offer a comprehensive advice and servicios high value - added.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy has paid IBM these past three years is the concept Smarter Planet, which is to say, “ a planeta smarter ”.</seg>
<seg id="64">Su objetivo is more rational use of the technology is not yet have planned the areas and has improved the circumstances, for example, in the transportation and the administration of cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Para trade sector, IBM presentó not long ago the platform « Smart commerce » que permite retailers manage the business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM tiene una long history in this country.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How have evolved the price of travel since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 had in Czechoslovakia, only five state licensed travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea y Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies of the time vendían in the majority of cases viajes solo at the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (Democratic Republic German), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Una positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when we could viajar to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime se tipped to the west and the journeys of czech tourists were then quite restringidos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Una great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i also Checoeslovacos) is not enable them to viajar free and individually, even by the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">Si un citizen quería viajar individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, it needed a letter of invitation, if not, the journey individual was not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The travel agencies ofrecían in those days también viajes to the west, but one should the tail with a sack of sleep and pasar all night - or we hold « good » known in the agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">Still, not everything was won.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so - called “ promesa of change ” que was the prerequisite for travel to the West, not been attached to the “ people políticamente poco reliable ”, which will not be able to travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The currency checoslovaca was not a currency freely convertible y, without a guarantee of change, was possible at the resources (the currency occidental viajar) for the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The vast majority of the Czechs pasaban sus vacaciones in their own country, which is why there was a large number of huts and summer houses, which the Czechs. on this habit todavía persiste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The way to travel in the Czechs has suffered from the real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Until 1989 to us was not going more pasar holidays in the GDR o Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million trips on holiday to countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Resulta nna great paradox, which now are not aware of the fact that the current favourite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not be viajar freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of the 1990s imposed visa - free travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which brought a huge oleada visits short - term, particularly at Vienna or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The checoeslovacos, for a long time, has not seen enough of the trips to the west, the whole world wanted to verlo what at least for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="18">Por example, sleeping in Paris the Czechs in parks in tents, as our income then not afforded us pagar un hotel or pensión.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Una characteristic of the Czechs of that time was the take with them (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Otro important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the czech koruna, part of our turistas podían finally, after decades, freely buy currency occidental.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living rising y through average wages, which around 1997 provocó un increase in demand for travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With the increasing demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 regularly, to prepare the travel usando connections charter, which made incredibly lower prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts por the volume of passengers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the 90 of the last century, because the Czechs viajaban sin visado in almost every developed country, except in the US, which simplificó even more nuestros viajes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Otro interesting moment in the history of tourism pos - revolutionary sucedió ya in 2000, when it was organised, thanks to a huge demand, the first plane direct from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and it was to Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since that year, todos years vuelos direct charter with turistas Czechs made países distant and hot. this winter ya se volará directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">The countries exotic visit currently some 100,000 czech per year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Otro interesting moment of this era, which symbolises nuestro development pos - revolutionary, came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On November 17, 2008, US removed visas for tourists Czechs, with what our país pasó to be among the world 's most developed countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in its history, it has been more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and by primera vez in its history, have been spent on foreign travel more than $15 CZK por heads, including the costs in the place of residence.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">General Assembly convened ordinaria para elect the President, which could end up again at a standstill.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For almost five months football czech is without presidente y is likely to be the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR), is not known, nor tras the convening of the next General Assembly extraordinary tendrá this Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, it has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.</seg>
<seg id="4">The same sin, there can be no votar siquiera para choose between the three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Interested parties to chair the football czech son Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta y Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hašek renunció to his office in June but not before calling his colleagues with the aim of finding a persona strong supiese ocuparse of football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sin embargo, after the end of era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations Association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was made clear the September 16, when it had to ser elected the new President.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of the House General reunieron in vain to the house National Národní dům (), located in the district of praguense Smíchov, because the talks had blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">No consensus was reached or who is in the General Assembly, tenía right to vote — only representatives or legal también delegates with full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">From that moment, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, backed también por the recommendation of the Institute of State and right, according to which the representation por plenos poderes is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sin embargo, disputes over the electoral code siguen open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">More light on the situation could not shed nor the Executive Committee, in its meetings, ordinary o extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.</seg>
<seg id="14">The view on the possibility of voting has changed a par times ya, but the worst point sigue siendo.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: what is the easy in the third round para avoid deadlock?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The dispute revolves « about whether to proceed in line with the statutes or find another model, ” says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice - presidents of the FAČR, which, in the direction of the partnership, represents the football profesional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Según the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate who tenga higher percentage of support in the federation, to which it will present su candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="18">The region of Moravia is ready to go to a commitment to pueda win the candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both total federations.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Bohemia, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations porcentuales, should have the majority of at least two - thirds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">« This quitaría, however, the sense of the two rounds before and deny por complete the concept of system bicameral », as well as Svoboda understands the objections of the morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and votar según applicable statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With that, surprisingly, is also agree Tomaš Paclík, though supposedly the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all the candidates should be more Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">I would like to see « votara to agree with the statutes ”.</seg>
<seg id="23">« Para que did not invent any tontería about representatives as in the last General Assembly », says the owner of Victoria Plzen, postula por primera vez as candidate for accession conducts its observaciones principalmente against Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta sigue siendo optimista.</seg>
<seg id="25">Según él, in Nymburk se will decide on the new president and él believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate in a constructive manner.</seg>
<seg id="26">« Todas passions are apaciguarán with the Party of today of our national team in the European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">« Football volverá to be protagonista, and cooperate more comfortable » says the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates tiene more experience in management of football, both at a professional level and regional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is the more restrained.</seg>
<seg id="29">I hope that « se to come to an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated. ”</seg>
<seg id="30">« We are talking about the conflict between bohemios y Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to its own convenience. ”</seg>
<seg id="31">« This may have resulted in a nuevo blockade of the General Assembly. ”</seg>
<seg id="32">« Anyway, I hope that it will impose the common ”, said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Ya is not a very long time for todas the parties reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations were que realizarse in Montenegro, but who puede saber until it begins the party si the football team will be entirely?</seg>
<seg id="35">The special plane, in which tuvieron que viajar to Podgorica, among other vice presidents Dalibor Kucera y Rajchl, has not come up this morning by problemas técnicos in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transportar to part of the executive committee at the place where tendrá place the party of classification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Quizas the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one to be held at the ministerial level, which, according to count, will be held this Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">To Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to incorporate the parties divided the organisation sporting more powerful of the country to se to reach agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of the football and también the next general assembly of the Central Committee of the Federation of the sport (checoslovaca ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to sport czech tras the financial problems of the home of Sazka lotteries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík fight for achieving the presidency because it does not find a most suitable candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Si the head of footballers in Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly extraordinary knew the name of a candidate right that satisficiese todas sus ideas on the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or presentaría as a candidate to a tan relevante.</seg>
<seg id="41">« Si a persona, would be fighting for it and not introduce me as a candidate for the elections. ”</seg>
<seg id="42">Pero « until now we have not been able to find a persona, ” said Paclík para the Czech News Agency (ČTK)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta y Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block Pelta, the winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR).</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík puntualiza que también, in case vencer evidently remain in the office of President solo until 2013, when they reach the turn of the Ordinary Assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In that post, I would like to see an expert and a good manager que is not too closely related to the football events.</seg>
<seg id="46">« Have already spoken to some people that I could tener into consideration. ”</seg>
<seg id="47">« Para me was foolish oír some say that at this time, not even want to identify with the czech football. ”</seg>
<seg id="48">« I would like to change that view », it adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What was supposed to be more embarrassing Paclík at this moment is the relationship of Pelta with the chairman of the Football Association Regional Pilsen Berbr Roman, a man with a past controversial, known outside the mundillo as a powerful lobista with ability to influence the vote of the delegates at the General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="50">Para Paclík is just not acceptable to Pelta sentado in the chair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">« If it wins, it would maintain the status vigente y nothing in football unchanged ”.</seg>
<seg id="52">« With the support of Berbra, a business person ambitious, the football sacará even less » Paclík, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Also mentioned the fact that a few years ago, the name of Pelta was associated with a telefónica listens during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta salió go unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">I do not know what « prestigio football podría traer victory of Pelta. ”</seg>
<seg id="55">« Y ojos with what we will look at UEFA and FIFA », said Paclík, which also toma with some caution su statement previous « vendería Club Pilsen si se » Pelta becomes president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the case of winning elections Thursday, Paclík podría plantearse cooperation with Pelta in the future.</seg>
<seg id="57">In this opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that terminó in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">« Él (Pelta) would be the first that seguiría ».</seg>
<seg id="59">« Is quite capable. ”</seg>
<seg id="60">« I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation ».</seg>
<seg id="61">Pero « not as manager of a partnership ”.</seg>
<seg id="62">« Nor do I go the nose where I do not feel able » Paclík added, which in September, suscitó much attention to support the suspension of the Commission referees presidida por Ludek Macel, taken over by Dagmar Damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík admits that it was willing to manage the partnership.</seg>
<seg id="64">Recurre to their management capabilities of private companies, since last summer, is also the director of the Pilsen, which with its support in May the triumph in the first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">« My strength to change a few things in the area of football and contribute to its practice segura. ”</seg>
<seg id="66">« Para reducir the influence of some pressure groups, which will probably tienden to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal, producing situaciones unpleasant, said Paclík sin hide their dislike of the President of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The priorities also sería una of the consolidation of the relationship between the FAČR y the Olympic Committee of the Czech, with the help of which pressure on political leaders to set aside more money to the sport of taxes in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="68">« Is one of the key problems that should dedicate the new President. ”</seg>
<seg id="69">« Si increase taxes on gambling, as advertised, political parties, to support their arguments, but, frankly, they need to tell us where it ends up todo this money ”, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">In addition, Paclík now does not even take account of su partnership with the Club Pilsner, even though he also says that the President of the FAČR must be “ non - partisan ”.</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is associated with Jablonec y Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">« Is not ideal. ”</seg>
<seg id="73">I do not see « pero sentido to give hypocritically my actions of the club of Pilsen to another person para then go there after un year and East ”, said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta prometió FAČR nuevos statutes to end the stalemate in the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association uno of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, he promised that, if elected, would ensure that the FAČR tuviera unos nuevos statutes that sirvieran definitely a reason for solucionar, in the future, the controversies on the regulation of elections.</seg>
<seg id="76">The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the conflict preelectoral podría move towards a solution today with the possible victoria 's football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Ya before the elections not made in September, Pelta prometió focus, if elected, precisely in the representation and to raise funds.</seg>
<seg id="78">Decided to take part in the last minute at the last general assembly, which is why this delay of two months I could go either to defend and presentar, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">« People from all levels of football ocupa ya long ago and expected to know this Thursday, the new President. ”</seg>
<seg id="80">« Sienten que the time has come for someone to manage the partnership ”, thinks the man who principalmente associated with the club, but which Jablonice trabajó in Sparta y in the executive committee of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id="81">This is why, having por suficiente experience to manage the football Czech.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reinaba in the days of Ivan Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">« Sadly, in the General Assembly in June were approved the statutes were not as perfectos as all pensaban. ”</seg>
<seg id="84">Si « we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president ya since September » Pelta, warned.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The architecture of postgerra modern forms of passionate, clear, the halls of glass, curves valientes y new construction materials, which are typical of thinking on the technical progress, for which, the flag of the architect austrian Karl Schwanzer para the exhibition in Brussels is an example of 1958 right and known.</seg>
<seg id="7">The flag of Schwanzer obtuvo then the Grand Prix of architecture largely on su lightly and floating construction steel - and - glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction is considered to have a milestone of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Did the architect tan también known that built the flag of Austria in this exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="10">With its legendary torre four cylinders para MBW more building adjacent aplanado in Munich, became internationally known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Su pabellón, designed as a construction temporal para exhibitions se lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten along to the station in the south of Vienna, reformó in 1962 and within se opened un Museum of the 20th century, is called the “ home 20 ”.</seg>
<seg id="12">The building was adequate pero lacked the space and tecnología correspond to an museum; without any pared para hang art, not a good atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite this utilizó until the contemporary art in Vienna un nuevo home.</seg>
<seg id="14">The building is empty since 2001 and lapses increasingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformó the flag, now called it “ home 21 ” y se usará in the future as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Tuesday afternoon there opened the museum belvedere, to which it belongs to the home, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Agnes Husslein - arc, the new head of the gallery belvedere austrian since 2007, reached a nuevo start.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein - Arco, Doctor in history of art with a considerable career, among other things, patinadora artistic sobre ice in his youth, later in carries Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum Director y founder of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectores monuments, provided public funds and patrocinadores privados y established its uso.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the exception of contemporary art makes the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba Foundation 's Lisbon, there should be a cafeteria y una bookshop y also build a office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict, budget under control</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Krischanitz was the best choice for doing so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because reformó of sensitive way the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, broader and won the competition, if not because studied with Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him un « important place huge and », in which included « almost all the weekend » exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the project and the problem of the building, which vanished with his traslado to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and easily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was “ a devorador of energy ”, said Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">Se changed the profile of the windows of the façade of glass, installed a glass with reforzado insulating glass fibre y se remplazó the glass ceiling por un safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Bridges térmicos y the beams of steel reforzaron o remplazaron y the roofs of asbestos are rehabilitaron.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two sótanos se used to the new uso, a panel of light declined between the house and the street proporciona lighting, a bridge sirve para enter the building almost nuevo, but still the flag of Schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">The doors permanecen external originales, the house is in pintada tonos old species of true mahogany y protegida against oxidación.</seg>
<seg id="29">Y the cinema is exactly as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">Y todo this with a strict control of the office of monuments and un low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">« Often tenía que find material that is good, cheap and también preferred to the office of protection of monuments », says Krischanitz y warns of a suelo áspero in the basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, problems and reformas, the building was still more flexible and lighter.</seg>
<seg id="33">The flag « que vino of Brussels ” has been difficult, said recently, a Krischanitz típica « appearance by chance in the history of the town. ”</seg>
<seg id="34">Una architecture as well as being “ siempre in all the wrong ” y por « why I want to raise awareness appropriate ”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, the house is not 21 in the wrong place, has happened un stroke of luck urbanístico. the utterly nuevo y planeado « district of the station central ”, with viviendas y oficinas, sits alongside the Garten Schweizer.</seg>
<seg id="36">Y tal vez suceda otro stroke of luck: the house 21 podría recibir un refuerzo of another building Krischanitz, because the collecting Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of art temporal berlin y, as oye, negotiate with the city sobre un place vecino in Garten Schweizer.</seg>

<seg id="1">The bank scandal of Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The bank more risky in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis, and since then it slid from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now runs a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Seguro que Axel Weber not had thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his spectacular partida of the summit of the federal bank, in July was known que in 2013 would start in a new, almost equally spectacular trabajo: chairman of the Council 's administrative big swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative paso in his career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber happy públicamente, praises Switzerland for su beauty and to the UBS por su recién acquired solidez y slipped observaciones friendly noises about sus future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">The USB « has achieved a revitalización ».</seg>
<seg id="9">« I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger y Oswald Grübel ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In September quedó clear that all sería totalmente different.</seg>
<seg id="11">Un operador financial USB in London avoided todos security systems of the bank and he let down 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Oswald Grübel, director - general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The President of the Council 's administrative USB se considered since then also tocado, and all preguntaron: when is Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Que se known Weber will advise the bank since February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">Y se take over the presidency of the Council administration in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This is hard to Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counsel and has had a periodo adaptation seguramente necessary.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of blow was in charge of the strategy of a bank, who has just returned to test que deserves the title “ the largest bank in the scandal of Europe ” for some time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Por una parte, USB is enormous, until recently, was the largest manager of global goods, and, on the other hand, for years, slides a scandal to the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, so we think, it saves the past tan orgulloso swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The beginning of the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">The USB tuvo una fame excellent until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the administrator of goods suizo discreet and sólido, but also cunning, combined with ambitious targets, I also wanted to ser un large numbers in investment banks.</seg>
<seg id="24">Por una parte, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from clients wealthy que any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">Y por otra parte moved as investment bank in the league of big banks in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This impressive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hans Geiger, the former banker y posterior profesor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: “ First my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank. ”</seg>
<seg id="28">« From today 's point of view, one wonders: how could be wrong? ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It was a big mistake.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the year 2007 salió to light that something went very wrong in the USB.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director - General, which until then it was regarded as a banker - very intelligent, resigned sorprendentemente.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, it sospechó right.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Fund 's investment bank embarked in losses with titles of high - risk and tuvo que repay billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">Para saddled with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">This para found investors, of course, that some look with contempt until shortly before: a state - owned fund Asia and opaco of Singapore, and a state - owned fund árabe, so discreet, who never had heard su name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank tuvo que declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, President of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second highest - paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, he continued the catastrophe, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS se found in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and tuvo rescatada por que ser the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">The national bank bought valores problemáticos to UBS por many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave seis billions of francs per un obligatoriamente convertible bond, it is becoming copropietaria of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Toda Switzerland was affected, it said, it was this for un país pequeño, if taking in large banks tan.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007, it was more than five times higher than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).</seg>
<seg id="43">« We cannot go back to rescue the UBS », said Geiger, an expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first unió disaster is the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">Pocos months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and se showed willing to hand over data of well - heeled customers, which may have disappointed taxes, with the help of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, adopted a number of 780 billions of dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from this business with a compensation for pago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">With that, the UBS confessed to more or less have helped in the tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="48">Something that had been simultáneamente perdió su always capital in the competition for customers ricos: the glow of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">Tras the scandal, the secret of the swiss bank ya is not the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">This was followed by the resignation of President of the Management Board and the President of the European Council.</seg>
<seg id="51">Y the exodus of the funds of clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">In this way, in a few months, the bank perdió su credibility in their two sectors: plants in investment banking by the erroneous and speculation in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Y fair when they come back to be a little calmer, just when people thought the UBS que volvía to achieve this, it is happening this unhappy history of the operator, a trader individual defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank will realise that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">Y se unveiled, apparently, this is still not working well with the management of risk in investment banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">With the case « Adoboli se says that controls risk have changed too little ”, says Martin thank, a professor of economics and finance at the Corporation Institute at the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial director of a large bank german also is sure: “ the problem of the UBS is that it dominates the controls. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Por what emerged the idea of caution, with which the bankers suizos se presentaban for some time, be the guardians of the world 's greatest assets: no risk too great, security, on the other hand, the money quiere quebrar on the other side of the Republic Alpine.</seg>
<seg id="58">Deposits for the safety of swiss banks were the symbol of the reliability and unflinching, y Sprüngli Lindt chocolate genuine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The heart of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of strong private bank suizo, only is a bit higher.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has su sede principal in the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which runs from the main season directly to the Lake Zurich, embodied by the summits of snow covered in the swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">Here the buildings are ostentosos, rents son unos the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">These include jewellery as Tiffany 's in business tradicionales suizos as the confectionery Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">Residen here for years, the swiss banks: from the national bank, via the palace of Credit Suisse, until the elitarios private banks as Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Se comes into the room of receipt of the UBS through a revolving pesada puerta.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside, the walls are revestidas of marble, in large sillones leather, along with the logo of the bank is a great sign para indicate “ security. ”</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS sabe what the customer is looking for here: security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The two big swiss banks, Credit Suisse, UBS y at some point have shifted the idea of big swiss bank, or have betrayed, like the president of a small private bank suizo.</seg>
<seg id="69">Prefiere not read his name in the paper, after all, like all bankers suizos too, with the business of both big banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS se has become too big, believes, mostly in investment banking, where the Anglo - saxons have gained ground.</seg>
<seg id="71">There the Swiss had nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">« Y se used for a long time in the customs of the Anglo - saxons. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">In fact, the UBS investment banking changed the Anglo - Saxon, tabled his primera large gain and then came the disaster, no entity european financial tanto had lost money in the jungle of the high risk as the big swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="75">« Wednesday that the coalition government of the tiny country of seven million decided to rescue the largest exercise in the history of their nation, ” writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book “ Der Crash - UBS » (“ the crash of the UBS » in Spanish).</seg>
<seg id="76">Politicians granted to 68 billion francs and thousands of approximately 45 billion to save the large bank of bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">¿You do?</seg>
<seg id="78">Se talks with bankers suizos, that 's how the problem in the dimension of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three big swiss banks are blending a powerful consortium.</seg>
<seg id="80">Surge un bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">What sirvió para por que the two different banks precursores of UBS se but: a bank rico pero sleeping with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and una internationalisation poorest pero stronger.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the investment banks internacionalizados arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could make rodar una great bicycle financial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">There are two names relacionados with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the Association of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then the president of the administrative board.</seg>
<seg id="84">« Siempre pensé Wuffli y que Ospel were a team » perfecto, says the banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">« Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, which meant a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive que got up from the learning in the bank until the summit. ”</seg>
<seg id="86">Finally, Ospel se Wuffli trusted what they told them.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the end, y Wuffli committed probablemente un fatal error: “ Pensó que sus models were a realidad » Geiger, says.</seg>
<seg id="88">« Is a tragic one. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Trágico, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: the attempt came before the case.</seg>
<seg id="91">The employees of the UBS se remember clearly meetings managers, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repetía the same slogan: lower the throne to Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The bank was the american investment bank, the world 's most powerful.</seg>
<seg id="93">Leading the “ League Tables », the rankings which then documentaban the success of the banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">The UBS quería be at the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some of the steps he salieron well.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the operations of currency and in the negotiation of action was at the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">Sin embargo, advisers companies responsible pusieron highlighted a punto weak: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking « fixed income ” compensation, there is a huge amount to the big banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS tiene vacíos mortgage products in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">Para fill the gaps, the UBS started a venture that he was almost cost existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Ávidos growth, invested tanto the same bank as one of its high - risk funds created american investment in high - risk.</seg>
<seg id="101">Se transformó into a machine poderosa para titularizar mortgage loans and american venderlos then, keeping certain risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Y también, as other banks sought the fall for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="103">« In the summer of 2007, as the american housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there ”, said Geiger, an expert in banking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">Large tan the euphoria, so profunda the fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">Un manager tuvo que go, since the attempt to regulate resultó more complicated than expected.</seg>
<seg id="106">The UBS se became seats proyectables y insecure son until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Currently, who runs a large bank, has a trabajo almost impossible.</seg>
<seg id="108">Must find a strategy for a bank, in which all the business models are logical perdidos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Geiger, an expert on banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, to focus on the administration of goods, return to the roots suizas.</seg>
<seg id="110">The bank does not want to go so far (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">Pero investment banking must reduce much, it is clear now.</seg>
<seg id="112">The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.</seg>
<seg id="113">In reality, they only pensó in the italian - swiss of 51 years as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank separó sorprendentemente of his predecessor Grübel.</seg>
<seg id="114">In the meantime, he imposed: it should pass permanently business from UBS, told the bank in Zurich on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti quiere back to the investment bank to their state in the mid - 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">Suprime 500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">Pero this is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">¿Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">¿With what quiere make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that seguro se does Axel Weber today.</seg>
<seg id="122">So far, only going to say it will be looking for a vivienda with his wife in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">On a personal level massacre</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The intense and generous nuevo book by Peter Englund, the beauty and the pain of the battle (the Beauty and the Sorrow íntima): a history of the First World War, “ begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that could make one might fall into the soul.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Here are some advice: start suavemente this page y su páginas make it a brand.</seg>
<seg id="4">It will be very familiar with these people in the narrative novelística of Mr Englund, and this dramatis personae work as their GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of its men and women, is confusing and vulnerable in the fog of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Mr Englund is a historian and periodista sueco.</seg>
<seg id="6">También is the new secretario permanente of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has written here is a book poco, which rightly describes as “ a trabajo anti - history. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains a few notable names are important or famous battles; practically no ambassadors, elegant periodistas o discussions on tácticas o material.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is not so much a book about what ocurrió explains, as “ a book about how it happened » concerning about “ sentimientos, impressions and experiences, and states of humor. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">« The beauty and the pain of the battle « combines experience in times of war more or less 20 men and women ordinarias, on both sides of the war, from colegialas y botánicos to escaladores, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people will become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some were turned into prisoners of war, otherwise they will lose sus members will be crazy o die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sus vidas parpadean here as velas votivas lit in a church; nuevos se added to the mix and others apagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book by Mr Englund is a deviation from the history books standard.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is also a corrective to the notion that the first war world has scarcely was the disastrous trench warfare on the western front.</seg>
<seg id="16">« The beauty and the pain of the battle ” se moves of expertly through other teatros of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern, Mesopotamia, Africa 's east.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives; one pasa Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tse - tse son un problema intractable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Éste Paper is a touching, almost from the start.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina que reeks of cordita.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the fire artillery se oye in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, te quedas o huyes?</seg>
<seg id="21">Of all forms ¿quién viene?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one understands what is happening, even by qué tiene que se fight this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">« Lack of facts ”, notes Mr Englund, “ has rellenado with conjectures, guesses, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of the conspiracy, dreams, pesadillas y rumores ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">« The beauty and the pain of the battle ” sigue individuals as Florence Farmborough, an english nurse in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor german fleet of the high seas.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sus se stories have been largely of memoirs, letters and otro material already publicado earlier.</seg>
<seg id="26">The explanations of their lives pueden ser terrifying o moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, details perdidos, Mr Englund.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them are about hardship and make do with what we have.</seg>
<seg id="28">About telling the story of a schoolgirl german says: “ Sucedáneos everywhere sucedáneos ».</seg>
<seg id="29">« Sucedáneo coffee, aluminium false, rubber imitation, vendas paper, buttons of wood. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Still talking about food sucedánea in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">Described as “ meat made from rice broth y prensado in fat carnero rematado (and with a bone false made of wood); tabaco fact roots and peladuras potatoes secas; zapatos sole » wood.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is, notes, “ 837 sustitutos permitidos meat in the production of sausages, 511 sustitutos coffee registrados ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are about the honour and value.</seg>
<seg id="34">Un american reconoce su propio momentum towards the savagery y says about the war: “ Sientes que, after all, this is what the men are conceived and not for sentarse in armchairs with a cigarette un y whisky, the newspaper of the evening or un bestseller, and to claim that this veneer significa civilisation and that there is not a barbaric behind this pechera almidonada y tachonada. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In return a soldado british realise that probably will die, and that no one will notice o will take care of.</seg>
<seg id="36">« Una vez que se uno resigna thinking sacrificed, one would like to think that podría ocurrir before the public ”, he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">On the other hand, is horribly parecido « a condemned man siendo strangled in secret ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Otras observaciones son about an old Europe disappearing, and on new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">« The conflict has increasingly become a competition economics, ” writes Mr Englund, “ a war between factories ».</seg>
<seg id="40">Refleja the arrival of what he called a “ nueva species in the bestiario 's new: the mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with ropas good clothing que implements its carnage while sitting behind a desk ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to get a disease venérea prostitutes as a way of avoiding the service in the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">The more grotesque « expression of this can be seen in the trade of pus gonocócico, that the soldiers are buying and embadurnan with their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital », writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who are really desperate « we looking sobre sus ojos, which often leads to blindness for life. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the Swede Peter made by Gates, the prose of Mr Englund ágil pero not extravagant, is perfectly suited to her work as a human being.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes refleja the way in which the war unleashed forces to “ exceptionally uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, revolution social, hatred religioso ».</seg>
<seg id="47">People start ask why sus leaders are doing to combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, as the Great War and the memory of a modern Paul Fussell, or novelas as novedad in the face of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of comprehensive histories.</seg>
<seg id="49">The volume of Mr Englund se une panteón poco a conventional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Su book has uno end of the most devastating puedo recordar in a non - fiction.</seg>
<seg id="51">Not revelaré.</seg>
<seg id="52">Pero is as if it had come from his book, torn between tus fingers of this page dramatis personae, and had quemado with a match.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Pero on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rechazó una measure that would have recortado funds for american operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">That left the mission of the US in a kind of legislative purgatorio - with Congress enough irritating to criticise the approach of Obama 's mission, but not as angry as to actually segar grass beneath their feet.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="14">The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Presentada in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.

<seg id="16">Burke says he is going for the top brass of the military, because the problem starts with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">« The army is a structure from the top to the bottom up ”, he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">« ¿Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? high command. ”</seg>

<p>

<seg id="20">Su strategy: instead of piling up to all the plaintiffs in this case, putting todos eggs in one basket, so to speak, is going to present varios cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure up.</seg>

<seg id="34">Su group tabled a demand in December against the administration of veterans, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way it handled the complaints of benefits to the people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.</seg>

<seg id="1">The walls tienen ojos: how researchers are studying te on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another tipo aireaba que sus puntos sight of anti - immigration in line.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who admitted having conducted a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, we faced its first public judicial hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Breivik puede have acted alone, was far from being solo in cyberspace: he spent most of the time that precedió his attack in front of their computers, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support groups right on social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers querían saber more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pero, how do you find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy - only tienes que go on Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">« We realised that it was not too hard to get them ”, says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report sobre populism digital european studies centre british DEMOS.</seg>
<seg id="9">The alijo of personal information, Facebook is so enciclopédico, says Bartlett, which the researchers simplemente utilizar the tool publicity for determining their desired demographic characteristics with precision scientific - the way that sellers have been using for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team of Bartlett found half a million fan of right - wing groups across Europe, and then I flew announcements, but instead of vincularles to a new band o producto diet, the announcements urging users to complete a survey that preguntaba sobre su educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about su propio future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To get through Facebook, Bartlett y sus colleagues were able to study to more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 countries in Europe — all without salir of the office.</seg>
<seg id="12">« Is a whole new way of making a research ”, says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not entirely sorprendentes: the supporters in line, right - wing groups tienden to be young men and angry about immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sin embargo, in a sort of turn, “ those who combine their activism in line with the activism outside line are more reasonable, more democratic, and less fierce que those quedan behind the computer screen ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook se is turning into a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the place to study everything, from health problems of trends sociales tal expressed in the “ I like to ”, messages on the walls and updates of state.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users, adding un promedio three piezas content per day, the “ supernova of data ” Facebook is creating a boom in the research, boosting the number of jobs that academics with the name of the site in the title until almost 800% in the last five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Para some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that te permite study to people who could not acercarte with a file on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">« Before, when intentabas encuestar people with the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify. ”</seg>
<seg id="20">« Tendrías que go through of the party, and they would never te permitirían the access ”, says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">« Facebook removes todo - vas to them directly. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Otros say that the site podría proporcionar una way to identify and address the health problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Un recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and sus colleagues, found that the university students who spoke of their exploits of binge on Facebook tenían un riesgo significativamente more have with the drink that students who permanecieron silent on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno sugiere que colleagues of the students, such as advisers residenciales, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who publique too many updates of State with his drinking.</seg>
<seg id="25">« Can 't tratar un problema si no puedes diagnose », said Dimitri Christakis, the co - author of Moreno y director of the health center, behavior and development of the child in the Seattle Children' s Research Institute, told the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">« We have found a way to identify children at risk que would otherwise not be diagnosed. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook también is constantly « pinchando » its own population para obtener data.</seg>
<seg id="28">The team of data of the site has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine 's Day, the expectation of turnout to half of the legislative period of 2010, and a índice of National Happiness (mainly utilizando information accessible - supporters of the digital freedom for a long time sostienen que the site should make available to other su large amount of data for research).</seg>
<seg id="29">Sin embargo, users of Facebook saben que the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - slaughtering for poder playing Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the site tu mine personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Pero ¿qué pasa when users of Facebook pasan to form part of a survey that do not even know?</seg>
<seg id="31">While the researchers have well defined guidelines on how recoger sus data out of line, online is a sweeping free - for - all.</seg>
<seg id="32">« Do not believe that many of the users have thought siquiera in the fact that an investigator podría be examining its perfiles », says Neil Selwyn, a sociólogo lab 's knowledge of London, on a study of 2006, which carried out with the walls of Facebook públicos students.</seg>
<seg id="33">« As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research this siendo completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know que parte information of the profile of a usuario y of the messages of the wall are verdad.</seg>
<seg id="37">« What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook son two completely different things, Selwyn » says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles un y pen siguen siendo the best tools for research that no one can utilizar.</seg>
<seg id="39">« No substitute for entering into the real world and speak with the real people ”, he says.</seg>

<seg id="9">This material archive, slightly reeditado, is the basis of Steve Jobs: the interview perdida, 68 minutes, which arrives in cinemas Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Para someone known for odiar the in - depth interviews, Jobs sorprendentemente here, it seems willing to give their philosophies tecnológicas y business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Y very pensativo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Four different throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of observations, where Jobs is considering clearly pensamientos, seeking precisión.</seg>
<seg id="13">También there are moments in which too perfectionist of Jobs sale to the surface, where it appears anxious because of the questions of Cringely, empujándole to go faster toward issues o arguments of greater importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before the age of Pixar, the ipod or the iphone, there is something oddly profético perdida in the interview, when Jobs assesses what it sees que otras companies make good and evil, and offers su propia visión the future of computing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Una thing is to read póstumas assessments of the career of Jobs, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs who vemos here, the soñador eager to the brink of greatness.</seg>
<seg id="16">Él tiene una visión of as you can y must be things.</seg>
<seg id="17">Not long after, to explain everything in detail here, was, and it did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Un rápido resumen seven secuencias notable: the interview perdida</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Sobre learned how to wear a business:</seg>
<seg id="20">« Over the years in the business, I always preguntaba: “ ¿por qué things you do? ” and the answers that te give way unchanged son: “ oh, that this is just the way it made ”.</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows por qué does what it does, in the business, no one thinks of things very deeply.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs leads to detail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bemused by the way is registraban costs - often starting with a “ standard ” cost que se did on rough estimates, and which was then covered with a “ variable » - developed a factory automated than claimed that podrían determine the costs of trade to detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Sobre the joke of the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs tells the “ blue box ” que él same built with Steve Wozniak, a device that permitía people hackear effectively and telephone company making calls to long - distance away.</seg>
<seg id="27">Se has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious.</seg>
<seg id="28">Describes how él y Wozniak probaron box through the use of a phone público, making a so - called, and then conectándose from a red of AT &amp;amp; T to another, while establishing a loop with the largest number of satellites posible.</seg>
<seg id="29">« We wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and gritabas through the phone público y volvía un - minute later on the telephone público - door side ”, says Jobs with a risita.</seg>
<seg id="30">« Éramos young people and what we learnt was that podíamos build something ourselves that podría control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world. ”</seg>
<seg id="31">Two, we did not know much, but podíamos build a small thing that podía control a giant thing - it was a lesson incredible, and I do not think that had ever been Apple sin.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs still describing glorious él y que una joke Wozniak almost abandoned, knocking the Vatican through the blue box in the middle of the night and solicitando talk with the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">As varios members of the catholic hierarchy were named in the middle of the night to speak with the american diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened para go to answer the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Sobre fall in love with the technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years, the hunting of spare parts to build a meter of frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett on the telephone directory y I made a call.</seg>
<seg id="36">Poco after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs had a summer job in part - time work in Hewlett - Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">« That was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that he had seen that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well trataban their employees. ”</seg>
<seg id="38">Se after Jobs turned in one of the employees of HP que visitaron research laboratories of the company in palo High, where it saw the first « ordenador table never done. ”</seg>
<seg id="39">It was so big as a suitcase, had a pequeña pantalla catódico of pipe, and I enamoré of him.</seg>
<seg id="40">Get a viaje until HP as an adolescent and perdería time with that machine and I would write programas para.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Sobre improvise innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new productos sobre the march.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pronto in his career, which is set to be a salesman selling a puñado basis points, asked him un customer si podía todo mount the team.</seg>
<seg id="44">Trabajando with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the assembly and the delivery of the devices finished.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, while I was in Apple, recalls the struggles faced by in the development of a mouse computer:</seg>
<seg id="46">« I agree to take dramatic arguments … I shouted que se need five years [for creating a ratón que would cost $300], and I harté y I went outside and found a designer.</seg>
<seg id="47">Noventa days later, we had a ratón que podíamos built for 15 and that was completely reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sobre large companies perdiendo force:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before that lead the renaissance of Apple, Jobs proféticamente previó the way in which many industry leaders tropezarían in his vision, and perderían control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">« Di que trabajas in IBM o Xerox, for what you do best fax machines and printers, and what? ”</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly of the market share, which is why the company has no more successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">The increase in sales and marketing success, so they are the kind of people that those returning from por running the business and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the forum for decision - making.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius of the products that led to this position of monopoly pudre por fault of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the job is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">That is what has happened in Xerox …</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox podría have hijacked the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">Podría have been ten times its tamaño, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s …</seg>
<seg id="57">Tomaron defeat of the victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Sobre innovation as artistic expression:</seg>
<seg id="59">« There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product … as it develops the great idea, changing and growing. ”</seg>
<seg id="60">Se learns a lot about the subtleties of the same.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are sacrificios que tienes que - do some things that you cannot make it to make the electrons, glass makes them, robots do, the factories make them.</seg>
<seg id="62">Tienes que 5,000 keep things in your brain - these concepts - adjusted todos at once —</seg>
<seg id="63">It all comes back to taste - rebaja exponerte to try to better than a team of human has done, but coming to adapt these things to which tu are doing.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that the good artists copy, great artists roban.</seg>
<seg id="65">We have had nunca vergüenza about stealing ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">That in part made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which incidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">Si, were it not for the computer, I could be doing wonderful things in other areas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia y Thomas cenan with rivals in the law of health care while the court accepts the case</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day that the Supreme Court se reunió door closed to examine the issue politically controversial whether to accept the challenge to the health care law President Obama 's, two of the justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas y agasajados were at a dinner patrocinada por the signing of lawyers will present the case before the high court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges reunieron in a preliminary hearing para study carefully the requests of review.</seg>
<seg id="4">Uno cases in question was a complaint lodged by 26 states challenging the entire reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for the conservative activists across the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed to take the demand and, in fact, we can expect a plea of historic 5 and a half hours to March, and the result will probably will further muddy the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the court 's decision was known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discontinued será probablemente Paul Clement 'as Attorney General of US during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that helped patrocinar annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been going on for many years devoted to the defence of the legal principles conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="8">Otra signature patrocinó dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Otro patrocinador was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner se held in a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the Court on the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican most important in the Senate and un opositor declared the law of health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">¿The special guests at the dinner? Scalia y Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Is nothing new: the two judges have been watching events in Federalist Society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Y is not something that is in conflict with the ethical standards.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Si are, it could be said that fall under the code Canon 4C, which it says: “ a judge can attend events to recaudar funds of organisations relacionadas with the law and otras, although the judge cannot be a orador, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Sin embargo, the proximity of absolute Scalia y Thomas to two of the lawyers in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">« This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the code is contrary to the demands of several judges who closely follows the court by the same rules that apply to all the judges se federal ”, said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (common cause).</seg>
<seg id="19">The judges were « agasajados in a recaudación funds shown with lawyers tienen cases pending before the court. ”</seg>
<seg id="20">Su appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event socava any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia y Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that mix too easily the tribunal 's work with the agenda driven by groups such as Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">Y 's wife, Ginni Thomas, is a prominent conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Por otra parte, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, that has a ético problema, not Scalia y Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan trabajó as procuradora general of the Obama administration when they were first presented the first legal challenges to the law in the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sus critics have been pushing to que se abstain Kagan of the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law and to now be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan has not given any indication that he is going to do.</seg>

<seg id="1">Serios Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the cuts automatic budget ahead podrían socavar national security and provocar una reacción financial chain from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the chains of assembly civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is ya digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now teme una reducción additional 600 billion or more in cuts que si puede ser imminent Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">« The impact of these cuts sería devastating for the department ”, Panetta said in a letter to the senators John McCain, a Republican por Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican por South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its result, the so - called “ secuestro », would lead to a 23% of reductions and global un high in many projects nuevos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">« Un recorte large tan, applied this indiscriminately, make the most of our projects naval and construction could not be carried out - you cannot buy tres quarters of a ship or an building - and seriously harm otros efforts of modernisation ”, Panetta wrote to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">También « we would be forced to remove many of our civil servants of intentional and, due to the reduction would impose so quickly, it is almost certain that tendríamos que licenciar civilians in order to meet the objective. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">These changes « romperían faith with those who continue our army and seriamente would damage the readiness. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts in time to reach the combat troops, Panetta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">« Si well funding for tiempos of war in the accounts of contingency operations overseas is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war verían adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of base ”, warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">« Procurement personnel reduciría, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war. ”</seg>
<seg id="12">« Staff in payroll se reduciría, leading to delays in payments to providers in time of war, and the support is legally and politically interrupted. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">« The result to a kidnap in the Department of Defense provocaría un rápido decline of the United States as the main potencia military in the world. ”</seg>
<seg id="15">« We are strongly against this draconian action », the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening when publicaron the Charter of Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">« This is not a result with which it is possible to live, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves. ”</seg>
<seg id="17">« The abduction is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and must not be allowed to ocurra. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Si the Charter of Panetta y recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget compromise, un o stepped up calls for exempting the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly vocal about the potential cuts, despite the fact that came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in the budgets in Congress and the White House sabiendo y que se faced difficult decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference last week, Secretary of Defense pintó un sombrío panorama of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a núcleo.</seg>
<seg id="21">« Is a ship without sailors. ”</seg>
<seg id="22">« Brigade is a sin bullets. ”</seg>
<seg id="23">« Is an air wing sin suficientes pilotos trained. ”</seg>
<seg id="24">« Is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without suficientes soldados suited to the mission ”, said Panetta in their words opening in the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">« Is a force that sufre low morale, the preparation and is not able to keep up to date with potential adversaries. ”</seg>
<seg id="26">In fact, « invites aggression » …</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an appendix to their letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta nuevos set out details of how the reductions « generate significant risks operativos: the time delay in response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; limited severamente nuestra capacity to be made and committed previamente around the world; and supone un riesgo unacceptable in future operaciones fighter. ”</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">¿Deception, how much are we?</seg>
<seg id="14">On an ordinary day, studies show that te pueden lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is for sure, many of these lies are white lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otro study showed that the unknown mentían tres veces in the first 10 minutes of getting to know.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Detecting lies, or “ the location of lies' skill, is an essential that we must acquire all, for reasons tanto personales as professionals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is crying out: “ you tengo », the detection of deception be lost knowledge seria based on scientific data obtenidos during the last six decades in prestigious universidades que realizaron proyectos of in - depth investigation, especially posts in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Uno of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies have been rebatidos.</seg>
<seg id="20">The liars sí look in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="21">Not always tartamudean, stuttering out, ruborizan o feel uneasy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It cannot be concluded tampoco que liars sean difficult to detect or expose.</seg>
<seg id="23">Un detector lies trained puede come to learn the truth about the structure of the statement, the expressions microfaciales, training of questions and the times.</seg>
<seg id="24">Pasé varios years sondeando discoveries scientists on the deception in the vast y siempre emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a technique which is easy to learn and to help navigate nuestro complex world - especially if sus responsabilidades profesionales include recruitment, interviews, and the management of negotiations.</seg>

<seg id="32">Observe the position of the person, risa y feature vocal.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is best I can usually golpetea si someone with the foot todo the time for not making accusations unfair when will see the foot golpeteando in half of the meeting.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="35">Consider these groups of behaviour as hard alarm, not as evidence of deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The people who cheat pueden freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember su history, can point sus pies for the door, lean towards a salida, change its stance significantly o display a « comfort postentrevista » — that exaggerated suspiro of relief, and change of position que una vez todas difficult questions have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Often the interrogators makes out falsely que solo para has ended the interview that seek relief postentrevista.</seg>

<seg id="41">The indicators verbales more common sutiles.</seg>
<seg id="42">Can someone usar un pile of “ language restrictivo » when replied to a question difficult: “ Well … to tell the truth … so what I se … in my opinion. ”</seg>
<seg id="43">This means that the answer is una percepción instead of a fact, and it is often a señal warning.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="3">The possibility of counting « voto por voto » is a reality in regards to the electoral process in this year in Michoacán, where according to the data right out of the programme of election results preliminares (PREP) the difference between primero y segundo place in the election for governor is only 27%, yet to be counted the votes for 879 6 thousand totales 74 minutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this regard, the chairman of the Council 's General Election Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Maria Los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, barely on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize the local rules with the reform federal on election issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">As you will remember, not Michoacán homologó su political constitution or its Electoral Code of the state or su justice bill Election, while the state 's Congress approved the reforms poco before concluding the legal deadline for que pudieran come into force in this process and the governor Leonel Godoy, Rangel omitió su publicación on schedule in the law of Periódico oficial of the state, on the grounds that it had a few objections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolvió controversy constitutional promovida por the Power legislative local and described as “ invalid and illegal ” the vote of the leftist state constitutional reforms, has no right to “ sancionarlas o vetarlas ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Interviewed on the possibility nay por voto », Maria Los Angeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the lines corresponding to parte of the General Council of the IEM será posible achieving recuentos parciales y totales of the election by the local election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In this way, the counting of votes, parcial of one or more paquetes election, will be in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and computing in the dossier on the box o obre not in possession of the President of the same; or, if there are errors or disruptions of the minutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, the counting of the vote total recibida in all the boxes of the election podrá realizarse when there is a sign that the difference between the candidate presunto winner of the election in question and which has received the second place in the vote, is equal to or less of one percentage point; always y when, at the beginning of the sitting there is the explicit request from the representative of the party and / or coalition postuló to the second of the candidates señalados.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The count total of Voting may also realizarse si at the end of the computation ordinario se establishes that the difference between the candidate presuntamente ubicado winner, the second is equal to or less of one percentage point, if and when there is an explicit request from the representative of the political party whose candidate quedó second case, in which it will exclude packages electoral have been counting parcial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is worth mentioning that in such a situation is the choice of Morelia, where we agree with the PREP the difference between the first and second place is barely por 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 minutes of 923 totales.</seg>

<seg id="5">Se expected to present un cabinet is largely made up of tecnócratas, although it is not clear when the office will assume the new executive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said that the President presentará the outcome of their talks with political parties in their attempt to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">« Quiero confirm my absolute confidence in our country 's ability to overcome this difficult phase ”, said the former European Commissioner to journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti did not say explicitly that podrá form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the hurdles are have superados.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new government led by former European Commissioner Mario Monti must adopt a hard paquete of austerity demanded by european leaders to recuperar the battered confidence in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Subrayando pressure on Monti to se hurry up, the instability of the markets put the performance of italian bonds BTP to 10 years for above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland will be vieron obligadas to be rescatadas.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support para apply what will probably serán reformas unpopular austerity.</seg>

<seg id="23">Pondrá end to their ronda meetings on Tuesday night.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Rescatar to Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Amediados of 80, at the height of the now defunct Corporation metropolitan Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed unos pasquines promotion Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leaflet defined the mountain as the great parque of the Barcelona Metropolitan.</seg>
<seg id="6">What is more, they attached a comparison figures, with the Central Park New Yorker.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park volvió to be placed in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that are not geared to the north - south axis sino - down mountain (above) (Sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The rating of Collserola as parque natural redunda on this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference ya Central Park was not sino Yellowstone, with jabalís in the role of the bear Yogi.</seg>
<seg id="10">In these was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 competitions for otras tantas puertas access to Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Una puerta remite to the idea for the theme park, without a doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">O that or someone pretende poner puertas to the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question sale sola: Collserola, parque o mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The competition, both for its vertiente merely organizativa and what it means for reflection on the city is the topic of conversation between all the architects people of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is now almost un tema recurrente to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of elected se reconocen in a lift.</seg>
<seg id="16">Y this leads, quite rightly, to one of the few similarities between what tres architects people of Barcelona, and profesores universitarios, that it has been.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol y Marta Bayonne: the contest is timely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Para Roldán, having dealt with the coastline « se is necessary ” to discuss « the mountain ”, while the speech Ildefons Cerdà, apples verdes, has not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="19">« Partir is on the basis that the park more extensive Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things by their great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex », according to the architect para quien the title of “ puertas of Collserola » contains a « trampa léxica »: we must not think of “ as the entrance to a theme park, but the demarcation of zonas where we need to act. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mòdol, as Roldán y Bayonne with experience in the world urbanístico, called the proposal “ reto intellectual » with “ certain risk ».</seg>
<seg id="23">Peligros derived from “ uncertain that is today proyectar public space » tras experience in the 1980s, and que tuvo in the area of the Fòrum « su swan ».</seg>
<seg id="24">The first temor is the very definition of borders where they can build.</seg>
<seg id="25">« Limit something is already setting the next step, which is to say, its » sobrepaso.</seg>
<seg id="26">« We need to think of new instruments urbanísticos, planning, because the current [in reference to the plan General Metropolitan (PGM)] pueden lead to real disasters ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Leaner to the question, Mòdol opina que, simplifying, the alaskan vallesana of Collserola « puede understood, the park as a Barcelona, no ”, a point merely topográfica.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mòdol recuerda que ya there is a trabajo made by Patronat of Collserola que « must not fall on deaf ears », while grateful for the opportunity that the City ofrece his body to intervene in this project « from the first moment. ”</seg>
<seg id="29">Y even more, he understands that the closeness of the mountain in the city is the salvoconducto que permite architects to enter the debate, but “ doubt ” sobre si is this profile técnico must lead the disciplinary teams (“ everything right, un » points) have had to create: “ the architects should be solo una tool ”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayonne insinuated that the answer to the question that gives título to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the contest is a lack of global visión Collserola: “ you have called 16 contests transversales - says - mountain - sea, but there is no reading longitudinal, look at y understands the area as a whole. ”</seg>
<seg id="31">This causes, at least in its case, which has opted for participar in 16 contests.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, a project for una doors puede clash in programa y definition of the architect of the door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, the city should ensure that the lower the Round Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that making a suave transición between the city and the verde.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">At the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed seis relevantes element in the research:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Vuelo visual:</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the normalisation aerospace flight se realizó under visual flight rules, this means that the crew should have visibilidad during the flight and the ground.</seg>

<seg id="21">The coordinates of impact and the last entry of the aircraft of the radar coincide, probably before the impact was no loss of control or disruption in the flight path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Dispersal of remains of the aircraft in an area reducida:</seg>
<seg id="23">The information available so far permiten suponer que ocurrió the impact on a course recta y aside.</seg>
<seg id="24">The pattern of dispersion of remains of the aircraft permiten suponer que the helicopter stunned on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Social una investigation to find out the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported in specialists from the IPN</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that runs a research to find the gene of obesity in children and young people, so - called protocolo « genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence », which will have markers associated to overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In a statement, the head of the unity of medical research in biochemistry Hospital of specialities Medical Center of the National Siglo 21st century, Cross Miguel Lopez, explained that they were integrated un multi - disciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutriólogos y trabajadoras sociales.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">That team is supported by specialists and students graduate from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and of the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) Institute 's National Politécnico (IPN.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In research to be invited to participate in which the public is not o derechohabiente, go to the units of the sporting participantes IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where it is carried out tests to minors, all Saturdays from 8: 00 a. m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stressed that the protocol began in the unit sporting Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since 8 October, it is carried out in Unity State of Mexico sporting Nezahualcóyolt (East).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Una vez que se complies with the aim of bringing 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the unit sporting independence (south Federal District) and finally in unity sporting Morelos (north of the federal district).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify mexican risk factors for prevenir the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The held this November 14 World of diabetes, specified que the aim is to raise to three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervisión of their parents, for the application of questionnaires specific food.</seg>

<seg id="12">Detailed que se Saturdays applies to all participants measurements antropométricas (peso, talla, waist circumference of), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, cholesterol levels, triglycerides and insulin y genetic (seeks to identify gene associated with child obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz Lopez señaló que obedece this research to the concern of the professional health by the alarming increase in weight in the minors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">« Surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 señalaron que in just six years, there was an increase in the case of children, from 77 percent in obesidad, and girls of 47%; overweight también se observó un dramatic rise », underlined the specialist in IMSS.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asphalt of the UNAM avoid potholes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, a senior researcher at the chemistry of the UNAM, develops asfaltos modified with polímeros para producir una mixed with better performance, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Si the signals that sends the pavement were met, it would not require repairing potholes about $200 each season of rain in the area Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Nájera Herrera, a senior researcher at the power of chemistry (FQ) UNAM si, who ensured that the process of building and maintaining a pavimento asfáltico is the right one, the cracks podrían reducirse in quantity or, indeed, be completely removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In its Conference an opinión tecnológica of potholes, handed down in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, made it known that the laboratory to his office develops asfaltos modified with polímeros para producir una mixed with semejantes characteristics to the tarmac, but with a greater resistance mechanics, both high and low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of asfaltos modified podrían utilizarse in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the training of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt, the main bulk of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, high - molecular peso, called asfaltenos, and other low - weight, so - called molecular maltenos that together they give to pavimento su characteristic viscoelástico behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The behaviour of the viscoelástico asphalt is that at high temperatures, close to the 180 degrees, acts as a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade su viscosidad is extremely high, and to 50 degrees centigrade presenta un state almost sólido, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt se vuelve quebradizo, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but rather we are going changing during the day, according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in engineering química.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The investigator 's FQ observó que the streets of Mexico City in its majority are covered by pavimento flexible, which is made up of six layers of materials, including the last three involving the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the more superficial se the file tar, shaped by pequeñas piedras bathed in asphalt and then compactadas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each of the piedritas que is the file, pointed out, is stained with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transitar vehicles and generated efforts, this permite que forces spread very well on the pavement.</seg>
<seg id="13">Si se tratara asphalt amended se difundirían even better, felt the engineer químico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The file sobre tar, he is a veritable última layer called file rolling, which is made of a material of stone fine, which is to say, a sand that también se washes in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As this is the layer that va to be in contact with the tyres of vehicles, must have more mechanical than the file tar y proporcionar friction in the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">As part of the pavimento que va to receive and disseminate the efforts, the file rolling requiere also have the thickness and appropriate se must take care of the material is made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, in particular the water, he said, because it affects considerably to the performance of the file tar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the field was humedece, water in the interior of the file and it is difficult for salga, it causes un reblandecimiento of all sections of the pavimento y, therefore, the training of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the process of forming a pothole, he said, is the first to wear the film of rodamiento y sólo then it affects the file tar, but the damage is not instantly, but that is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with appropriate programas of maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Who is also a member of the system 's National researchers explained that the vehicular burden is another important factor in the training of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of pavimento must always be in connection with the vehicular burden y to ensure that it complied with, to avoid potholes are often.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and trabajar sobre the asphalt, for example, emulsiones tar, which in other countries ya se are even in the market and permiten reparar the cracks easily and at no need to use high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Valle recibe su título número 14 princesa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Valley Cauca se queda with the appetite for the crown of señorita Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time Melina Ramírez Serna tuvo que se shape with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the group who the show as a new princesa of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the reins, the department ya suma 14 títulos of princesa Melina un y se the legion of women vallecaucanas que have been close to the crown pero que were proclamas princesas including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Elizabeth Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Today, the big question is how many are doing what was lacking?</seg>
<seg id="8">Porque the outcome represents the defeat of a great favourite que in each presentación showed that she had todo para ser the new señorita Colombia, not in vain was elected as Queen of the Police y Better Face Jolie of Vogue, que obtuvieron reinas as Taliana Natalia Vargas o Navarro quien se led the crown of señorita Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor that is considered key to the decision taken by the jury to appoint its members primera princesa radica in which not impressed with its response to the question “ what is this book that te has marked by y por qué? made by Martín Gómez Murillo, the cart literary Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The interrrogante the vallecaucana respondió:</seg>
<seg id="11">« Leo, I find it quite a lot in the literature, I believe it is a form of culturalizarse definitely, I believe that the book that I marked childhood is “ the principito », the book is quite serious.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently I read “ crime and punishment ”, is a book of world literature que todos must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, one Russian, a book called “ beautiful que se the heat of ». ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Una respuesta poco primero por que liked the term “ culturalizarse » y segundo por not to explain in a particular how each of the books that have cited the set.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pero at the end of the ceremony, said Melina sentirse tranquila y happy with the result « the universe is wise pasa what pasar.</seg>
<seg id="15">Para toda y people, please read un poquito, “ the principito » is a great book ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among the scenarios launched se says that the Valle quemó favouritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">Un periodista bogotano hinted that the preferred, the ovacionada y the woman candidate who came wearing a todos prizes preliminares (reto of gastronomy Oster, vote from the public about the best traje artisanal, and Queen Mother), “ that was the jealousy of the other candidates, estresó Queen y por that shone in the scenario ”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is y notó in her first speech in bathing in the beach 's Hilton y sus two parades in the evening of coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">But in both lució segura, notó que lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena y Atlantic sí showed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the “ at home ”, as the channel RCN opinó que the fact that Melina appointed princesa « notes that the candidate, more premios wins during the contest is not as reina ».</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle se showed the last very elusive, with the press, and that is where we are wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Otra hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury sobre su interest in social work, which is in últimas, the essence of the National beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">Por something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who is committed to social needs of its pais.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">« Beauty sola is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and social focus in your sensitivity, which before entering the contest are involved in projects », explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">También se speculation that Valle pecó por sus flaws in the derriere fibrosis y que se I noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory pues precisamente the jury chose as the candidate « beauty natural ” with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical trabajo responsable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The preparador of Hernán reinas Jorge Orozco reconoce que Melina was not the best body, which had better, “ but su problema of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for my was not highly visible, I fell puntos on the last day. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the surgeries que se practicó.</seg>
<seg id="28">« The surgeries are fine, but it is not the Valle supo do.</seg>
<seg id="29">Su body nunca was his strong and here is the claimed ».</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Por this prize, which for the first time released the contest 's National Bold, after the parade in bathing surgió cruel vaticinio que un last night he performed, he said that this was the contentillo que Raymundo denied to Melina para not to give them a taste of the krona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Realidad o not, the fact is that from today Melina begins year reign, not as soberana, but as princesa, a position that it offers the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the competitions in international 's own National nomination contest.</seg>

<seg id="2">The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has taken place without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and presidenta Party 's Christian Democrat.</seg>
<seg id="3">Initially had not been included in the order of the day, the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular for satisfacer to militants who believe that the government 's policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and podría serlo in a future with the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="4">The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted prácticamente por unanimidad.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of 1.001 delegates, only se registraron nueve votos against and 10 abstentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The standing ovation of several minutes that won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and after hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, europhile cleared out any possible doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main thrust of the Chancellor, and of the motion, resumen in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe is peace, but also because « nueve million jobs depend directly on the euro. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Para Chancellor, “ the time has come to lead the way in Europe. ”</seg>
<seg id="10">This could result in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon in order to grant reforzar control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but I could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission for sufragio universal para « making it a reality to Europe. ”</seg>
<seg id="11">In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Sin doubt, it is improbable for 27 to arrive quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain hostile to him y leaders of the CDU parecen saber que Nicolas Sarkozy also.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pero the ball on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="14">Por otro side, the delegates have rejected por una overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank in terms of weight of each economy, which obviously reforzaría Germany 's weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Eager to calm down on the inside of her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is seeking to win his Congress at the expense of the “ small ” países or european countries in difficulties prepared to criticise the arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of “ friendship Franco - german », Angela Merkel has not - discussed to France.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition, to accompany tal ofensiva, that part of the desire to save a rigorous, but still recuerda an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">First of all, for cuts presupuestarios: the government plans to impose private sector workers un fourth day of lack of power before taking the low.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In short, unless there is a convention of company specific, a worker falls ill que perdería four days of pay, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">Se trata a measure that could stir up a oleada of anger but one that can allow save 280 billion, according to Les Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure to a more symbolic: imposing officials un day, remuneración in case of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">As we discuss these issues, most vuelve to putting on the table is also the subject of the fraud, this time orientado towards the abuses of the low labour.</seg>
<seg id="10">« Van will substantially increase the controls and, in addition, if discovered someone committing a fraud, must reimburse the sums », warned Xavier Bertrand talking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of the announcement parecen slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of low labour.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, since 2002 realiza un seguimiento constant in this matter and have launched several ofensivas políticas que, normally have borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are ill more than in the rest of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Look carefully, first, the national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">Según the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 was paid more than EUR 237 million entitlement por low labour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Según the French Institute for Research and documentation of the economy 's health, subsidies for low representaron, in 2008, 5% of health spending, rising to 11.300 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this sum, 46% up to maternity and por industrial accidents, while 54% is connected with the sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Por, 2.5% of spending on health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have taken una average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group soul Consulting.</seg>
<seg id="20">Una half that, without a doubt, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the syrian professional management Monster. com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 french employees surveyed said that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Otro study, in this case the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the sick leave tuvieron una less than eight days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Si compared with our european neighbours, french workers are not more likely than in other areas to get sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="23">Un long study in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall lack of work (both in razones health and other oscilaba), in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to a 20% and a 28% in Denmark, a 15% Kingdom and between a 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id="25">The fraud is un - fairly limited.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of the sick leave of more than 45 few days will be sistemáticos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in a 13% of the 285.000 realizados, that the low short - term were “ unjustified o » too long, which is to say, 37.050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were “ properly tailored o unjustified; a figure, taking in transactions un total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Por, makes a total of 169.000 cases unjustified » between several millions of workers that they took a sickness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sin doubt, a figure insignificant in comparison with, for example, the work in the black.</seg>
<seg id="31">Según the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, the practice representaría unas pérdidas income tax of 9 - 15 billion euros per year, which is more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, no doubt, considerably more than the fraud in the latter.</seg>

<seg id="21">While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key component of the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the utility industry in the national territory, the french companies benefit from cheaper electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">Por that reason, any reduction significativa of nuclear energy supondría una sharp rise in the price of electricity, which restaría realismo to the wonderful statements on industrialization of our country and the defence of our power purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">Se trata a price the vast majority of the French are refusing to pay and, in fact, not oposición por principio to this type of energy polls show.</seg>

<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintaining the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a security exercises control strict and transparent tanto sobre existing plants as on the construction of Flamanville.</seg>

<seg id="37">The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did the previous two.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and operators and developers, the french and german EPR presenta un design able to withstand such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While they studied by all the players want to build an electric power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville sería un great gift for competitors from Areva and EDF, as it would leave them vía free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear industry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration, a burden or a oportunidad para economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised partiendo from various points of view: the saturation of police services, administrative and judicial sometidos policy figures, the compatibility of this policy, with the status of self - proclaimed “ country of human rights ” of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have jumped back into the headlines, with the interior minister (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclamando past que France “ does not need foreign talentos, Workers and waiters ».</seg>
<seg id="4">Sin embargo are rarely the moment analyses from an economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a lot of consensus between the left and the right.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the guidance declaring in 1976 which « 900 unemployed should not be a problema para que un país has almost two million workers immigrants ”, while on the left, it set the tone, Michel Rocard, explaining that France “ cannot take charge for the misery of the world ” in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, both the left and the right who shared the fear of the invasion of the territory national una multitude of polish plumbers.</seg>
<seg id="9">On both sides, and it is felt that immigrants are a burden for the economy and society in France.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they operate with regard to immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme, François Hollande se confined to include trivia, indicating that the co - development permitirá solucionar “ problema of migration ”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps resulta rentable electorally, but economically sale very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tal as economists Ian Goldin y Geoffrey Cameron on a building site reciente que resume knowledge most recent immigration (Exceptional People: how Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists in the positive impact of the migratory flows in economic growth, the wage and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The limitation of immigration perjudica weakens growth and employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears relating to the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea that these can sustituir for national workers, in particular the poorly skilled, by pressing to que se reduzcan sus salarios.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pero experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are more complementary sustitutos of workers and national exercise principalmente profesiones in sectors with the lack of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="17">Immigrants poco qualified trabajan in sectors that do not attract workers and more skilled in sectors where the dynamic training does not meet the demand of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Un positive effect on salaries</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the same way that a surgeon tendría difficulty working one that will be lack of anestesistas, complementarity between national and immigrants provoca que the arrival of the past have an impact on wages and the use of the national.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teniendo all this in mind, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase of migratory flows presents una subida in real wages in the long - term of between 0.6 un y 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Y, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants are making contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (there is a large share Nobel Prize y naturalized american companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay y Yahoo was founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants also son net contributors to the social systems, since they bring to a 1% of the total budget in european countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organisation estimates that, for example, in Germany by immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years realizará una contribution net income (less) expenses of EUR 150 public budgets on average during his lifetime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek points of growth that he lacked « teeth ».</seg>
<seg id="25">These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="3">The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and nigerian sect Boko Haram, on which sospechaba for some time, have been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Sunday, the Deputy Algerian Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even argued that Algiers ya « tiene certainty ».</seg>

<seg id="6">Paris it seems to come to a similar conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation into the kidnapping of two frenchmen in Niger last January have reanudado the gateways.</seg>
<seg id="8">Raptados in a restaurant in Niamey por personas relacionadas with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour y Vincent Delory died the next day, along with several of its secuestradores following an operation launched by french special forces.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">The study indicates calls made to several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">Según radio France Internationale (RFI), numbers embezzled especially the interest of the researchers: one leads to a nigerian que permaneció for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, presumably, is close to Aqmi y to the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">« Se trata progress, but certainly we must expect to have more formal pruebas before talk of operational cooperation between Aqmi y Boko Haram ».</seg>
<seg id="14">Pero « is possible ”.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">In recent months, these “ support » had been increasingly evident in the development and the speeches of Boko Haram o in their ways operativos, now involving the use of suicide bombers o explosive devices and increasingly complex in the same way that those used for Aqmi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, beginning with Washington, is since then to presionando Abudja para que tenga account of the problems created by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The nigerian authorities, in fact, have long been considered the group as a community of enlightened poco worthy of interest.</seg>

<seg id="21">In this region pobre, the association is experiencing a éxito rápido.</seg>
<seg id="22">Se politiza y requires a respeto strict Sharia law, while its militant throw to the fight against the central government godless.</seg>

<seg id="25">The reaction of Abudja was, as so often happens, widespread.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army attacked the city and registraron 800 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested in life, receives the death in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since then, the sect se radicaliza y abandons its strongholds in the north.</seg>
<seg id="29">Last Christmas, claims un attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, later, another in Abudja.</seg>
