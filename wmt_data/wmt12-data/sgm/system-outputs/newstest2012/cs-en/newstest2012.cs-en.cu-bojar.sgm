<h1>
<seg id="1">Makeup artist must also be a good psychologist, says the pros</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the opening section on how to teach stylists, I am a little bit complained that it had in the early hours.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had no idea what will happen next.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lectures of three professionals in the field, wearing black characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will get worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even if the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, is really `` crowded ''.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we are discussing with the director Alice (in the exchange rate is not the only kid), dressed as a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical shape.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And such is the overwhelming majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone has a short neck, someone 's boyish figure without curves and some overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Makeup artist must know how optically soften his broad shoulders, extended his neck or to supply the necessary curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We got so tips, both for women like Jennifer Lopez, the greater her breasts and hips and a narrow waist, figure pretty stressed and at the same time a woman dressed too challenging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, is the difference between the waist and hips that skirts or trousers really fit, then it pays to have made at least one of these to peace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly you will not regret it, because the perfect - fitting clothing is priceless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In a skirt to peace will feel much better than the one that you are constantly shifting, shrugs, stood in the middle and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The boyish figure, he can afford to wear clothes with folds, applications, embroidery or scooped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Such information and the type of characters are, of course, many, so I am glad that I have a week to all of the information in the mind of the sort out.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I fear that, due to the domestic task is not enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the kurzistek gets assigned to the celebrity, which has come up with two outfits: the day and evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to take into account the current design, fashion and style of the personality of the type of character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I will be the `` dress ''Miranda Kerrovou, perhaps you know it from the campaigns of Victoria 's Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the spirit of the jubilant, for me personally, certainly better than a Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (please do not take into account the hyperbole), or very young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">We must avoid outfits from magazines or search on the Internet and print and graphically process.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moodboard, the result, he says, then express my personal style and the relationship to design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">I think about the video site stylingu is important.</seg>
<seg id="26">A stylist, dresses only physically, but also build, for example, the so - called product site in magazines (in particular the award, for example, trends, bags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">It told us a stylist and designer Mario stonemasonry.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it until Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Makeup artist must have a general overview</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturday 's lecture loaded with information on the types of characters at three guests from the field.</seg>
<seg id="31">Makeup artist John Humble, fashion designer James Polanky and fashion photographer Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub remind us that fashion is an illusion and stylist should know how to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a stylist knows how to work with a single piece of clothing in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variability in this case is the key.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So a trenchcoat (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) you can wear a classically over jeans and t - shirt, but you can wear on his body, his shoes and photographed as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just roll up their sleeves and collars, and now the whole look is different.</seg>
<seg id="37">`` Play with it, ''he stressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most of all I appreciate the following advice: `` you need to work a perfect knowledge of the rules. ''</seg>
<seg id="39">`` Then you can start to break, ''said Jim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, I am not clear why the smashing all those lessons, what with the combined, why, why, as well as in fashion magazines often we see something else.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the show, not to mention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben again, I know that the stylist must have produced a lot more options than clothes, how many of them are taking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="43">So in a fashion story, which will have 10 pages (ten outfits), I have to be ready to `` nastajlovat ''at least fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also that a picture of the dress looks and works in combination with other pieces of often quite different than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With that, then we have got to in the formation of the outfits count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and style is often half of success, we confirmed John Humble.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna, who is not just a singer, but the image and marketing of the World Star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic 's approach to the use of the services of a makeup artist rather cold.</seg>
<seg id="49">The familiar faces, it often considered unnecessary (just something I can do, how to be subordinated).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if they get from us someone will create a styling, then we expect us to dictate a completely different (smaller) size than it really is.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then there 's than googlovat and find out if the Boulevard of the celebrity ztoustla / weight and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">John and Mario on Sunday to a makeup artist is not enough to fashion and be able to put the outfits.</seg>
<seg id="53">In their work, in particular, he interacts with people who dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">I can not judge people, pandering to stand up for his opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">`` When you get a manager, to all out her wardrobe and with some nice things, so you can not throw out of the closet and say, oh, my God. ''</seg>
<seg id="56">`` There are at least a few of the things he said and recommend what to wear, ''says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">We also specifically pointed out what it must include the so - called `` placovka '', or the bag on the field.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is that which you turn around and you have all the necessary accoutrements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In addition to clear things, such as the cylinder on hair or safety pins, there are also silk thread (with her stylist helps out for photos of products, such as handbags and hats), special clips, to join in the back of the clothes, if it is more (a pin or another clip is not acceptable, that would suit), or a sewing kit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">To hear, but also a practical test, we learned how to properly relined shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even at a photo shoot in the studio, which is equal to the surface, I could damage, let alone out there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And so we are stuck, stuck.</seg>
<seg id="63">The pair of shoes, was not hurt.</seg>
<seg id="64">So the real skill.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario please me, when my creation without reservations, he said.</seg>
<seg id="66">The skill that really is not my friend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a tiny fraction of what we do on the second weekend of course listened to.</seg>
<seg id="68">I am getting more and more clear that, given the stylingu on a professional level really is not a walk in the park, to say what they want.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Need for speed: the Run, racing across the whole of America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Originally Easy Rider, because of a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes change in routine morning trip to shift.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ambition is to a large extent met, but it 's no good, when no one is reluctant to do anything more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">New part: the run up to the high expectations.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised that the age - old racing series of Need for speed again moves a new direction and a playable demos, appeared as a game, which would be in the genre of action racing might not be the only in number.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were also curious about the passages in which the hero gets out of the car and will be on their own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But, as in a series of NFS is customary, many of them in the outcome of a little differently than we expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are potentially decent arcade racing, but the whole drags down several unnecessary errors, which is in a series of appear more or less for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So it was not the error, but rather the manifestation of some incomprehensible lazy developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the story, in which the hero Jack has some problems of a personal nature and the solution is to be participating in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">Behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea has some interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into 10 stages, and then to more than fifty businesses.</seg>
<seg id="16">The result of this is that every race is run on a route and the stage is set in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.</seg>
<seg id="17">So does not even have a sense that the game is still the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some of the environment, moreover, are very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of graphics corresponds to the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it 's no big deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the journey across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The race is, in addition, from time to time complicated by some kind of amusing element.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the desert, for example, few in the storm, which greatly reduces visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">By contrast, in the mountains, you have to pay attention to you in an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Next to it are quite well for him at the individual races.</seg>
<seg id="25">It 's not just a few types, but it' s enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is now trying to pass the required number of rivals (in the classic race), then you are driving time (a classic duel with a stopwatch) and then waiting for you to be a duel with a single match.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is even more from time to time he gets and the police, which all your efforts even more unpleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">News of the outside of the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">Instead, it is only on such interactive animations, when Jack mostly run from someone and you must help so that, in the right moments of pressing the right buttons.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing too complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Surprise but that these passages in the game a lot less than you might expect (specifically, perhaps even only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, but it 's a good thing, because this element does not have the chance to become poisonous, and in the context of the question is one of the elements that game break.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model comes in the wake of the previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that in today 's world is not everything, but we can not say that would be drawbacks.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the action - based racing here the model is still quite well, although we in the competition to find a better.</seg>
<seg id="37">Thus far, perfectly all right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the problems are starting to appear at a time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the model of a very fine is not a model of conflict.</seg>
<seg id="40">From the games of this type, we expect that the complex distortions and conflict, but when virtually no impact on any object, you do not have the faintest idea how your car it, then it 's all right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typically in a tight overtaking or passing cars in normal operation, sometimes only slightly each other at, but at other times in almost identical situation will end your car in the wild pirouettes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even the right to smithereens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system - it does not matter, but annoyed you can reliably.</seg>
<seg id="44">The system is designed so that if I or you go far beyond the track, he will throw you a game back on the last point of reference on the track.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the system is in every race available only five.</seg>
<seg id="46">If it is not, you have to race to start from the beginning again.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is therefore a such a device for the case, that something was wrong, but that it might actually be relied upon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, but not - they will not help solve it is up to the need to learn the section of the plant from memory.</seg>
<seg id="49">The malady of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some of the curvy, for example, is the need to go through a specific way, otherwise they just come in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sometimes you will meet at the site of the `` civilian ''cars is always in the same configuration of whatever you get there first, fifth, five seconds sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="52">It sucks, especially in situations where you can see how between two oncoming cars opponent before you easily pass through, and when you get there, you are already cars in a position that is you have to drive around or slow down.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is one thing to them, you get, because it is `` doomed ''so that the situation there was always just before your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents also have another advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">For all the time playing in several places, where you, again, regardless of the time, always gets the same opponent in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">Most of the hits in the game on a bridge, where you are going in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The opposition is there in front of you must have apparently not at any price.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it 's in front of you, so you have exacerbated by an oncoming cars, so at first, about a couple of nice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting, adrenaline, but it is so obvious that you can reliably quickly.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it 's a shame, because, despite a simple model is playing entertaining and sometimes even enough action, that sometimes literally hectic track, where the flies.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is, in essence, one, whether it is the concept with his unique lines, ranking factories to boredom did not stand a chance, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The non - traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.</seg>
<seg id="63">You have to be careful at a gas station on the roads, because that 's where you can change the car, although in most cases you can get away with what you have got.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sports cars are appropriate in urban areas, a strong american cars to equal the highway and exotic Supersport on technical driving, for example, along the winding mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">With the main story scheme goes hand in hand and mode of calls, which are the races in each location, which you know the story.</seg>
<seg id="67">There is not only the medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to the challenges of the story.</seg>
<seg id="68">For a higher level of driver unlocks different objects, from the cars and the background to the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is at the same time again linked with on - line functions of Autolog, which, among other things, compare your results with other players and raises another community functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the more difficult to comprehend kicks, is the situation of the last race in the story.</seg>
<seg id="71">In his car in a subway tunnel (is), where they are pushing in the dark on the tracks of (a).</seg>
<seg id="72">On the odometer you are flashing numbers between 150 and 200 km / h (is) and in the back - line metro and uncompromising you grinding.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the newsroom for me for a few more days will hold a debate on whether, in the formation of the game no one really think, or whether we have the authors for really that big a fool.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side of the game is not great, but at least the visual effect is, in most cases, a very pleasant and, in a few cases, even brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="75">Upset so that, in some intense moments is falling, and that in some cases quite tragic.</seg>
<seg id="76">It concerns but, above all, car crashes with a number of participants, the smooth - it was no use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The site is in order and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In an attempt to appeal to the widest range of a younger audience a soundtrack from `` there '', but it is safe to assume that because of listening to music in the game only about someone will buy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of the Need for speed: the Run is quite embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game to avoid unnecessary errors, then I say, that 's the best run of NFS in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But this game is nedodělaně.</seg>
<seg id="82">Fun is certainly good, but get ready for it, that you are bang in the eyes of the strength of the airport floodlights.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">`` The Treaty of Lisbon have tipped the balance between the institutions. ''</seg>
<seg id="4">`` I did not expect it to be so tough war. ''</seg>
<seg id="5">`` It will take five, six years before the situation a little bit, and calms down than all the players are used to their new roles, ''she said, his speech at the Faculty of Law of the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As far as its motto `` clearly and openly about Europe ''takes seriously, she showed in the first part of the course, where she was able to describe the EU institutions and their relations so easy - and clearly she could be that many of the speakers from the Law Faculty of envy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">`` At first appeared criticism that is flat, that is the official, that he can not play any role, and I have to say that all the breath out of that role very well for himself. ''</seg>
<seg id="9">`` This is a man who can listen to the twenty - seven Member States, well done to communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said in response to the question: `` who is the European Union? on which a phone number to call? ''and, therefore, a major step in the unification and greater legibility of EU policy on countries such as China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">None of us wants to prohibit cheesed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Vicenová went on to the agenda, which the European Council was, is and will live in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech Presidency has identified as a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs have handled the financial crisis, with the gas or hold a summit for the Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the government at this time he has identified as a big negative, which the Czech Republic very severely damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the Ambassador, `` really slow ''was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that was resolved today.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, has yet to approve a new seven - year budget of the Union, which is due to the current economic situation far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whether the budget will be a lean and efficient, that the industry will be given priority, that the country will be supported by more and more, all of that is on the agenda of the next meeting.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the ambassador to the Czechs reputation euroskeptics, and people who do not pay attention more negative than positive aspects of the case.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, she was sorry low representation of the Czechs in the european institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fault is under a lot of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write letters, but also low support from the czech side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency then underlined the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad quartet.</seg>
<seg id="29">`` Believe me, when it comes to me polish and hungarian and Slovak, so the Frenchman next to me said, `` Hey, what 's out there, what' s your Visegrad four? `` and never looked happy. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the future, the Union under Vicenová are especially tough new rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a very real, the concept of a two speed, if not a multi - speed Europe, rather than the new `` European Federation. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">`` We have the euro - zone countries and countries outside the eurozone. ''</seg>
<seg id="33">`` We have the Schengen area, we have had and the Institute of enhanced cooperation. ''</seg>
<seg id="34">`` For the first time it was told to cooperate only countries that want to, and those who do not want to be standing close. ''</seg>
<seg id="35">`` The Institute will be more, and it will be a two - speed Europe, ''expects Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this respect, also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle, according to which all of the issues that have an impact on the whole of the Union, the discussion between all the Member States, not only between the countries of the euro area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brand Story:</seg>
<seg id="2">An innovator IBM begins the second century of his existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Someone looking for words that convey the strategy of IBM, say `` long term ''.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public 's IBM symbol of the technological revolution, it is the name of the perceived as very current, and yet, since its founding more than a hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this long term laid the first head of the firm, a visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.</seg>
<seg id="6">He coined the word that many of the world 's problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His motto, `` Think! ''in the past, which will form the basis for the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal magazine, which in IBM began to be based in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">It was also the basis for Watson carefully cultivated corporate culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">`` For us from IBM 's long - term thinking of continuous movement toward the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and prospered, a hundred years due to remain true to its core values, and it is not all about change.</seg>
<seg id="11">It allowed us to during our first centuries of transformative technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second hundred that we can do even more, ''he said to the anniversary of the current chairman of the company 's Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The elaborate system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson in the 1930 s to care for their employees as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic - the IBM was one of the first american workers paid vacation, insurance from their employer, plus an elegant staffing uniform and an elaborate system to reward the best inventors, and traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">As advanced has long - term IBM and the relationship with the customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company has since the beginning of the genius in the extraction of talent - as one of the first global firms to abolish discrimination of any kind, so he could collect.</seg>
<seg id="17">In accordance with the strategy of the anti - discrimination is the current plan that Palmisano, IBM in the lead in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">The IBM in the work of thirty years, still holds the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in recent years doing so - called yams, on - line brainstorms, of which raises many future strategies and innovation.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is no wonder that the ideas is enough - the company he works for almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The institution with a good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The firm position in business gives us a strong internal and external image.</seg>
<seg id="23">`` From the beginning, IBM, rather than just the concept of the institution of technology companies, ''said Economistu Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">`` IBM 's technology company, but a firm that helps to solve business problems for the use of technology, ''said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself, he says, is the difference between the market and the market right to create.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or `` big blue, ''as it is due to its logo in the United States familiarly nicknamed - in a hundred years have grown into one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is apparently versatile technology company, is developing the software and hardware infrasturukturu, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from servers for nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">Holding the most patents in U. S. technology companies and five of his employees received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among her accomplishments include the need to withdraw cash, credit card, financial swap, bar code or disk.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year, has become the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, has been overtaken by Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Look forward</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovation is a taste of customers and time - IBM, for example, made a bet on its own operating system, OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or computer IBM PCjr.</seg>
<seg id="33">`` If your business is built on the move forward, you can be emotionally tied to the past, ''poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM has no problem to build the foundations of the many platforms - and when do not work, so as to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="35">In contrast to, say, the rival Microsoft, which in principle it stands or falls on the Windows operating system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Promising technology</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The IBM is the largest share of services, after roughly a fifth of the software and hardware.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yet in 1990, with more than half the strongest advocate hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM has sold a few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period has invested 58 billion dollars to purchase of promising technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the investment continues from 2008, when, for the first time, the world over the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM is in accordance with the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the volume of investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still, it seems that IBM passes through the current crisis.</seg>
<seg id="43">The price of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 increased by rocket 120 percent, net income, the company continuously growing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">IBM 's corporate motto change everything, but its value.</seg>
<seg id="45">Therefore, it can be expected that, even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant it can handle.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="55">IBM, as well as the title, beginning with the production and sale of all the machines for business - from cuts of meat and cheese on the Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years, Watson was in charge of the company, has doubled turnover for the nine million dollars and began to large - scale expansion of firms in all parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson is so valuable that, after almost 40 years in the boss' s chair was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM, work on the development of artificial intelligence, has developed the first programming language.</seg>

<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers, the chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, bought a consultancy firm part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to give advice and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, which in the past three years, IBM 's Smarter Planet paid - the concept, `` smarter planet ''.</seg>
<seg id="64">Its aim is the smart use of technology in the yet to be or unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport or the administration of cities.</seg>

<seg id="1">The development of the prices package since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In 1989, it was in the former Czechoslovakia allowed only five state travel agencies: Michelin, Sporturist, COM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The travel office at the time of the sale in the overwhelming majority of only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists to travel on a vacation to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and in Hungary (Lake Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The notable exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when she was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime turned to the west and the czech tourists in Yugoslavia is very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The great paradox of the socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (i. e. Czechoslovakians) allowed to travel freely individually or in the context of the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the event that the Citizen of Czechoslovakia individually to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, so he needed in this country a letter of invitation from, or the way possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The travel office at the time as offering package tours to the West, but it was the need to queue through the night sleeping bag or be in the `` good friends ''.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even so, however, it was not out of the woods.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so - called international commitment, which was provided for the trip to the West, was awarded the `` politically unreliable people '', which can travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The currency is not freely convertible currency, free of foreign - exchange commitment, so it was not possible to obtain funding (western currency) on the way to the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">By far the most often, however, the Czechs were on vacation in the country, and the result was a large number of cabins and cottages, which the Czechs to procure and this custom survives to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Czechs travel so experienced since 1989, the real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While in 1989, it was a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria our best last year spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The paradox is that you are already aware of, it 's that, for us, is currently the most popular of Croatia was not possible in 1989 to travel freely, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now in the early 1990 's, following the abolition of the visa requirement to neighbouring west european countries, which triggered a huge surge of short - term visits in Vienna, Austria or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">Czechoslovakians, for a long time, can not get enough of the trips to the west, everybody wanted to at least for a second look.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris for tours of the Czechs in parks in tents, since the revenue to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of the travel of the Czechs were in this time of the haul of their own food cans, sausages, etc., to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of the convertible crown, which our tourists could finally after many years destítkách freely to buy western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living, and with it the average salaries, however, rose, prompting around 1997 in another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel beginning to travel regularly from 1997 to prepare the tours of charter flights, which will air travel because of the possibility of contract volume discounts in comparison with the past incredibly cheap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the late 1990 s, had already czechs visa - free travel to virtually all of the world 's advanced countries, in addition to the US, which continue to facilitate our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of post - revolutionary travel was in 2000, when he was due to strong demand of the Czech Republic 's first charter flight to exotic, it was in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">From this year, and each year the world with czech tourists direct flights to warm far countries, this year 's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Exotic country currently visit already around 100 thousand Czechs per year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post - revolutionary development, came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> November 17, 2008, abolished the US visas for czech tourists and that our country has ranked among the most advanced countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in the history of the spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in the history of it spent on a foreign holiday, including the costs of the whereabouts of more than 15 000 per person.</seg>

<seg id="1">The AGM is to find the President again but there is a stalemate</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months is the czech football without the president, and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Jaroslav Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held on Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral system will be followed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without it, they do not begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="5">The result, the czech football have Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hašek resigned from office in June, and upon his retirement urged colleagues to unite and found a strong personality, which would have led to a football game in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the era after Hašek football back to the clashes between the two republics houses, which can not agree on a joint candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And it turned out 16 September, which was to be the new chairman of the selected.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates of the general meeting of the National House in Prague on Smíchově down unnecessarily, since the negotiations remained blocked, and not just the way the elections.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was not a consensus, who has the right to a pile of actually vote - if only the statutory representatives, or even officials the power of attorney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this one point since there was a partial match, which was helped by the recommendations of the Institute for the state and the law, according to which the representation of the mandate is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">Disputes but still there is on the electoral system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Too much clarity on the situation, nor the Executive Committee, which had at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, in essence, nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="14">Look at the choice of several times had changed, but a neuralgic point is still the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to proceed in the 3 rd round, in order to avoid the possibility of stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">`` The dispute is about whether to proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, or to find a different model, ''said one of the three vice - presidents FAČR Dusan Svoboda, who in the leadership of the association representing professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Under the proposed model in the third round of the of the candidates, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, for which he 's running.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is reportedly willing to go to compromise in order to win the candidate who gets more total per cent of votes from both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the czech party advocating a condition that the winner must in the census to get at least a two - thirds majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">`` But it would then become the two previous rounds, it would completely contradicted a bicameral concept, ''he understands the objections of the parties' freedom, according to which would be the best order do not bend and to vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With that, somewhat surprisingly, agrees Thomas Paclík, though, it is estimated that the statutes of the electoral procedure complies with all the candidates most Pelt.</seg>
<seg id="22">`` I wish to have voted for a maximum of the statutes. ''</seg>
<seg id="23">`` In order to make up some of the nonsense as of last week 's meeting, ''said the owner of the Victoria, who stands for the first time and in their statements, is primarily against Pelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelt remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Nymburk, according to him, the new chairman of the unknown, and believe that the candidates together will be in the future work constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">`` All the passions calmed any of today 's procedure for the national team to the World Cup. ''</seg>
<seg id="27">`` Football again will be happy to wave, will be a greater willingness to cooperate, ''says jablonecký deputy, who is from the three largest experience in the management of football as a professional, and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is reticent.</seg>
<seg id="29">`` I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very ambivalent. ''</seg>
<seg id="30">`` It 's not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to assigned to adapt to the legislation. ''</seg>
<seg id="31">`` It may cause it to stop the general meeting again. ''</seg>
<seg id="32">`` I hope, however, that the good sense, ''said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The agreement of all parties have a lot of time left.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some of the negotiations, was supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the contest will be football the generals do not complete.</seg>
<seg id="35">Executive jet, in which they had to move to Podgorica, among other things, the vice - presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, namely from Prague due to a technical malfunction in the morning and was looking for a replacement option, as part of the Executive Committee of the barážové retaliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Finally, it might be a crucial meeting at ministerial level, that can occur in the center.</seg>
<seg id="37">Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to split the party inside the strongest sports associations in the country to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the game, it 's a lot: public subsidies, the credibility of the football and also the forthcoming AGM ČSTV, which will bring a new direction for english sport after the financial problems of the condition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík goes to fight for the President, because there is a suitable candidate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the boss of footballers attractions Thomas Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate, which meets all of his ideas for the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), it would not be in the fight for the top post.</seg>
<seg id="41">`` If the quality of Adept existed, I am fighting for him, and I am not going into the elections. ''</seg>
<seg id="42">`` But in the current situation, no one had failed to find, ''said Stein Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In a battle with Miroslav Pelt and Henry Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Pelt, alleged the champion of the elections, he tried to avoid in the road in front of the FAČR.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also points out that, in the case of his victory in the role of the president he lasted only until 2013, when it 's time for the Annual General Meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In office would probably like to see an experienced and top executive, who is not associated with a football background.</seg>
<seg id="46">`` With some of the people who came into account, I am talking. ''</seg>
<seg id="47">`` For me, it was crazy, but some say that, at the moment, with the czech football do not want to identify. ''</seg>
<seg id="48">`` I wanted to change, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Paclíkovi says he now most of all is Peltovo connection with the president of the CAS regional football association Romano Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes, known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclíka is unacceptable to Pelt stood in the position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">`` If he won, so the sealing the state and not be in football. ''</seg>
<seg id="52">`` In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a businessman, be it football do even more, ''said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Faces that Peltovo name years ago came in tapping in an investigation of corruption, of which, however, Pelt went unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">`` I do not know what the prestige of the football Peltovo victory would bring. ''</seg>
<seg id="55">`` Also, how they looked in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA, ''said Paclík, but they are already taking his statement that he would `` sell Plzeňský club, if Pelt became president.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the event that the Paclík in Thursday 's election triumph, but with Pelt imagine future cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="57">As he and the other candidate Rajchl, which Paclík supported before the September meeting, which ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">`` He (Pelt), was the first I 'd go. ''</seg>
<seg id="59">`` He has a great ability. ''</seg>
<seg id="60">`` I could imagine him to be as head of the team. ''</seg>
<seg id="61">`` But - schedule would drive the association could not. ''</seg>
<seg id="62">`` I also do where I can not do that, ''says Paclík, which attracted a great deal of attention in September that he was behind the Commission of arbitration in the lead with Luďkem Macelou, which replaced the Dagmar Damková.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík claims that the leadership of the Association of chance.</seg>
<seg id="64">Refers to the ability of private firms, since last summer 's in charge also Pilsen, who with his promotion in May to celebrate the opening league triumph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">`` I have to force his way in the football environment changed something to contribute to its particular culture. ''</seg>
<seg id="66">`` To limit the effects of certain interest groups, which should have a tendency to affect the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which is up to the situation, ''says Paclík, who kept his antipathy, for example, to the spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one of the priorities would also considered the cement relations FAČR with czech Olympic Committee, which it for political leaders lobbied for it to be in the sport received more money from the lottery and taxes.</seg>
<seg id="68">`` It is one of the key things that should be the new President. ''</seg>
<seg id="69">`` If there is a tax on gambling, as declared political parties, so I understand their reasoning, but frankly they need to say where the money will go, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">As a burden now Paclík did not take his connection with the Pilsner club, although he says that the President FAČR should be `` bipartisan ''.</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelt is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">`` It 's not ideal. ''</seg>
<seg id="73">`` But I do not see no point in it, to be hypocritical transferring its shares in the `` Club and a year and a half to go back to, ''says Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelt promised new statutes FAČR, which would exclude the election stalemate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that, if elected, to FAČR new statutes, which would in future definitively exclude disputes over the electoral system.</seg>
<seg id="76">Jablonecký functionary is ahead of Thursday 's hearing in Nymburk optimistic and believe that the campaign significantly dampen any success tonight football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelt before September the choice has promised that the right to representation and the acquisition of the Treasury intends to use in the event of the election of focus.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the last election before the General Assembly decided to go at the last minute, and then the two - month suspension could use to his ideas about the governance of football champion and introduced in a broader context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">`` People at all levels of football, they are doing it for a very long time, and they expect that, on Thursday will be the President of the unknown. ''</seg>
<seg id="80">`` He feels that it is high time that the Association of someone, ''says the man who is associated primarily with Jablonec club, but that a number of years in Sparta, the Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="81">I therefore believes that he has enough experience to the czech football to drive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that the current problems with the election 's euphoria, as it was at the time of the Government of Ivan Jaroslav Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">`` Unfortunately, in the June meeting were approved by the rules, which were not so perfect, it was thought. ''</seg>
<seg id="84">`` If it would make it impossible for the different interpretations, President, we have had since September, ''said Pelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Just the most important document the civic association he conceived as a decoy to delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">`` If I become president, I will take it as a personal challenge, and I am willing to give a personal responsibility, if you can not do it. ''</seg>
<seg id="87">`` It 's a matter of principle, without which we can be, ''says Pelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Still, he says, trying to define against their rivals.</seg>
<seg id="89">We previously announced that it can imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchlem, which recognises because of his legal training, and knows that his opponent was its first vice - president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">For a long time, he did not attack or at Thomas Paclíka, who, on the other hand, to Pelt did not let the thread of dry.</seg>
<seg id="91">`` In football is a little over a year, has had some successes. ''</seg>
<seg id="92">`` The attacks were, however, undignified and a lot of people in the election campaign. ''</seg>
<seg id="93">`` And so many of them now has doubts about his true character, ''he said to his opponent 's address Pelt, who says he remains faithful to proclamations, which announced in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His strongest weapon is in his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions until after the entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="95">This should be a showcase of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">`` And I also tried to put an end to all of the affair from the case of Bohemians or the aftermath of last year 's corruption scandal. ''</seg>
<seg id="97">`` Then I went to a meeting with the private and public sectors, to ensure enough money for the whole game, ''said Stein a candidate two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">It also promised that his approach to the head of football is no personnel purges.</seg>
<seg id="99">`` I would have had to be the first to meet the individual employees, ''said the Strahov, where the long interregnum, there is an understandable anxiety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the current disaster scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming general meeting, believes that Thursday 's delegates to Nymburk unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="101">`` If it is the only issue, how they will vote in the third round, so that you can get. ''</seg>
<seg id="102">`` Football needs credibility, and that will only be finally back their leader, ''remains Pelt two days before possibly decisive day of his career funkcionářské optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that he FAČR began to work hard</seg>

<seg id="133">Instead, he gives the complicity that force pulling together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While the Pelt says it is `` disqualified from the back of the czech football confidence '', the other contender Paclíka is considered a strong candidate that football has to offer.</seg>
<seg id="135">`` No one can dispute that, in Pilsen in the year I did a wonderful job. ''</seg>
<seg id="136">`` If he was elected, so perhaps he continued in those cases, which started the Ivan Hašek and not fundamentally change of personnel in the Commission. ''</seg>

<seg id="12">The sport was not overdoing it, says Meder - only in the water, it 's something else.</seg>
<seg id="13">The anger is just that fans of swimming must content itself with the blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the runners for health can be inhaled the fragrance of spruce forests or listening to the chatter of birds in the park.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">The story of the architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: the austrian pavilion at the World Expo in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became the museum in Vienna, stood empty and ruin.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is now open again as the exhibition of the house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When the all - out for the modern postwar architecture, for obvious forms, a glass lobby, bold strokes and new construction materials, which are typical of belief in technological progress, then it is the austrian pavilion architect Charles Schwanzera for the Brussels World 's Fair 1958 concise and illustrious example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzerův Pavilion received at the Grand Prix d 'Architecture for his mild and vznosně operating structure of steel and glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction is still seen as a milestone of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Famous architect, also for the next World Expo pavilion built of Austria.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary four - cylinder BMW - plus the palace as the key carried out by building in Munich, 1973 internationally famous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">His as a temporary exhibition building designed pavilion at the World 's Fair in Schweizer Garten in Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), and in 1962, opened the Museum of the 20 th century - was named as the `` house of the 20 th century ''.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the building was not appropriate for the museum, or geographic or technically - were missing from the walls for the suspension of art exhibits, no satisfactory climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yet it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna of the new stand.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and dilapidated more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion, is now the name `` 21 st century ''and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday evening there will open the Belvedere museum, which includes the Palace, the first exhibition - happy intention in every respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Setting up a new start Agnes Husslein - Arco, which became the new head of the austrian Galerie Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein - Arco, across an art historian with a prominent career, M. J. in youth skater, later at Sotheby 's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, pushed strongly for the reconstruction of the politicians and preservationists, with public funds and private sponsorship money and a recovery.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to the contemporary art should not be subject to the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby the foundations, should there be a cafe and bookstore, and had to be built from the office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision, low - budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The implementation was then Krischanitz ideally cast.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only that, sensitively restored and expanded the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna, and he won the competition, but because, in Schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him `` extremely important '', `` almost every weekend'' at the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew of the project and also about the problems of the building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change of use of the lost for their generosity and lightness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reconstruction were far more problems: the building was `` the trap for energy, ''says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">Profiles of window glass facades were exchanged, used glass fibre reinforced with insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Chladové bridges - steel beams were strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos completed ceilings rescued.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two underground floor space for new uses, recessed lighting channel between the building and the street - lighting, to the entrance leads the bridge - almost a new building, but still lift Schwanzerův pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original front door were maintained, the building is painted in the old anticorrosion reddish color tone.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the screen is even more exactly the same as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all of this by English Heritage Authority and a low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">`` Often had to be found material, which is a good, cheap and also liked the Antiquities Authority '', says Krischanitz and notes on the floor of the basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, and the problems of the reconstruction was building a flexible and airy.</seg>
<seg id="33">He said that it was difficult to the pavilion, `` who came here from Brussels, ''he said recently Krischanitz, a typical `` drop - in - the - City - history''.</seg>
<seg id="34">Such architecture was said to be `` always in the wrong place ''and still wants to `` wake up the appropriate self - confidence''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, but it 's not the 21 st century on, as happened to the happy coincidence: in a circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely new design `` urban neighborhood near the main train station' s office and residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="36">And yet there is a different circumstance: the 21 st century could receive support from other Krischanitzovy buildings, as the lover of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and how it is heard, it is with the city for the neighborhood to the post in the Schweizer Garten.</seg>

<seg id="7">That in Germany there is xenophobia about it yet, there was never any doubt.</seg>
<seg id="8">The right wing extremist network, however, range, which long ago can not see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">`` To come back to life again bloody ideology? ''read the headline of Internet edition of the turkish newspaper Haberturk. ``''</seg>

<seg id="14">As a rebuke to operate here coverage of several turkish media: `` a gift of Germany to now ''is the title of the article in the turkish online platform `` Haber x'', which reports on the background of the series.</seg>

<seg id="19">Why did the german authorities have much earlier, after a suspicious looking in the right wing extremist circles, the authors.</seg>

<seg id="24">Photos of the burning in Solingen is deeply etched in the memory of the Germans and Turks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since no other event showed up here the Turks living more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans, distrust and an interval may result in the right - wing violence</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Scandalous Bank in Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Yet the Bank of Europe does not have a seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">UBS has suffered in the financial crisis almost went bankrupt, and since then glide from one crisis to another.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it has a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So the Axel Weber certainly think so.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his noisy departure from his leadership of the Federal Bank happened in July known that taking 2013 to almost as spectacular new job: President of the Management Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS - and lucrative career move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber, the forward publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired the solidity and said the remarks towards future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">`` Die UBS had a turnover. ''</seg>
<seg id="9">`` I look forward to working with Kaspar Villigerem and Oswald Grübelem ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September, it was clear that everything will turn out differently.</seg>
<seg id="11">One dealer from UBS in London went all the safety systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros wasted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The board of directors of UBS, Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, the respected banker, he had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">The president of the board of UBS has since also stunned - and they all ask: where does Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It became known that Mr Weber bank since February 2012 may advise.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Presidency of the Council and the government takes over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber that will be hard.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker, a professor of economics, and the issuance of a banker, would have time to incorporate the needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Once he takes over responsibility for the bank 's strategy, which was once again proved that deserves the title of `` the bank' s biggest scandals in Europe '</seg>
<seg id="19">As UBS 's, on the other hand, a great - until recently was the largest asset manager in the world - and sliding, on the other hand, had for years from one scandal to another.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, is proud of the swiss bank spared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It began in the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the silent, and a solid, but also a trustee combines with the ambitious objectives: I also mean something in investment banking.</seg>
<seg id="24">So managed by UBS 2007, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And, on the other hand, refer to it as the investment bank in the league of the world 's largest banks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">It made an impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker and a longtime professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger says: `` my students at UBS, always as a model of good banks. ''</seg>
<seg id="28">`` From today 's perspective, people ask: how I could be so wrong? ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, for the first time, it was clear that something has gone wrong at UBS.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year has resigned, surprisingly, the boss of the Board of directors Peter Wuffli, who has not been seen as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, I do not know why he left.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment bank division has wasted subprime - Papíry and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To that end, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of really 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">But actually find investors, but such, recently had her: opaque asian state fund from Singapore and an arab state fund, which was so discreet that you do not know his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But it was only the first crash.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to admit new billions in losses, the President of the Management Board of Marcel Ospel, 2006 is still the second best - paid directors of Switzerland, has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008 there was a disaster: UBS was due to bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse, and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatorily convertible bonds, which could become a co - owner of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Throughout the whole of Switzerland was shaken - because, as it is dramatic for a small country, as he has on its territory, so the big banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">After all, the balance - sheet UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture).</seg>
<seg id="43">`` Once again we could not save UBS '', says banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The disaster is the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last few months, it has surrendered UBS in a tax dispute with America and its willingness to the issue of data of wealthy clients who, as far as possible, with the help of the banks passed the tax.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, she agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as the return of the profits from these transactions, including the parking charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It has been subjected to UBS more or less openly that helped by cutting taxes.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time, lost something that has always been its capital in the competition for the rich clients: a halo of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After this scandal has already been the swiss bank secrecy that, as before.</seg>
<seg id="50">There followed the resignation of Chairman and President of the Management Board.</seg>
<seg id="51">And an exodus of customers' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So the bank lost in the course of a few months, his credibility in the central business areas: in the investment banking because of poor speculation and property management for helping to reduce taxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when it was again a little comfort, just as it was thought that UBS is once again, here comes this unfortunate commercial quest: one dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank saw that something is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking it probably still is not working.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">`` A case that Adoboli had revealed that the control of risk has changed too little, ''says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Finanz bank of the Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also, the financial director of the big german banks is certain: `` the problem of UBS is that they can not control the risks. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was not exactly the idea of caution with which the swiss bankers started a long time ago, to become the capital of the world: not too much of a risk, but the safety for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic collapsed again the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">The swiss banks have become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high - quality chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The headquarters of UBS in Zurich is more suited to a good swiss private bank - it 's just a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now the position is a classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the lake, which is backed by the swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are beautiful, lettings business is one of the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Jewelers like Tiffany 's was found between the swiss traditional business as an ice cream parlor Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">Already, over the centuries, it is the swiss banks: from the Nationalbank over Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the lobby, UBS will enter the heavy the revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside the walls are lined in marble, a large leather chairs, in addition to the logos of the bank 's big direction for `` safe ''.</seg>
<seg id="67">UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss Bank both swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - suppressed or betrayed, as is the boss of one small swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name would prefer not to read in the papers, he concluded, as all of the swiss bankers, also with both velkobankami shops.</seg>
<seg id="70">UBS is probably too grown, notes - particularly in investment banking, where he also expanded the Anglo - Saxon.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss, they do not have anything to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">`` And if not, they adapted to long Anglo - Saxon ways. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed, it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, which UBS has changed, gave her first high profits and then disaster: no european financial institution had not lost in the jungle around subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">October 15, 2008 was a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="75">`` In the center of a government coalition of small sedmimilionové country on the rescue operation in the history of the nation '', says the author Lukas Hässig in his book `` Der UBS - Crash''.</seg>
<seg id="76">To 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euro accepted by politicians to rescue from bankruptcy standing velkobanku.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If the talks with the swiss bankers, so you can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three swiss velkobank within the group.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bank, which is already on the merger was too big for a small Switzerland - and still continue to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">It helped that the two different bank predecessor UBS complement: a rich, but sleepy bank in Zurich in the management of the property and the poorer, but internationally strongly involved.</seg>
<seg id="82">Then came an internationalized investment bankers for many of the money with which to spin the roulette wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">With the rise of UBS are linked by two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group, UBS and Marcel Ospel, the chairman of the board.</seg>
<seg id="84">`` I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel 's team of the future, ''says banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">`` Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about the models and statistics and Ospel, managing the feelings around the stomach, who is from the bank of science has completely up. ''</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel, he says, to the end of the counting on Wuffliho.</seg>
<seg id="87">And Wuffli was at the end of the likely to have done a crucial error: `` I think he thought that his models are a reality, ''says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">`` This is a tragic case. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: pride.</seg>
<seg id="91">UBS employees are clearly remember the meetings managers, on which the group chief Wuffli repeated again and again the same password: knock Goldman Sachs from the throne.</seg>
<seg id="92">Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">`` The League Tables '', the waiting list, which documents the success of the banks of the time.</seg>
<seg id="94">In trying to UBS on the location of the very top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">A few steps away, she has succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="96">In a trade with the foreign exchange and stock participated in the games at the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">Corporate advisers who were responsible, but underline one weakness: interest in international trade, in the language of the bankers' `` Fixed Income '', I think there is a big gap for the largest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">UBS has some gaps in the U. S. mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To this gap has been closed, the UBS to adventure, which it almost cost the existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, investment as the bank itself and her based fund to ensure the risks to the U. S. subprime investments.</seg>
<seg id="101">Developed in the engine, securities diaper on America 's mortgage loans and to - yet, but also by leaving the risk.</seg>
<seg id="102">Still, when other banks have long sought a way out.</seg>
<seg id="103">`` Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS buying, ''says banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">How big is the euphoria, so deep in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">One manager, had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than was thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">The position at UBS became an ejection seat and into today 's sway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Who leads velkobanku now has almost unmanageable work.</seg>
<seg id="108">They must find a strategy for the bank, which all the close of business models.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banking expert Geiger has had an idea: the end of the investment banking, the concentration of wealth management, a return to the roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">Not so far, the Bank did not (yet) does not want to go.</seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment banking industry has severely cut, so much is now clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">The next Thursday to the new head of the Bank 's Sergio Ermotti imagine the world their future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">The 51 - year - old swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, as the bank surprisingly broke up with her predecessor Grübelem.</seg>
<seg id="114">In the meantime, he: for long - term business, UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants the investment bank noted back to the state in the mid - 1990 s.</seg>
<seg id="116">3500 posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But it will not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is she?</seg>
<seg id="120">What he wants to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">It is a question that Axel Weber has by now.</seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly, but still says only that he and his wife, the first found in Zurich apartment.</seg>
<seg id="123">The next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The massacre at a personal level</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">An emotionally powerful new book, Peter Englund, the beauty and the sorrow: non - history of the First World War (the beauty and the Sorrow: an Intimate history of the First World War) begins as a long list of prominent figures, it will make your head spin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">One of the Council, as he maintained: carefully this page and make a bookmark.</seg>
<seg id="4">With all the people in the story of Mr Englund very well, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a beacon - in the moments when, as well as the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Mr Englund 's swedish historian and journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is also the new deputy to the Swedish Academy, which grants awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">The book, which is fun, it 's a very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite correctly pointed, as `` an anti - historical work ''.</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains a number of well - known names, major contracts or famous battles, in contrast to her almost missing the ambassadors, energetic, journalists, and the debate about tactics and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as `` a book about what it was ''is mainly about ``. feelings, impressions, experiences and moods''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">`` The beauty and grief ''in the combination of war experiences 20 more or less common men and women, on both sides of the barricades, from students and botanists until after the climbers, doctors, the driver 's emergency vehicles and officials.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others become prisoners of war, they lose limbs, or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives are flaring as flames blazing in church - new is added to a patchwork of fates, while others died.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book Mr Englund, from conventional historical novels is different.</seg>
<seg id="15">The idea that the first world war was only a horrific trench fighting on the Western Front.</seg>
<seg id="16">`` The beauty and grief ''deftly explores other places, where there was a war drama: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soldiers in this book deals with problems with the fall of bee nests, must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or are faced with the presence of the tsetse flies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Almost from the beginning to the very touching reading.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war in the lives of people like a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina, stinking of gunpowder.</seg>
<seg id="20">When, in the distance, the firing of guns and you are a woman who is at home with their children, or stay?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who 's coming?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one did not understand what was going on, even in this, why was the war.</seg>
<seg id="23">`` The vacuum arising from the lack of facts, ''Mr Englund, `` was filled with speculation, the hopes, fears and prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares and rumors.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">`` The beauty and grief ''follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmboroughová, an english nurse in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, the young sailor serving in the german fleet.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are all taken from curricula, letters and other already published materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Descriptions of their lives may sound scary and fascinating, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are absolutely living and believable.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of these deals with the suffering and dealing with him.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the story of a german student author says: `` substitutes, everywhere the substitutes. ''</seg>
<seg id="29">`` Coffee substitute, imitation of aluminium, imitation crepe paper, bandages, wooden knobs. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Going further, describes the substitutes for food in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">He mentions `` meat made from compressed rice cooked in a sheep fat (and accompanied by a bone of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato skins, boots with wooden soles ''.</seg>
<seg id="32">It argues that there was a `` 837 registered substitutes meat in the production of the hot dogs and 511 registered substitutes coffee ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some of the stories are about honour and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">One American in the internal incentives for violence and brutality, and then the war declared: `` in the end, you will understand that, because that 's human nature, not sitting in a comfortable chair with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening newspapers or a good book and pretend that this is a mask of civilization, and that is for the stiffly in me is not a barbarian. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a british soldier is aware that, with the greatest likelihood of death and no one would notice, let alone to mourn.</seg>
<seg id="36">`` When you finally accepted that he would, at least, that it happens in front of a grateful audience, ''he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, however, seems like a `` man who secretly hanged. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other remarks concerning the retirement of the old Europe and the advent of new horrors.</seg>
<seg id="39">`` The conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competition, ''says Mr Englund, `` the war between factories.''</seg>
<seg id="40">He caught it, what he calls a `` new kind of the new century, articulate and an ideological foe of a serial killer in the clothes of who their bloodshed carried out without getting up from the table. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The people were quite unexpectedly, the villainous alternates with heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Englund describes the soldiers, who is from prostitutes deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease, in order to avoid the service at the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">`` Grotesque example of this behavior was trading gonokokovým pus, that the soldiers were buying and plastered with his genitals, in the hope that you will end up in the hospital, ''he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">`` The most desperate it rubbed into his eyes, which is often come to the end of my life. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the Swedish from Peter Graves' s prose Mr Englund swing, but not spectacular, which, to his human subject admirably.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small outputs captures the way in which the war `` a totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred ''.</seg>
<seg id="47">People are beginning to ask, why is their leaders to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books of the First World War, mostly rather than with a complex story worked with hints of, for example, `` the First World War and the modern memories ''from Paul Fussella or novels like `` all Quiet on the Western Front'' from Erich Maria Remarquea.</seg>
<seg id="49">Mr Englund prefers the conventional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book has the most overwhelming conclusion, which in popular literature is unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="51">I told him.</seg>
<seg id="52">You will, however, seems to be, it was as if the author of books, you page of a list of heroes from his hand and lit it.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The city 's leaders this charge flatly refused.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a meeting of the City Council, which was held last month, said the education minister Dennis M. Walcott, that the release was part of the budget approved in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the members of the Council immediately countered that, in the budget is not specifically mentioned on the release of the support staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Leaders of the city of District Council 37, announced that they have already made the necessary documents and warned of the Ministry of Education, that it will sue. in the middle of a press conference, where formally notified of the action in a state court in Manhattan.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city, said that the city still claim, and therefore to the indictment will express.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to the complaint, which was obtained by the New York Times, the unions have focused on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, which wants to support its claims about the injustices of the negotiations. he had the view that the poor school more assistants, because they are already denied sufficient financial resources.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">They point out that while in schools in parts of Staten Island, the layoffs at all, and in parts of the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in a part of the District 23 in Brownsville came on the work of the 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was released even 46 assistants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Recalls that in school, Public School 36 in Harlem lost the work of five of the eight assistants, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of students live in poverty in the lawsuit says: `` it 's not a neighborhood full of parents who can provide funds to cover the deficit in the budget. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The budget of the School of Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent and the school also lost money, when the city changed the way of calculating the bonus of finance for the poor student.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the document was to describe the actions of the use of the word `` excess '', i. e., to abolish the position, although this word is more often used to describe the removal of teachers on the payroll of the school to a database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority.</seg>

<seg id="3">Before that, however, must have the revolution to succeed, for a long time, the reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the units of the United States closed.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The sentence may seem innocuous, but no debate on Libya, and has not been easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">During the summer, lawmakers from both parties that even with the White House on the wording of a statement for approval or rejection of the military, the role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain resolution authorizing the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.</seg>

<seg id="11">However, the same day, when he was in the House rejected the proposal, the House rejected the measure, which would stop the funding of U. S. operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">The U. S. mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress has criticised the way in which President Obama mission control, but its members apparently unafraid of so much to him in his actions stopped support.</seg>

<seg id="25">Goodlattův proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were introduced in Congress and a wide variety of topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and Senate - and others are only slight variations of the other.</seg>
<seg id="27">Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of a balanced budget amendment and a handful of others who would like to `` regulate federal spending ''.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the proposals are not the same, but their supporters - particularly from Republicans, who want to improve the reputation - can boast of their `` author ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, would require the addition of a balanced budget vote, the House and the Senate.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In addition to the budget he wants a few members of the discussion of the limitations of the period in which the members of Congress to serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N. Y.) wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the office of the president.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">`` All of them were introduced as some orphans, ''the officer wrote in an e - mail.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am sure that the organizers meant well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I know that, yes.</seg>
<seg id="11">But what I saw was not respect. it was a pity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">So completely the opposite impression only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the american public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The army 's bezbřeze included praise for his victims.</seg>

<seg id="16">`` We are not victims, ''said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="17">`` But it seems that the only way we can do some support, is to put us in the role of the unfortunate souls. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This issue is very sensitive for the military commanders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or a public relations, which we need.</seg>
<seg id="19">They also recognise that anger, with troops returning once from Vietnam, was much worse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The result is that most of the words of regret is spoken quietly and privately among veterans of the war.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the two sons of the retired Colonel Mark Canciana returning from combat, where they served as a member of the Marine Corps, warned of their father, the service will be people outside the military look from two angles.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Army is facing growing pressure to crack down on the use of rape</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week to decide whether will begin the process of 28 men and women against the army because of an alleged failure in the case of rape.</seg>
<seg id="3">If not, they are prepared to bring the action of the hundreds of other applicants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was in the night, when she was allegedly raped by her colleague from the Army, 25 years and was in the 11 th week of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="5">It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks on Air Station Miramar, north of San Diego. after dinner with a friend on their male colleagues, carrying a box of 12 beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Asked if he could join them, that would be in her room for a drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">`` In my head, a warning light, ''she described Lymanová.</seg>
<seg id="8">But a native Texan her objections were ignored.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: no, he 's 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">`` He 's from Texas, ''she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">`` I wish I listened to my instincts. ''</seg>
<seg id="12">Claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked, threw her on the bed and raped her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, 18 November, will be Lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military to wait for the verdict of the hearing, which could have a historic impact. it will be happening in Arlington, Virginia, and it is about whether the allegations against a former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, he will have to appear in court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld had failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The accusation was in February, a Washington lawyer, Susan Burke and the plaintiff had 17 members. over the coming months, however, the number has grown to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all say they have been raped or otherwise sexually attacked by his colleagues in the army, and the army after the announcement of the weft of failed in the investigation, the punishment of any pursuit of justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says that going after a senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts right for them.</seg>
<seg id="17">`` The army is obligatory system, ''he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">`` Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the introduction of measures against such action? the chain of command. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also alleges that from February contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could become part of a further action in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">Her strategy: rather than to group all the charges in this case - put all its eggs in one basket, as she said - to bring in a number of different cases, if need be, to pressure eased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A team of defending the Defense Ministry leads the Attorney General of the United States Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues gave rise to the dismissal of the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Court documents obtained by Newsweek, discuss the strategy of the defence - in essence, that current or former soldiers, the army can not sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the regulation of the Supreme Court of the 1950 s called as the Feres Doctrine is not the federal government responsible for the injuries sustained by soldiers on active duty.</seg>
<seg id="24">`` The alleged injuries related to the military service of the plaintiffs, ''the document says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Ministry of Defence is on this matter has refused to comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, things have changed since the 1950 s.</seg>
<seg id="27">Although women still officially may not serve in the fight, it 's just a quibble: in modern wars, hard to find the right of the front line.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams of female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women in a war zone.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between the wars fell 150 soldiers of the female sex - two - thirds of them directly in the fight.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time to the modernisation and the military, explains Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In their struggle is not alone in addition to her are dealing with the case of three other legal representatives.</seg>
<seg id="32">In law school Yale drawn visitors - a seminar on legal action on four main military academy for the development of the atmosphere of promoting hatred for women.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regardless of the non - profit organization of America Vietnam veterans gathering evidence for its claim headed against the army. this action is in line with the diagnosis of a `` personality disorder '', which was allegedly found in the victim of rape, in order to have the military an excuse for their release, according to activists, such as anal Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women 's Action Network, a perfectly normal practice.</seg>
<seg id="34">The group already in December brought an action against the organisation for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for assistance from people who said they were in the service of a sexually attacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In Congress launched nine separate proposals, a group of senators and members of both political parties and suggested in a number of corrective measures.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the Office for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence of the Ministry of Defence was in the year 2010 reported 3,158 sexual assaults.</seg>
<seg id="37">This type of attacks remains, however, in most cases, unannounced and, according to its own estimates of the Pentagon this number represents approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a report issued in March is dismantled and the intensity of the prosecution of the suspects: in 2010 to get 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half as opposed to the civilian criminal justice system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Burke described the attacks as the first of a series of trauma.</seg>
<seg id="40">Private First Class Lymanová, for example, reported the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was made.</seg>
<seg id="41">During the night, he says, was asked for details about his rape said 11 times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">Have all the necessary tests to determine the rape and in her bed was found in the blood of the attacker - from the wound, which made him on the arm.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, has completed Lymanová hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions on whether that on the day of the attack she loved with his friend.</seg>
<seg id="44">The six people, as witnesses to the reputation to account for the benefit of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">`` I remember the day when he was a judgment, ''says Lymanová.</seg>
<seg id="46">`` I had the feeling that, right there on the spot to - screaming, I ran out of the courtroom. ''</seg>
<seg id="47">`` Put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I am his commanding officer said: it was not his court. my. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman told to attend a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed personality disorder, which she described as unfit for duty.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010 was from the army without honor, and therefore not entitled to earn released.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whatever the case, the Lymans and others sought to move on to the next phase or not, it 's a marathon, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law.</seg>
<seg id="51">But, notes, `` from my point of view, they should be able to go to the next phase of the trial. ''</seg>
<seg id="52">Between them and the verdict, however, is the doctrine, which was criticized by from the moment she saw the light of day.</seg>
<seg id="53">I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is a few decades behind, because of their obligations to comply with the same degree of motivational incentives and deterrent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Adds: `` the odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try it. ''</seg>
<seg id="56">The change occurs only when good people willing to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">In the hearing decided in their favour, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Burkevoá, collected hundreds of other people prepared to take action and to work on other causes of this topic.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: how will the scientists examined on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik has become the new face of right - wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man, who his anti - immigrant views presented on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday the Braivik, who confessed to the killing rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite Breivik could act alone, in cyberspace, certainly was not alone: during the attack, he spent a lot of time in front of the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists in support of the right - wing groups on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the scientists want to know more of these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how to find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easily - just go on Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">`` We realized we get is, is not that hard, ''says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report of the british research team, which involved the European Digital populism.</seg>
<seg id="9">Supply of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists were enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the site, and with absolute precision to determine the demographic group - something that marketers are doing it for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartlett 's team across Europe found half a million fans of the right - wing groups, and then to focus attention and sent them ads. however, instead of their through to the newly established group or a kind of diet products, urged them to fill out a questionnaire in which there were questions about their level of education, the violence and optimism due to their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 supporters of 14 different right - wing groups in 11 european countries - without it, so he had to leave office.</seg>
<seg id="12">`` It 's a whole new way of conducting research, ''notes Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not all that surprising: online followers of right - wing groups are mostly young men, which became an increasing level of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But on the other hand, `` those who its online activism combined with off - line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The team 's work DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes the new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research teams, medical scientists and researchers use the site to study everything from health problems and the social trends hiding under a status update, contributions to the walls and down `` like me ''.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Facebook report more than 800 million active users. - each of them a day on average, with three different data, from the social network 's literally `` information supernova '', which is behind the development of many of the new research. number of academic work, in whose name is the word on Facebook, increased compared to the state five years ago to nearly 800%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some scientists is the magic of Facebook, in that it gives them a chance to study people without having to bother somewhere on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">`` Before, if you wanted to carry out a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them. ''</seg>
<seg id="20">`` You have to get to the parties, where would you but never allowed ''says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">`` All this Facebook degrades - you just go directly to them. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others argue that the site will be able to offer a way to identify the socio - health problem and avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that college students, most of his drunken outputs on Facebook, they were much more at risk of the problem of alcohol abuse than students who, on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno, proposed to fellow students websites monitored and come up with the offer of help student who is too much of a status.</seg>
<seg id="25">`` The problem can not be resolved, if it can not diagnose, ''said the Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, a co - author Dr. Moreno, director of the Center for Health, behaviour and development of children at the Children 's Research Institute in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="26">`` We have found a way to identify at - risk children who would otherwise not have had a chance to occur. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook itself constantly probed the data of its users.</seg>
<seg id="28">The information the team drew up the statistics on the context of relational statuses and on St. Valentine 's Day, turnout in 2010 and the satisfaction of the nation (mainly using the information to which they had access - advocates of Internet freedom have long claimed that the site had a treasure trove of information available for research and others).</seg>
<seg id="29">But users of Facebook, they know that the page is watching, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend of mine, which is thousands of miles away, is the need to provide the site of your personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if the users of Facebook will become part of the research, which do not even know?</seg>
<seg id="31">Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off - line, on - line data, however, are available to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="32">`` To me, the most users do not even think that scientists can peer into their profiles, ''says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, carried out by using public Facebook wall of its students.</seg>
<seg id="33">`` As for them, so that the information is only between them and their friends. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Consequently, it is also considered the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">I research in the off - line, there is no guarantee that the body is completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">Facebook 's can not verify, of how much of the information on the profile and contributions to the truth.</seg>
<seg id="37">`` What you are saying on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, they are two completely separate things, ''explains Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That 's why Selwin, who spent long years of research into new technologies, thinks that a pencil and notebook, and continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in the research.</seg>
<seg id="39">`` When you go into the real world and talk to real people, this is something that can not be replaced, ''he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">`` Social research should be on society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on off - line. ''</seg>

<seg id="1">7 the lessons of the lost interview with Steve Jobs in the movie in cinemas this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">When Steve Jobs 5 October died, began to appear the views of the people who have compared with Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius, the largest modern inventor.</seg>
<seg id="3">The recently rediscovered Jobsově interview, which was convenience for the film, which was released this week, it will be for all fans of Apple 's, the fact that his creative mind completely understand the business processes and work flows behind its products.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was a wonderful designer, idealistic and self - appointed member of the hippie, but at the same time also pedantic organizer and man that every little thing goes into great detail - believed that many entrepreneurs are suffering from `` the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between good and excellent the end product is still a long way to go and work. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, he worked Bob Cringely on tv the triumph of the computer, which dealt with the dawn of personal computing. during the filming took place in a unique, more than an hour - long conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">This time it is ten years since he was forced to leave the company Jobs of Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, and looking as broad public acceptance of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the tv show was eventually used only a part of the entire Cringelyho conversation and about the original copies of the interview was said that was lost in transit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after Jobsově death, however, were found in the VHS copies of the director 's garage.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is this material, slightly clipped, forms the basis of the 68 minutes picture Steve Jobs: the Lost Interview, who is headed to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who was known for his distaste for the provision of a long conversation, Jobs is surprisingly enthusiastic, that may be talking about his philosophy of technological and commercial strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also shows a very thoughtful man.</seg>
<seg id="12">Four times in the course of the conversation, between a question and answer a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, which is seen as Jobs answer perfectly still, that was a short and precise.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when, on the surface of the sails Jobsův perfectionism, when Cringelyho issues are impatient and encouraged him to get to the problems and issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The interview was filmed before the days of Pixaru, iPod or 'and appear in it eerily prophetic thoughts, when Jobs assesses, what does the rest of the company' s good and bad, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to study a posthumous evaluation Jobsovy career, but on Jobs, seen here as an earnest dreamer in the prime of his genius, is something raw and inspirational.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have my own vision of how the case could and should look like.</seg>
<seg id="17">It did not take long, and after his thoughts, he is also began to put into practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of the seven scenes of the interview, which is worth noting:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">How he learned to drive the company:</seg>
<seg id="20">`` Over the years, I have always asked: `` why are you doing this? 'and the answer was always the same: well, that' s the way it is. ''</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he 's doing what he' s doing, never on matters relating to the business does not think in depth.</seg>
<seg id="22">I found that out.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs says that describes his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was confused by the way they were recorded costs - often began reading `` standard costs '', on their levels could only speculate. at that moment, decided to go their own way - developed an instrument that would guarantee that they could trade costs to determine within seconds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">How did the mischief on the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs remembers the `` blue box '', which was built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allows people to hack into the phone company and free phone anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">The device that was written in the past have gone, but Jobsovo enthusiasm, when the blue box describes as an instrument of power, is literally contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">It tells how with Wozniak device tested using a pay phone and during the conversation, he left the transfer from one network AT &amp; T to another, while with the largest number of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="29">`` At least half a dozen times we are like that - around the world, so when we then something called the pay phone, there was not a minute later on the phone at the door, ''laughs Jobs.</seg>
<seg id="30">`` We were young and we found ourselves, we can build a case, which is capable of running the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world. ''</seg>
<seg id="31">The two of them have made a little thing that could control the much larger giant - it was an incredible experience and I would not exist without her Apple.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs is a description of a joke with Wozniak almost to the end. through the blue box in the middle of the night was summoned to the Vatican and to talk to the pope, as well as Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">I called on the status of the members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to talk with the U. S. diplomat, and it was not until just before the phone woke up and the Pope himself, with a pair of laughter and put the phone down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As he fell in love with technology (and was on the phone with Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">When he was 12, and has been looking for spare parts to build Power, found in the number of Bill Hewlett and called him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Not long after their 20 - minute interview was Jobs secured summer jobs in the company of Hewlett - Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">`` `` Incredibly has affected me. it was the only company, which at that time was recognized, and shaped my view of what the company is and how to treat their staff. ''</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the employees at HP, who visited the company 's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw `` the first desktop computer, which was ever produced ''.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the size of a suitcase, CRT monitor and I fell in love with it at once.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a teenager I in HP moved higher and higher, hanging around the computer and began to write programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What makes innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">In a few places, Jobs during the conversation he speaks about how to invent new products on the run.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the early days of his career, when he started to sell a printed circuit boards, one customer said that for him by a computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">He had only paid 30 days, during which he had to invent, complete and deliver the cash facility.</seg>
<seg id="45">When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in the development of the computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">`` I remember, we were quite fiercely fought... shouting at me, that it would take five years [a mouse, which would cost USD 300], when I got tired, I went out and found a designer. ''</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we were able to make perfectly reliable Mouse for $15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">How big companies out of breath:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs has predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision would falter and lose their share of the market.</seg>
<seg id="50">`` Let 's just say that you are working for IBM or Xerox, so you are doing better copiers and printers, and what' s next? ''</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you have a monopoly on the market, so that the company had the company could not be more successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">At the moment it is ruled by a sales and marketing, so that firms run by people who are in charge of this, as the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision - making process.</seg>
<seg id="53">Technological genius, who led the company to its solid position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about the good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge is essential.</seg>
<seg id="54">That 's exactly what happened in the company of Xerox.</seg>
<seg id="55">The company Xerox could own virtually the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It could be ten times bigger than it is, could be the Microsoft of the 1990 s.</seg>
<seg id="57">The victory, however, to create a defeat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">As he takes innovation as an art form:</seg>
<seg id="59">`` Between good and excellent the end product is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and how the great idea develops, it will be changing and growing. ''</seg>
<seg id="60">During that time, she will learn a lot.</seg>
<seg id="61">You have to go to a number of compromises - some things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories do not make.</seg>
<seg id="62">You have to remember always 5 000 things - different concepts - and put them together...</seg>
<seg id="63">Finally, is a matter of taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and, in a way, he 's trying to reflect on what they are doing.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">I have never been ashamed of it, it 's a good idea to steal.</seg>
<seg id="66">The company Macintosh was so amazing, and successful, therefore, that the people who worked in it, they were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and it happened at the same time as the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">If it had not been for computers and new technology could be amazing things in different sectors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case in court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day when the Supreme Court held behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question of whether to accept the challenge to the law on health care, President Obama 's two of the justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be before the court to take part in the negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine justices gathered to discuss the submitted proposals.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the direct experience of cases, the action was brought by 26 states are questioning the radical overhaul of health care, which last year approved by Congress - the law, which mobilized the conservative activists around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed that action heard. in March is expected to 5, 5 - hour meeting, the outcome of which, moreover, even more agitated presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at the time of the decision will be in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A lawyer who will stand up to the Court and will seek to achieve a rejection of the bill, will most likely Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under the leadership of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clementova law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies, which helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has long years in defense of conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company, which has sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade association calling the law, known as the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of a stake in the huge financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held in a Washington hotel for several hours after the debate on the topic of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="11">He attended, in addition to the other, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and confirmed the law on health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">And the marketing of the guests? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is nothing new: this pair of judges to the Federalist Society attended for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And certainly not to do anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the judges released from the obligation to comply with the code of conduct, which are subject to lower the federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If not, it would be their behaviour was subject to the principle of C 4, which says that `` the judge may participate in events that are related and other organisations are taking in order to obtain funds, however, the judge may not be the speaker, a guest of honour, or may not be appearing on the programme of action. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two law firms - acting in the case, and also the company with a huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to alerted activists calling for ethics in government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">`` This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of some of the judges that the Supreme Court is under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges, ''said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">`` The judges were drinking and had dinner at a social lunch together with the legal representatives, who are waiting to be tried in a court of law. ''</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and assistance in obtaining funding through this action undermines his feet all allegations of bias, which is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas against his critics have shown little understanding and told them that they also without problems combining their legal obligations with those groups, such as the Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thomas' s wife, Ginni is a conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly of Justice Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan has worked as the Attorney General for the government of President Obama, when he appeared before the court of the first protests against the law.</seg>
<seg id="25">Critics of the Kagan to push him to waive the participation of the case, and says that, at the time for the fight, so much so that now could be impartial.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat Nag, director - general of the bank ADB, based in Manila, said that two of the fastest - growing economies in the world must `` do everything in its power ''to assist the rapid recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.</seg>

<seg id="1">The warning from the Pentagon on possible cuts in the defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress really put into the boiler, when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget may pose a threat to national security and cause a financial chain reaction, beginning at the Pentagon and the continued over the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly line.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon will have already spend the budget reduction of $450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears the reduction of about 600 billion, if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">`` The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Resort, ''Panetta wrote in a letter to Senator John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the so - called attachment to 23% drop in the standard and the suspension of the many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">`` For such a huge reduction, used this premature manner, it will not be possible to make the most of our building or the ship 's projects - you can buy a three - quarters of a building or ships. moreover, it could lead to serious damage to the other modernisation effort, ''Panetta wrote the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">`` We will also urge separated many of our civil servants, and because it has a reduction in place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly civilians forced to go on holiday, to be able to fulfill the requirements. ''</seg>
<seg id="8">`` These changes may shake the faith of those who care about our army and cause serious damage to its readiness. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Finally, the cuts to touch upon the combat units, said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">`` Although the accounts for the financing of possible military operations overseas, this obstávka directly affect, the operation will be adversely affected by significant changes in other budgets, ''said Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">`` There will be cuts even in the contracting personnel, which will result in a delay of a fixed contracts in support of the war effort of our people. ''</seg>
<seg id="12">`` Reduced is paid staff, which would also delayed payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of the legal and political support. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Both senators Panettovi ten days ago, asking for more details on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">`` The consequences of obstávky at the Ministry of Defence could lead to the rapid degradation of the United States as the world 's great military power. ''</seg>
<seg id="15">`` We are strictly against this tough measures, ''the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when Panettův published a letter.</seg>
<seg id="16">`` It 's not the conclusion that can live, and it is certainly under it, we do not want to sign. ''</seg>
<seg id="17">`` The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not let that happen. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">`` It remains to be seen whether Panettův letter and a fresh warning to increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplify voices calling for the Pentagon 's omission from the list of tightened areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta was recently in talks about possible cuts to more and more open, even though he went on his high position in the Pentagon 's long years of experience to the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was getting tough fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference organised by the previous week, Defense Minister sketched a picture of what may be his Resort wait - shell of the army, in which, however, will miss the core.</seg>
<seg id="21">`` It will be like a ship without sailors. ''</seg>
<seg id="22">`` It will be like a brigade out of ammunition. ''</seg>
<seg id="23">`` It will be like the Air Force without trained pilots. ''</seg>
<seg id="24">`` It will be like a paper tiger, as an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission, ''Panetta said at the beginning of his speech at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">`` It will be like a unit without morals, ready and able to deal with a possible enemy. ''</seg>
<seg id="26">`` The result will be a welcome aggression... ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the Annex supplied with the letter, McCain and Graham Panetta specifies how will have a reduction to result in `` significant operating risks: the late response to the crisis, the conflicts and disaster; a significant reduction in the drops and deployment around the world; the expected an unacceptable risk in future combat operations. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Panetta also said that some of the largest defense projects could wait for the closure, including those that are already being tested, even those that are still in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the list was, for example, a project of the F 35, the planned new bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, the new coastal combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Marine Corps to replace the Humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The suspension of further development and testing of the aircraft, the f - 35 would be over the next ten years would have saved 80 billion, but its proponents argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the army, which is needed in order to deal with potential threats posed by China and other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="13">With many fraud we meet?</seg>
<seg id="14">Studies show that in a single day lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let 's assume that many of them are full of lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in the life of lying about three times.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">Determining the lies, or `` recognition of lies '', is the necessary skills, which should acquire each, whether for work or personal reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to that of, say, a charade, when a man says: `` I have got you. ''- rated deception is a serious science, working with the scientific data collected during the last six decades of prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been refuted.</seg>
<seg id="20">Liar you look into his eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">It 's not enough, said, red or were smirking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Of course it is, that 's kind of hard to spot a liar and reveal.</seg>
<seg id="23">A trained identifier lies can figure out the truth of the sentence structure, small expression on his face, the way the issues and their timing.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent a couple of years of scientific knowledge of large - scale and developing the sector on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is modern skills, which can be easily learn and in today 's complex world, you can really help - especially if your job duties include hiring, the organisation of the interviews, or to the people.</seg>

<seg id="25">Good liars can read well in the other, let 's let down his guard, steering their emotions and intuitively realize the other party.</seg>

<seg id="27">We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when you are lying.</seg>

<seg id="28">How do you know that someone 's lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, the normal behaviour of the body.</seg>
<seg id="30">It 's called `` the initial observation ''.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to a subsequent findings with the match.</seg>
<seg id="32">Note the body of his laughter, work with his voice.</seg>
<seg id="33">You should know if someone is constantly tapping his feet to wrongly accused of lying in the middle of the meeting will begin tapping his feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then try to determine if a verbal and non - verbal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="35">Think of it, but only as a warning signals, rather than as evidence of lies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People speaking a lie can stop moving his upper body, as he tries to remember his cover story, his film to the door, lean to the east, a marked change of attitude or show `` relief after the end of the conversation ''- exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position, when it 's difficult confession behind them.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people conducting interviews often give a false signal, that 's an interview in the end, just to see how it will look like a relief after completion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">He is also the language of the body.</seg>
<seg id="39">The story of how the Scott Peterson had a slip of the tongue and used the last time, when he said that his murdered woman 's life, which ran a national search for her body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Deceivers individuals may also speak bluntly: `` I did not have a sexual relationship with the woman... Miss Lewinsky ''or the difficult question of all over again.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal characters are very small.</seg>
<seg id="42">Anyone can use a lot of `` mitigating language '', as is a difficult question: `` well, to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge.''</seg>
<seg id="43">In such a response is not really know and are often more warning signal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic to reveal any lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills, which gives the lie to hunt.</seg>

<seg id="5">It is expected that the present Government composed mostly of technocrats, although so far is not yet clear when the new government takes power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said that he will present the results of their talks, which led to the political parties in an effort to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">`` I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase, ''said the former European Commissioner journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti explicitly said that it would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles are overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">`` The framework is now clearly marked '', he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, therefore, in a much shorter time than is usual. meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, because of the amount of debt soared to unsustainable levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration, led by a former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package, which require european leaders. only it can restore wrecked the credibility of Italy.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">The Monti is under pressure to hurry because of the volatility of the markets have exceeded the interest rates on italian bonds have a 10 - year 7 percentage threshold level, when Greece and Ireland had to apply for a rescue.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, the President of the Italian the employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with the Monti: `` we said that this government is very will support ''.</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is a last resort to Italy from the burning of the situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Monti 's chances of success are significantly enhanced thanks to the support of the PDL Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced on Saturday, to resign.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Support for Parliament</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new Monti 's government must have the strong support of Parliament, in order to promote the unpopular austerity reforms.</seg>
<seg id="20">Any obstruction or delay in that effort could lead to new and a devastating attack on the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of foreign banks are added to the pressure and warns that Monti 's failure could mean catastrophe.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed on Sunday President Napolitano, who made in response to the crisis very quick procedure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi resigned, the interest of italian bonds returned to a critical level and respond to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To save Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the capabilities of current financial reserves of the euro area.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said that his government should stay in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, and despite the general forecasts, which says that politicians give him the only time to carry out reforms, and then makes the early elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti stated that he would like to his Cabinet, integrated policy, but the big parties insist that the government must be consists only of experts to lead Italy out of trouble, to which the country had been due to financial pressures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You will never again repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think that part of it is, therefore, that we have got nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone loves the other songs, because it 's hard to choose which songs we play every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we got in the repertoire of two of the three songs, which we did not play for a long time, we are focusing on them, and we are also a surprise, because we remember it, why are we so much and that we may have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">So it is for us to show more interesting, and I think that 's more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This tour are celebrating 20 years of art.</seg>
<seg id="37">When you look back, it 's hard to believe everything that you have done?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, that 's for sure.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we will be in a great rock group, and that he is more than 20 years old, it sounds like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We are aware of how much is given to us and moved us, that we can continue to play together.</seg>

<seg id="46">The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising, if there is a movement of the group of friends, it does not happen very often.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time in the city of the group, but it is much less common, from one of the city once had five to ten groups.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud of that and we are honored to be part of a group of Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes, with some of the more we play.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. we are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement, which was founded in Seattle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Also, it is very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and had even after all these years, still the same members.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, we have 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than the duration of the group.</seg>
<seg id="54">I think that, first of all, we are all happy that we are still in this world, and the second, his role is played by the fact that he was interested in each other.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We try not to go too far on tour, because it 's very easy to fall into the trap of the crowds and the people who love our music.</seg>

<seg id="1">Park or the mountains?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects of the meeting on the occasion of a procedure, which carries more than the controversy about the fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Urban competition for 16 gates again opened the debate about the role of the park Collserola in Barcelona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid - 1980 s, at the height of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the government published a number of pamphlets in support of the park Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leaflet defined the mountain as the Great Park metropolitan Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">What 's more, he was accompanied by a number of comparison with the New York Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, in 1987, CMB, Park is back on the minds of many as the borders of Barcelona Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north - south, but up (Montenegro) - down (the).</seg>
<seg id="8">The qualification Collseroly as a natural park is a step in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reference is no longer the Central Park, but the Yellowstone with feisty instead of Yogi Bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such was the position until September, when the city announced a mega, consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of the gateways to Collseroly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gates, of course, is rather the idea of the park.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or someone is trying to put the gate to the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here, the only question: Collserola, park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisational, not on the basis of a reflection of the city, the question becomes the central theme of all of the Barcelona architects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is already the subject as tired as when two members of this old caste elite at a meeting in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it was this act, one of the rare matches between what he thinks three of the architects and předstoupivší university professors.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: competition has merit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to Roldan, after she started a question of the Gulf, `` it should be discussed ''and `` on the side of the mountain,'' so the speech Ildefonse Cerda on green apples out.</seg>
<seg id="19">`` We must be based on the principle that the Barcelona in the park 's beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, the availability of.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, `` said the architect, for which the name of ''the gate to the Collserola `` carry'' lexikologickou trap: `` we must not be `` as inputs into the park, but rather as a definition of zones, where it is possible to act ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, as well as Roldan and Bayona has experience of the world of urban qualifies the proposal as `` an intellectual challenge ''offering `` a danger''.</seg>
<seg id="23">The danger of `` uncertainty, which today is a project of the public space ''after the experience of the 1980 s, who had been in the area for `` the swan''.</seg>
<seg id="24">The first concern is the demarcation of the border, where they should be.</seg>
<seg id="25">`` Something to define the means to do is the next step, ''that is, in principle, to move a step further.</seg>
<seg id="26">`` It should be borne in mind, the new urban planning and scheduling tool, because the current (with a reference to the Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">If we focus more detail on the question of Modol believes that the valleys Collserola can be considered a `` park '', but not part of the Barcelona, and that for reasons of pure topographical.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol also reminded that there is already a work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which `` may not end up in the garbage, ''even though it welcomes the fact that the city offers its context, that the project will hit from the `` first time''.</seg>
<seg id="29">And, in addition, means that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a badge, which allows architects to participate in the debate, but `` doubts ''that it should be just this technical profile, which will create a multi - disciplinary teams (`` it 's all about the skills,'' says), which should be created: `` the architects should be only instruments ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, who gave the name of this game is a complex, because in the papers for the selection procedure is a global vision Collserola: `` it was handed down 16 competitions, which deal with all the axis of the mountains, the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies, which would be on the look and see it as a whole ''.</seg>
<seg id="31">This has meant that he at least, volunteered for all 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the project of one of the gates may hint at the concept and the definition of an architect of the gate.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his view, the town hall was intended to guarantee that the band immediately above the Rondo de Dalt should ensure the whole length of the zone of equipment, to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexico 's Institute of Health Insurance launched the research of the gene that causes obesity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to develop a gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. research carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexico 's Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that the results of research to identify the gene for obesity in children and young. research called `` the genetics of obesity in children and adolescents, ''to get the results on the overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the report, the head of the medical research unit in the biochemistry of specialised hospital National Health Center of the 21 st century, Miguel Cruz López, he explained, that was set up by a multi - disciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionist and social workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team relies on the support of specialists and pupils post - graduate study from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the center of research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To participate in the research may also the general public, with or without permission. people can come into participating in sports centres IMSS in Valle de México, where he was a Saturday from 8 hours to carry out tests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He pointed out that the research began in the sports centre Cuauhtémoc (Gulf State) and from the 8 th of October, this activity is also in the sports centre Nezahualcóyolt (east of Mexico 's state).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once they have obtained data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the sports centre Independencia (south of the federal district) and, finally, in the Morelos (north of the Federal).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the ingredients and the importance of genetics, with regard to the development of obesity, and traced to mexican children and young people risk factors and the prevention of chronic degenerative disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the occasion of the international day of diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, said that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of the parents, for the application of specific questionnaires about nutrition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The questionnaire will ask also for physical activity and a family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid the risk factors, which could cause the disease such as diabetes and kidney failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Said that each Saturday, all the parties are anthropometric measurements (weight, height and waist circumference), measured the blood pressure, determines the level of glucose, of triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and examined the genes (tries to identify the genes that are involved in causing the child obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz López argued that this research reflects the concern of health professionals over the alarming increase in children 's weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">'Health survey carried out between 1999 and 2006, have shown that in just six years, only for the boys to the rise in obesity by 77% and in girls of 47%. a dramatic increase in the case of overweight,' says expert from the IMSS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">That is one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the presumption that the population of the country is different from other stocks his genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Informed that the average Mexican has 65% indiánsko - America 's genetic makeup, 30% of the European and 5% of African. this is reflected in our genes, which are responsible for the development of diabetes and obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained that, in general, genetics, obesity is normally explains as the inability to burn off excess energy they consume (calories), which are stored in the form of fat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">He explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that, given the overall assessment of the state of children, which will determine whether the show some overweight or obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Said that even the presence of the dark colors (acantosis) on his neck and forearm suggests the likelihood that a person would suffer metabolic problems and předcukrovkovými conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The information is confidential, doctors gave him in writing to parents and explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must take to ensure that their children avoid disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz López said that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary behavior indicating a lack of daily physical activity, the day 's sitting in front of the tv and the use of means of transport instead of walking a short distance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Overweight causes a caloric intake, the consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with high fat and protein and the genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the tarmac of UNAM will not be potholes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the chemistry UNAM creates a modified asphalts with polymers and creating a mixture of having to work better, regardless of the weather conditions and temperature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If he is right on the pavement, it would not be necessary to repair the nearly 200 thousand potholes after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, which, at the same time, he added, that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even to be completely removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his lecture technological cause potholes, which said in part of the International Year of Chemistry, said that under his leadership has modified asphalts with polymers, which should be a mixture of having a similar characteristics as the asphalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resistance, both at low, so at high temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example, in some cities in the north of the country has improved. so the functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the hardest part of the oil, is a group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with high molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and the other with a low molecular weight, which are called malteny. jointly supplying the typical viscoelastic character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Viscoelastic character of asphalt is that, at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acts as a liquid, at 120 degrees has high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost as solid, while at low temperatures has the tendency to break, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but they are changing during the day, according to the weather conditions and temperatures, said an expert on chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A scientist from the chemistry was that most of the streets in Mexico City is covered with a flexible, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three are mixed with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the top layer of the blacktop, made up of a small pebbles embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He pointed out that the stone, which is comprised of the cartridge, is covered with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">During the passage of cars or in the creation of the pressure is not possible, to force in the well.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it were a modified bitumen, would be even better, the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">He added that the asphalt cartridge placed last layer called the cloak of soft rock, sand also covered in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given that this is coming into contact with the rims of vehicles must have greater mechanical power than the cartridge and must ensure the friction of the road.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Given that, as part of the pavement will be exposed to a large burden, must have a cloak of sufficient thickness and must be wary of the material from which it is made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The climate, in particular the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factor that should be borne in mind, in particular, the water has had a great impact on the viability of the cartridge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Once, the ground is wet, the water is spreading in, and it 's hard to get out, it causes a softening of all layers of the street, and the emergence of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">He explained that while creating potholes, as the first shot the film and, after the damage to the asphalt cartridge. damage but there at one point, but it is a slow process, which should be discontinued at the first sign of using appropriate maintenance programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a member of the national system of scientists also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layers of pavement must meet the burden of vehicles and must ensure that this burden does not exceed. it is the only way we can prevent the emergence of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera said that, as regards the asphalt, we still have a lot of work and research is at the beginning. is worth noting, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are in other countries already available on the market and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use a high temperature.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">What was missing from the list of Valle for it to become the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">An analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna obtained the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle so acquires 14. the title of the first vícemiss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Valle del Cauca again reached on the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with that, that she was on the stage winner, won a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which became the first new vícemiss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Based on the results of last night 's finale in Cartagena, in which she won, and took over the Miss Atlántico, the Department has won 14 of the title of the first vícemiss. Melina, joined the ranks of women from the Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of the winning, but in the end it was declared the first vícemiss. they include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Loren Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The question many asking what was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">The result is a defeat for the big favorite bands, which in all the previous rounds of the show, that is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and the prettiest face Joile de Volgue. these titles have, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who then took the title of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">One of the key factors, which has ruled that the jury had decided her name only the first vícemiss, is the fact that his answer to the question: `` who do you prefer and why? '', by Murillo Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the question of the candidate replied:</seg>
<seg id="11">`` I read a lot of very, I believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of zkulturňování. book, which I most affected in childhood, ''Little Prince'', a book.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the present time I read `` crime and punishment ''. it 's a book, which is part of the global literature, which we all know and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, russian author. this is a wonderful book called `` El ardor de La sangre''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The answer is not like the term `` kulturalizovat, ''and, secondly, therefore, that the candidate, her individual mentioned in the book.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the ceremony, she said, that is at peace and the joy of the outcome: `` the world is wise, what will be, will be.</seg>
<seg id="15">And you people, read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One of the other hypotheses is that Valle was destroyed by the position of the champions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bogotský reporter suggested that the candidate was from the beginning of the most popular, the most celebrated and it took all the previous price (gastronomy call Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic clothes and the Queen Mother), created the envy of other candidates, stress the Queen, who then on the scene.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It was evident in the first presentation of the bathing suit on the beach Hilton and during the two shows before the final of the coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although both shone, hinted that she lacked the strength and passion that they showed the face of Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a programme of `` home ''on Canal RCN believes that Melinda has won the title of the first vícemiss is confirmed by the fact that the candidate, who during the competition more titles left with a crown of the Queen''.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle in recent days, more hostile attitude to the media and it paid off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince the jury of their interest in social work, which are the basis of national beauty contests.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only on the edge, two days before the election, the international jury member Lucy Doughty, stated that they are looking for a woman who is aware of the social needs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">`` In a competition, Miss Colombia beauty alone is not enough, it was to be seen as something more than just a physical beauty is to focus on a social conscience. it is important that candidates before they enter into competition, have been involved in such projects, ''she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">They also speculated that the ballot Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibrosis, which was on the buttocks. but it 's completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, it chose Miss `` natural beauty ''for the healthiest body, diet and physical activity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the Queen, acknowledges that she did not have the best body, that there is a good girl, `` but the problems with fibrosis at the bottom, which, in my opinion, was not too noticeable, her diminished points until the last day ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the meantime, the reporter Guido Hoyos magazine Cromos believes that, a native of Valle made a mistake when he underwent several surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="28">`` Surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle,.</seg>
<seg id="29">The body was never his strength and we had taken its toll ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this award, which for the first time by the National Assembly of beauty, after the show in a bathing suit the cruel predictions, which was filled with. it was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina allowed her to grant the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether that 's true or not, it is certain that Melina today launched a year of his reign, not as the Queen, but as a princess, from the position, which gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia on various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the national competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, to go down in history as one of the queens, which despite stirring success in Cartagena, the highest crest.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where most of the more than five days through the forest, to get to a place where the bodies were to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle and after receiving the courses, he began to specialise in fingerprints. this science is on the study of the friction of the skin, so the palm of his hand and foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In the last week, which was carried out operations against the Alfonsi Canovi, Eliazarovi told to take the clothes to at least three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was expected something big.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">In a Friday night out in Cauca in a helicopter of the Palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew he would have to identify two bodies and that the suspects that one of them is the man who led the oldest guerrillas in the world because it was asked to take the card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Le 6 N Seminario Sáenze (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when he was with the team in place, where she was dead, because of the physical appearance. looked very differently than in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">He did not have a beard, he was dressed as a villager in the field, without the glasses, a much slimmer.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).</seg>
<seg id="3">The question of the future of Europe on the programme was not originally, but became her up in the autumn, in particular to party members, who are the policies of the government today to the Greeks and maybe tomorrow against the Italians for lax.</seg>
<seg id="4">The proposal for the president of the European Commission 's management was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro - european finance minister, leaving room for doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: `` the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe ''.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only that, Europe is peace, but that the `` nine million jobs depend directly on the euro. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">According to the Chancellor in Europe, `` it is time for change. ''</seg>
<seg id="10">This could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty, designed to strengthen the control of the European Union over budgetary policies of the Member of the countries of the euro area, but also that could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, `` in order to give Europe a face ''.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is, in any case, one of the thoughts of the proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is surely only a little likelihood that all twenty - seven countries in this revolutionary step quickly agree: against the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU, thinks that the same stance also Nicolas Sarkozy.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the direction is set.</seg>
<seg id="14">As delegates rejected most of the proposal to the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Led by worries calm climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. and try to get Congress to talk of the `` small ''european states or on the states that are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogance of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the proposal on Europe gives one paragraph of the importance of `` the franco - german friendship '', Angela Merkel, quoted by France.</seg>

<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 December in Bordeaux, visit the Office for the provision of social support, where she delivered a speech on the subject of repeated from 2007 on the fight against fraud and redistribution of social solidarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">To the accompaniment of the offensive, which is based on the will to implement savings in the context of the increased severity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right - wing of the presidential campaign, the right - wing majority wants to concentrate on the job.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose on the staff of the private sector on the fourth day of work before they start taking aid in disease.</seg>
</p>payments
<p>
<seg id="6">Clearly, without the consent of the company 's employee, who had lost four days' wages, then at least 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">The measures, which runs the risk of causing a lot of damage, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring about 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">And also the measures, which would be accompanied by other measures of a symbolic range: to give public employees one day of unpaid work (and still do not have any inability over three days in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these issues are the subject of the debate, the right - wing majority also triggers the diversity of fraud aimed at abuses tied to the work.</seg>
<seg id="10">`` The checks will be much larger and more: if you are caught, you will come back, ''said Xavier Bertrand in the interview given by the station RTL on Sunday 13 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth of wrongdoing at work.</seg>
<seg id="12">These are the subject of ongoing monitoring since 2002 and political onslaught, which brought its fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are more powerful than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Let 's stop first in several of the official numbers.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the maladie (CNAM - state health insurance) in 2006 paid more than 237 million euro daily allowance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in healthcare, in 2008, the daily with their 11.3 billion euro 5% in health - care spending.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, 46% of the concerned parent contributions and industrial accidents and 54% of the work, i. e. 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, only 2.5% of health - care costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">According to a study by a group of Alma Consulting had the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 days work versus 17.8 days in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="20">Average, which carries a certain derogations: another poll published in 2007 in the pages of dealing with the Monster. Com showed that 75% of respondents 40,000 french workers said they had no day of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time by the institutions of sickness insurance, argues that, in the 2010 37.8% of jobs are less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.</seg>
</p> 
<p>
<seg id="22">When compared with their european neighbours, french workers are more than elsewhere, prone to work.</seg>
<seg id="23">A study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (the National Research Center), showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence of (for reasons of health or not) oscillate in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Cheating at work represents only a very small part of the compared to work on the black.</seg>
<seg id="25">As regards the fraud, these are just a small - scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of the legislation since 2002, that there is a systematic controls on the work of more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008 the CNAM noted that, with 1.5 million checks was 13.8% of 285,000 carried out for short - term defaults, `` irregular or too long '', i. e. 37 050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of systematically controlled for more than 45 days, there were 11% of cases of `` non - adapted or irregular ''to 1.2 million checks, i. e. 132 000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">A total of 169, 000 `` irregular ''cases of several million workers, who had the inability to work.</seg>
<seg id="30">The number, which is far less than the number of jobs in the black.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the report on this issue, this number would be a 9 to 15 billion euros of missing in tax revenue for the year, i. e., more than the total amount of daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than fraud associated with the latter.</seg>

<seg id="1">It should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Commission of experts</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the report, the canadian company 's Canadians who denied the death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care, and even in the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The canadian company 's idea of the denial of death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of Canadians actually accepts the opportunity to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this sense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It 's one of the findings of the widespread reports of the Royal Canadian Company, which included six experts working in different areas, one of which was the ethics law and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Commission recommended the government to change the law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, so if this option as necessary for the patient, considered to be competent to take such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">At the beginning of the experts cite a recent independent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada placed on the 10 th place, the study notes that the `` medicalisation of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medikalizace yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, telling us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian society.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the wish to die at home, which has the most Canadians, 68.6% of them dying in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">This applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, the figure is the highest with 86% of those who have died in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">As regards the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report concludes that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide will not change anything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">According to the experts, who are also subject to all of the countries where they are legalised or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalise causes some kind of abuse in the application, i. e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on the person or mismatched.</seg>
<seg id="15">Conversely, P. Jocelyn Downie, a co - author of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference more than numerous cases of these missteps in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is not illegal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">`` Euthanasia is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal. ''</seg>
<seg id="17">`` Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, ''says Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadians are in favour of euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We all remember that, according to a survey conducted by Angus Reid Forum in 2010 with 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, because he believes that will allow people to the end of his life to ease their suffering.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the legalisation of euthanasia will mean that we are sending the message that the life of old or disabled people is worth less.</seg>
<seg id="21">As regards the persons who are assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that people should not be prosecuted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the case of the maintenance of or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also on the list of its recommendations to claim that it was in the criminal law states that withdrawal of treatment, for which there is a legally confirmed rejection, is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="24">The experts also requires that the doctors were trained to obligations to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care, and even in the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, in the case of palliative or definitive cessation of already widely used in the canadian health facilities, the Commission is required to be considered at a time when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The other experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts on medical law has already expressed its reservations on the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Canadian society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist on the medical law, characterised the position of experts - the signatories of the reports as `` extreme '', among other things, therefore, that does not restrict the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">`` This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life, which should more than 18 years, could apply to help him commit suicide, ''says Pierre Deschamps, who had studied résumé reports.</seg>
<seg id="31">P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report were building the autonomy of the above all other values, which make up the social fabric of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">As `` in the company, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A specialist medical law Margaret Somerville also expressed `` strong objections to the conclusions of the report which described as ''a manifesto for euthanasia''.</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal Canadian society, especially doubts about data reports concerning the absence of any misconduct in some countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i. e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="2">The facts must win over dogmas</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">If there is a theme that can not grasp on the basis of short - term balance sheets or under the emotion, then it 's energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and price of electricity, have a direct effect on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is natural that the meeting of the election was an opportunity to think about such deposits and on the site, which occupies the energy from the core.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will be successful only when they will explore all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must establish its position on the objective facts and figures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">So far, the world of 7 billion human beings, but demographic developments will from now on, by 2050, a doubling of the demand for electricity, to a significant portion of the world 's population of the important part of life.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, it will be necessary to deal with the lack of fossil resources in order to be able to continue to generate electricity, and may not be necessary to forget about the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions to fight against climate change, which is a subject that is in the process of disappearing from the environmental debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The accident at Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">And that 's why Germany is itself in its decision to refuse to nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which is considered to be the right to build only the last generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some of the countries, will continue with determination in their projects.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States, after the Fukushima decided to expand its fleet of one unit of the restoration of power plant construction of one of the Chernobyl power plant at Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the german model based on renewable energies ever presented as an example of the reality of the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin, the effect of higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported from Russia in particular, a sharp increase in CO 2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants to natural gas and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of these unpleasant effects to be felt within several months.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark deserves to consider.</seg>
<seg id="19">European champion in the wind, which takes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of the wind, which are the CO 2 emissions and the danish electricity prices higher by 65%, or 50%, than the european average.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conversely, thanks to the stability of our energy policy will pay our neighbors invoice for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of french households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in the competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry on the national territory, the french companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be generated strong increases in electricity prices, which would make it the illusion of a declaration on the industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The price that a large majority of the french refuses to pay, as well as fundamentally opposed to this energy, as polls show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We all remember that energy policy of our country to stand up to the industry to 125,000 jobs directly and with 410,000 downstream jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Strong export sector dragged on international markets, a large number of small and medium - sized companies specialised that generate jobs, which can not be transferred to another country.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France has decided to leave the core, to a large number of these small and medium - sized enterprises and came about 6 billion euros per year, of which country it acquires the export of nuclear equipment and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">The owner of the power plant, a nuclear reactor designed to work 60 years, while it was planned Bankruptcy his producer?</seg>
<seg id="28">In the resolution of the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic source of energy production, and that there is no evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The development of the installations of low CO 2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment using renewable energy sources by the french industrial group Areva is indicative of complementarity sources of energy.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carried out a rigorous and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of new power plants.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, to the idea of safety in the blood.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is for the economy, immigration or chance?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The policy in the field of immigration, Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from different angles - the backlog of the police, the courts and the administration 's policy of having been levels, the compatibility of this policy is `` human rights ''to France.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently it was the administrative harassment, which is the foreign students, which had become the current, the Interior Minister (see list Libération from May 23) said that France `` does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waitresses ''.</seg>
<seg id="4">But so far the only rarely discussed at an angle of the economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">I must say that in this area is a very broad consensus between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac your statement that `` thousand unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million migrant workers, ''and on the left, Michel Rocard, as in the 1990 s, said that France `` can not take all the poverty of the world''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, he was the fear of invasion of hordes of polish plumbers to the french territory of shared the left and right.</seg>
<seg id="9">In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden on the economy and the french company.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference lies in the degree of generosity, which is to provide immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme is François Hollande, limits on banalities, indicates that the joint development will solve our `` migration problem ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem is perhaps in elections, economically, but it is very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As I recall, the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: how Migration shaped our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 pp.): between specialists, there is broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that immigrants adopted.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reducing immigration is crippling the growth and employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Concerns about the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace french workers, especially those less qualified, and create a downward pressure on the wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants, much more than by supplementing the replacements for the french staff that they carry out the work in sectors with a shortage of staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">Few skilled immigrants in sectors that the story of the french staff, and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors in which education is not enough supply of seats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The positive impact on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As well as the surgeon will have trouble with the work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesthesia, the addition of between the French and the migrants are causing the arrival of immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of french workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri so calculated that the growth of migratory movements on the 1% of a long - term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of its immigrants contributes to creating ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants between America 's Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Migrants are also in european countries net contributors social systems, on average, at a rate of 1% of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">The World Labour Organisation, e. g., estimates that in Germany one immigrant arrived at the age of 30 years will bring in my whole life in public budgets net contribution (revenue minus costs) 150,000 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate, the desire for missing percent growth `` with bared teeth ''.</seg>
<seg id="25">The teeth to deter immigrants to effect the reverse.</seg>

<seg id="7">No, democracy requires much more: the public space, public spirit, values, the organisation department and control of the power of education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The crisis of Europe, which we are experiencing, it is the economic crisis, but it 's just so, since the beginning of the crisis policy and democracy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The errors of the greek referendum - yes - no will have in this respect the value of double revelation: the discovery of the need for a return of political power, but also reveal a dramatic sense of his inability, his inappropriateness.</seg>

<seg id="11">The truth is, the front line of the democratic contest today moved and that many of the republican fighters firing in the right direction.</seg>

<seg id="17">It is not the whole of Europe, which is on the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="18">About the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it 's all of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty and each of its peoples.</seg>

<seg id="19">It is urgently needed to return to the european project democratic sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the only together will be able to reduce the weight of their debts of Europeans, to get rid of the markets and investing in the future.</seg>

<seg id="3">They must deliver gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the russian gas giant, to this event due to celebrate.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, the last Tuesday, attended the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline, which under the sea directly linking Russia and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, german Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned jointly control valve around the entrance of russian gas to western european network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">This new pipeline flow each year to Western Europe 27.5 billion of additional cubic meters of russian gas pipeline on the length of the 1, 224 km of the region of St. Petersburg and the federal state Mecklembursko - Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="8">The pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the amount that is equal to the entire french consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">And there are no longer recalls the chance to build a third line of the gas pipeline on the same route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom is the timely completion of this huge construction of the nature of the victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project strongly protested against Poland and the baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nord Stream, in fact, to supply gas directly to Germany without being held around the country a third state (Poland or Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, these two countries are losing a bit of power: the possibility of pushing for Russia threatening to shut down access to western european markets, it becomes more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hard to Warsaw, when she likened the Nord Stream for `` new of the german - soviet Pact '', with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">Does it mean that it is a politically sensitive topic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe through its support for the russian project in it has gained greater security for their purchases.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is at the cost of weakening of Europe 's energy, because the project has created a rift between Europeans from the east and west.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia had barely five years ago to promote his vision of a close alliance between Russia and the rich western countries with high consumption of gas, whose deposits are coming to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">`` This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, the new line, which connects us organically, ''said François Fillon at the opening of this pipeline, and has demonstrated, at what point are large gas contracts things both political and economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the leaders of Gazprom 's present in large numbers in Lubmin, the place of gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical offence.</seg>
<seg id="22">An undersea pipeline is made of steel, cement, in order to protect the marine vessels.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lies at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m.</seg>
<seg id="24">In its construction was necessary to avoid the originating from the time of World War II.</seg>
<seg id="25">`` For the safety of them had to be almost a hundred removed or destroyed, ''says Jens Mueller, a spokesman of the Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It should also be increased measures for the protection of flora and fauna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The pipeline is a long metal snake as 242 Eiffel Tower, which at its full length is nowhere to be suspended or valves or stations maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">One of the platform to be constructed in the vicinity of Sweden, but the project leader rejected it, when the swedes were just a few greedy see the russian state company, how to permanently settle in their coast.</seg>
<seg id="29">`` In the event of failure to stop the gas for less than 1 minute, ''says Jens Muller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of the leaking gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is builders considered unlikely, he welds was designed so that the leak was once every 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The gas pipeline from the outside by a robot submarine drawn by ships, while the interior of the gas pipeline is controlled by the device, which is circulating inside.</seg>
<seg id="33">This device cigar - shaped by an average of 1 meter is introduced to the inside of the line and is led by gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">In goal after three days of travel at the speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information about the possible distortion of metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">Remote gas pipeline is designed to work for 50 years, without any need to repair.</seg>
<seg id="36">The circulation of the gas is simply to ensure the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">For the implementation of this project joined forces five companies.</seg>
<seg id="39">The remains of Gazprom, which holds a 51%.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was joined by the german company E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the dutch company Gasunie and the french group GDF Suez (9% each).</seg>
<seg id="41">The five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">The company has its headquarters in the town of Zoug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom subsequently this company rented for five years, which can be renewed, all of its capacity for the transport of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">`` Gazprom will profit from a total capacity, whether it is the reality of the gas any '', explains Jens Muller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was assured of 30% of shareholders and of 70% of the bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the work would have to 7.4 billion euros for the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="47">For the group GDF Suez and investment costs rise up to 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are aware that their costs will return, because of the risk of takes only Gazprom.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why is such a high proportion of the unemployed disabled workers?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Around 19% of people looking for work.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today 's opening week 15 for the employment of disabled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite the proactive public policy established in 2005 is the percentage of unemployed people still more than twice that of the average, i. e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="5">It 's a depressing?</seg>
<seg id="6">`` No, underlines the Éric Blanchet, director - general of the Association of Adapt, which organises the week for the employment of people with disabilities. ''</seg>
<seg id="7">`` The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable. ''</seg>
<seg id="8">`` At the time, it was the percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher. ''</seg>
<seg id="9">`` However, it is still much to do. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said that for unemployed people, there are still many obstacles before entering the work.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is an older person: 37% of the more than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have low qualifications: 80% have graduated from high school and from 2.3 million students of the university 's only 10 000 handicapped.</seg>
<seg id="13">And finally - long - term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, these are the criteria that particularly complicated by the return to work and that they are `` core of the problem '', according to Christian Grapina, Director General of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992, in order to help businesses to adopt disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So, as far as the objective of the brake.</seg>
<seg id="16">Left, ways of thinking, of course, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study carried out in April by IMS - Entreprendre pour la Cité finds that the managers are `` low level of knowledge about disabled people ''with `` an exaggerated idea of persons in a wheelchair and psychiatric or mental deficiencies''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result is that private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from that, in order to achieve the objectives of 6% to employ disabled workers laid down in the law of 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last known figures, which come from R. 2008, the equal of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">`` Now we move around 3%, ''says Pierre Blanc, director - general of the Organisation of Agefiph responsible for collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof is that the number of `` fined ''businesses, as well as the amount paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit companies to 46,000 (and on 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">`` The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, says Pierre Blanc. ''</seg>
<seg id="23">`` But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, particularly in large companies. ''</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Labour only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 staff are employed by disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 200 employees.</seg>
