<seg id="4">Lecture three profíků from the field, oblékání problematic figures, as well as seminar on how it is on hold.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer to the final test, the more information, as well as practical tasks ahead of us.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="7">Held every Saturday and Sunday, and even if the rate is really "našlapaný."</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we are with the director of the alenkou probíraly in the exchange rate is not the only boy, as pay woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And such is the overwhelming majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone has a short neck, one was chlapeckou figure without pořádných křivek and someone, being overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stylista procedures must know how zjemnit extend broad shoulders, neck or add the curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We got off, as for the wife of Jennifer lopezové, more PRSA and Boky and narrow, stress and, at the same time, the woman neobléknout figure much too vyzývavě passport.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, there is a difference between the passport and Boky that skirts or trousers really out of character, then it makes sense to keep ušít at least one such piece on peace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly you will not regret it, because it is perfectly padnoucí clothes to nezaplacení.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="15">In skirt on peace, you will feel much better than in the one that you are constantly shifting, vyhrnuje odstává those and so on.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">Such information and the types of figures is, of course, a lot, so I am glad that I have a whole week to have all the information on this utřídila in my head.</seg>
<seg id="18">And fear is that, because it is up to zadanému domestic task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the kurzistek, received přiřazenou celebritu, which has come up with two outfity: daily and evening.</seg>

<seg id="24">Moodboard, as will the result, says that, as well as our personal style and relationship to grafickému ztvárnění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Think a graphic side of stylingu is important, too.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stylista is neobléká just physically, but also creates the product pages in magazines, for example - to a specific project, for example, the trends of handbags, of convenience, etc..</seg>
<seg id="27">Tell us about that stylista and návrhář Mario kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But this only on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Stylista must have a general overview</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturday a lecture nabitou information about the kinds of figures zpestřili now three guests from the field.</seg>
<seg id="31">Stylista John humble, fashion návrhář Jakub polanka and fashion photographer Ben renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and stylista, should be used.</seg>
<seg id="33">And šikovný stylista can work with one piece of clothing in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">Variabilita is crucial in this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">We should be a trenčkot - or if you want trenchcoat initially, it is possible to be standard across the džíny and Triko as cover, but it can pay for the bare body, on the road lodičky and nafotit as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just roll rukávy or límce and now the look is different.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The play a," stressed about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But I most appreciate the following advice: "You need to work perfectly aware of the rules."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Then you can begin to break," he said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, it is so clear to me why the drtíme all those propositions, what with the combined, to what, why, when and in fashion magazines Sometimes we see something else.</seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention the přehlídkách.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the fotografovi benovi, I know that stylista must have prepared a lot more options clothes than they fotit.</seg>
<seg id="43">So in fashion story, which will have 10 parties, 10 outfitů, I have to be ready to "nastajlovat" at least 15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also that looks and works in combination with other pieces at fotce clothes sometimes very different than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With that, so we have to create a outfitu count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and style is doing, sometimes up to half the success we confirmed John humble.</seg>
<seg id="47">You only have to look at the madonnu image and marketing, which is not a miracle zpěvačkou, but make it a world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech republic is still approach to the use of services stylistů rather cold.</seg>
<seg id="49">As well as familiar faces, it sometimes as unnecessary - just did something that I can, that, as in vypadám is secondary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if they are from the US people leave a styling, then we have expected that we nadiktuje likely to completely different - smaller size than it really is.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then left to googlovat and to see whether the tabloid nepsal about the fact that the celebrita ztoustla / zhubla and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">John and Mario put us on Sunday to lead the heart, that is not enough stylistovi is in vogue and outfit to cobbled together.</seg>
<seg id="53">Above all, communicate with people in their work, which also putting on, and so it is important to be a good psychologem.</seg>
<seg id="54">To estimate the people nepodbízet, the State for his point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"When you objedná any manažerka, it protřídili šatník and added it to fine pieces, so it can not vyházet a skříň and say, for God's sake, this is the horror."</seg>
<seg id="56">'find at least a couple of things that pochválíte there and Will you encourage, for what they wear, "says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It also specifically showed us what it must include a "placovka ', or the Taška on Plac.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is the one zapnete around the passport and you are in possession of all the necessary propriety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In addition to the clear things, such as the gap, váleček chlupy or zavírací pin factor, there are also silonová thread with it stylista vypomáhá in focení products, such as handbags and hats, special klipsy, which sepneme behind the clothes, if there is a greater špendlík or other svorka are not admissible, destroyed the dress, or šitíčko.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">In order to just neposlouchaly, but also something virtually vyzkoušely, we learn, as well podlepit shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">And in the ateliéru where there is equal focení surface, podrážka could harm, let alone outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And so we lepily and lepily.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nůžkami shoes we must not affect that happens to damage.</seg>
<seg id="64">Is there a need to really zručnost.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario pleased with me when my creation of the unqualified praise.</seg>
<seg id="66">The zručnost, is not really my kámoška.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Each this is only a tiny fraction of what we listen on the second a continuation of the course.</seg>

<seg id="6">Promised that years of Race Series Need for Speed once again take a new direction, and of the hratelných highlights seemed like the game in žánru action involved, which would not only be in number.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were also curious, as will the passages in which the hero will be deployed from and will take place after their cars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But as it is customary for a series of NFS, many is in effect a little differently than we expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is potentially a decent arkádové, but a whole stretches down a few unnecessary errors, which are more or less in a series of for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So it is that they are not even the mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible laziness of the vývojářů.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Adventure is very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">You are included in the story, which the hero Jack has Some problems of personal character and as a solution offers participation in illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the wheel usednete on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is dorazit as it is the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea brings with it some interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">Route is divided into 10 stages, and then to more than 50 plants.</seg>
<seg id="16">The implication is that every race goes on the other line, and the stage is set in various different enough and interesting environment.</seg>
<seg id="17">One that does not have a moment, a feeling that it still offered the same game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Moreover, some of the environment are very nice to see, even though the technical level of works of grafiky corresponds to the previous series.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it is no světoborného.</seg>
<seg id="20">But ride across the desert landscape, the autumn or in the zasněžených high mountains are vizuálně very pleasantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Plants are also from time to time zpestřeny some netypickým element.</seg>
<seg id="22">IN THE DESERT, for example, přimotáte into sandy storms, which greatly reduces visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">By contrast, in the mountains, you must be careful not to make you nezasypala avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, they are well behind nasázeny individual race.</seg>
<seg id="25">While there are only a few types, but it is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">Point, so you předjet the required number of rivals in the essence of the classic race, then, doháníte time - classic battle with the stopkami - and then are waiting for you to be duel with a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">From time to time, even in this připlete, as well as the police, which all your efforts are making. difficult even further</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">What are those outside the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rather it is just such an interactive animace, when Jack prchá majority before someone and you must help him so that, in the right moments tisknete right buttons.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Surprise, however, that these passages in the game is much less than you expect - perhaps even only three in particular.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, but it is a good thing because the element has a chance to become otravným and in the context of this grows, so one of the elements that zpestřují game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Driving model is following in the footsteps of previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that in this day and age, it is definitely not kdovíco, but one can not say that it would be záporem.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are looking for from realistic simulating,, you will have to look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But akčněji pojatému involved driving model suits here still quite well in the competition, although we could find better.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, all well and good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the problems are starting to emerge after a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="39">In contrast to jízdního model, is no longer power in order kolizní model.</seg>
<seg id="40">From the Games of this type, that we spočítá difficult distortions and collisions, but when in fact to any nárazem into any building you have your car will do, then it is probably the least suspect, as everything in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typically in close předjíždění or míjení cars in normal operation, sometimes only a little olíznete each other, but sometimes in almost identical situation will end your car in the wild piruetách.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even a napadrť.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the restartů system that is not particularly does not matter, but it rozladí you reliably.</seg>
<seg id="44">Restarty are handled in such a way that if the rozmlátíte or vyjedete far out of line, way back on the last game you a clue on the track.</seg>
<seg id="45">But only five restartů is available in every race.</seg>
<seg id="46">When the race vyčerpáte, you have to start again from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">So it is that AIDS, in case something goes wrong, rather than that you can explicitly rely on them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">But sometimes even restarty will not help to solve it is to the need to learn the section of the race by heart.</seg>
<seg id="49">A neduhem Games is that often the same thing happening in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some zatáčky so it is necessary to drive in a specific way, for example, or it will simply nevejdete in them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">At other times, one sees around on the ground "civilian" there are always in the same configuration whether you go first, pátí sooner, by five seconds or a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">Naštve especially in situations where you can see how easily between the two protijedoucími cars opponent before you projede, while there dojedete you, vehicles are already in a position that is to objíždět or přibrzdit.</seg>
<seg id="53">Is one that dojedete to them, because it is "so that the situation was" spočítáno always just before your eyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Rivals also have another advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">For all the time playing you in a few places, where, once again, regardless of the time, you always předjede the same opponent in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">Most praští at the end of the game on a bridge, where you go in the protisměru.</seg>
<seg id="57">Opponent to get there before You must clearly not at any price.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it is in front of you, so you are getting worse picture of the protijedoucích cars, so there was some rozmašírujete had much.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Can we do understand the game napínavější and adrenalinovější, but it is so obvious that you carry out a reliable znechutí quickly.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is a pity, because despite the simple driving model is fun and gaming, and the action, so much so that sometimes literally nestíháte monitor, where what lítá.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is in this is actually one of whether to credit concept with padesátkou unikátních lines, řazení plants, so that nuda did not have a chance, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Atypical idea is the exchange of cars during the race.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must be careful about gasoline Pumpy for journeys, because that is where you can change the car, while the vast majority of cases, the vystačíte with what it is you are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sporťáky are appropriate to urban areas, strong American bouráky equal highways and exotic supersporty on technical eco-driving, for example, after the klikatých mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Goes hand in hand with the příběhovým regime and mode of challenges, which are a lokacích individual, of which you are aware of the story.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here you are given not only the medals, but also zkušenostní points in their profile, which is common to the challenges of the story.</seg>
<seg id="68">To obtain a higher level of drivers odemykají different subjects, ranging from cars to pozadími for profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is linked to the online autolog functions, which among other things is again at the same time, your achievements with other players and the obstarává another community functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the other, obscure kopanců is the situation of the last race in the story.</seg>
<seg id="71">With her, then you get into a tunnel underground is, where the ženete in the dark on the tracks - so be it.</seg>
<seg id="72">On the tachometru you blikají figures between 150 and 200 km / h - is - and this in turn zezadu přiřítí souprava metro and uncompromising sešrotuje you.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the Bureau and perhaps even us for a couple of days last debate on whether, in the creation of the game, in fact, not even a little bit nepřemýšlel or whether the authors are really having so much for us blbce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Technical aspect of the game is nothing extra, but at least the visual impression is very pleasant and in some cases, even the Great in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="75">Zamrzí so that, in some vypjatějších moments in it, and in some cases quite tragically.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it is, above all, bouraček with larger numbers of participants, Where would you replaced it was no longer just of no avail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Zvuková site is in order, and soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In an attempt to attract the widest variety of younger audience is soundtrack rather different from the category of "Every dog together," but it can be assumed that, for listening to music, the game will not only about as someone to buy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">Overall impression of the Need for Speed: the run is a puzzlement.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game vyvarovala completely unnecessary errors, then we nebáli say that it is the best part of NFS run over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But this game is nedodělaně.</seg>
<seg id="82">Entertainment, this is definitely a fine, but be prepared to force that you will třískat mistakes in the eyes of spotlight.</seg>

<seg id="11">This dovolilo us during our first centuries to transform the technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that we will manage to achieve even more in the second hundred that, "remarked on the anniversary of the Director Samuel J. Palmisano companies.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson in the 1930s, taken to care for their employees, as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM had as one of the first American employees paid leave, insurance from employers plus elegant staff uniform and a system to pay the best inventors and businessmen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just a has IBM over the long term, as well as the relationship with the client.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Society has been since the beginning of the exploitation of the talent - as one of the first of the world's companies, any kind of discrimination, so they can choose.</seg>
<seg id="17">The current plan, in line with the strategy of anti-discrimination is that, led by IBM in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Those working in IBM for 30 years, still holds the position šéfky sales, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM makes the jamy online brainstormingy in recent years, many of which the future strategy and innovation.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Strong position in the business of providing for its strong internal and external image.</seg>

<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but firm, which helps deal with George colony byznysové problems for the use of technology," he added of the consultation Forrester research firm.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself, says there is a difference between the straight to come on the market and the market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or "Big Blue," as it is in the United States because of its logu familiérně dubbed - for a hundred years, grew up in one of the world's largest companies.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is probably nejvšestrannější technology company - is the hardware and software, infrasturukturu hosting and consultation services in a variety of products from servers to nanotechnology.</seg>

<seg id="1">As the tour have prices since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In 1989 in what was then Czechoslovakia was only allowed five of travel agents: Čedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agents at the time, sold only in the most trips to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the West, was very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists travel to leave to the sea in the GDR German Democratic Republic, to the Soviet Union Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea, to Bulgaria, Romania - both to the Black Sea - and in Hungary - Balaton.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, then, however, the Yugoslav regime embrace to the west and the way of the Czech tourists in Yugoslavia, have been very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The ultimate irony, socialism was that citizens of the Socialist bloc - i.e. also čechoslovákům - not been allowed to travel individually or as part of the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would, in the event that Czechoslovakia individual citizen to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, has not been so needed in this country zvací letter or individual way possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agents offering trips to the West, but at the time it was necessary to stand overnight spacákem or have in the front office "well known."</seg>
<seg id="9">NOT SO, however, was not vyhráno.</seg>
<seg id="10">The FX Promise, which was a condition for the trip to the West, was granted a "politically nespolehlivým people" who could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Czechoslovakia's currency is not freely směnitelnou currency without any exchange promise has not been able to obtain financial resources - Western currency - on the road to the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">By far the most often, however, the Czechs take holidays at home, which were a large number of chat and chalup, which the Czechs pořizovali and this custom survives to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Travel since 1989, the Czechs and experienced a real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Whereas in 1989 was leave our a maximum in the GDR or Bulgaria, spent last year the Czechs 4.5 m holidays abroad in countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Huge paradox, which we are not already aware, it is, in fact, that was not possible in 1989 for us in today's most popular travel freely, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Immediately in the early 1990s, the abolition of visa requirements in the neighbouring West European countries, which was triggered by a huge wave of short visits Austria Vienna or Germany in particular.</seg>
<seg id="17">čechoslováci, could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone is there for a long time I would look at least for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were in Paris sleeping trips, for example, the Czechs in parks in tents, as our revenue nedovolovaly then, so that we can pay the hotel or penzion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of travel was the Czechs in this time of vození own food banks, salámů, etc., in order to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible, the Czech koruna and our tourists can finally, after many destítkách years to buy western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living, and with it the average pay rise, however, which resulted in around 1997 in another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel, a travel agent prepare trips charterovými air spoji regularly since 1997, and the air trips due to the possibility of nasmlouvat quantitative sales in comparison with the past incredibly had become cheaper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the late 1990's they already had the Czechs visa waiver to virtually all advanced countries in the world, apart from the US, which continues to facilitate our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of a post-revolutionary travel came right back in 2000, when he was due to the significant demand vypraven from the Czech Republic, the first ever direct charterový years in the exotiky, it was in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">From this year, and every year vylétávají with Czech tourists chartery direct to teplých distant lands, already this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic in the twelve exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Exotic country visit currently has around 100 thousand Czechs per year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting point in this period, which stands for our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> 17 November 2008 removed the US visas for Czech tourists and that our country definitively, among the most advanced countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, as well as the Czechs for the first time in the history of spent more than half of their holidays abroad - 50,3% - and for the first time in the history of it spent on a foreign holiday, including the costs of the whereabouts of more than 15 tis. Kč per person.</seg>

<seg id="10">There is not a consensus, who actually has the right to a vote - if the only statutory representatives, or even the officials the full power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In the only point a partial agreement since then, helped by the Constitution and the right for the state, in which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are disputes but still on the electoral law.</seg>

<seg id="14">Look at the possibility of elections has changed several times, but neuralgický point is still the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round in order to rule out the possibility of a stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Controversy is whether to be in line with the statutes or find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents fačr Dusan freedom, which represents professional football in the leadership of the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the statutes of the proposed model wins in the third round, one of the candidates, which will have a greater percentage of support in the House, FOR WHICH IS running.</seg>
<seg id="18">Morava is said to be prepared to go to the concession, that won the candidate who gets higher cost per cent of the votes in both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Czech side on condition that the winner in this procentuálním population must be given at least a two-thirds dominance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"But it would then pozbývala sense the two previous rounds, it would be totally Office denied bicameral concept," understands the objections Moravské party freedom, which would have been the best of law neohýbat and vote according to current guidelines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Somewhat surprisingly agrees with this, as well as Tomas paclík, although it is estimated that the statutes for election law suits peltovi most of all the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I wish to decide upon the maximum under statutes."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In order to nevymýšlely Any substitute nonsense as the pile of the past," said owner Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and vymezoval primarily against the peltovi in their comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">In nymburce according to him, the new president will be known, and believe that the candidates to work constructively together will be in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">"All the passions reassures the possible today's procedure of the national team at the European Championship."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Football, it will be up to a wave, means there will be more willing to cooperate," jablonecký leader myself, which has experience with the management of the three biggest football at both professional and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is restrained.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very conflicted."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is not from the Czech and moravy among people, but there are Focused efforts to adapt to the rules."</seg>
<seg id="31">"That can cause it, that will be blokaci General of once again."</seg>
<seg id="32">"But I hope that common sense will prevail," he said rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The agreement of all parties, there is a lot of time.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some of the negotiations would have to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether to match will be the soccer generalita complete at all.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">Perhaps in the end will be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, to which can be reported on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Minister of Education, Youth and tělovýchovy Joseph Dobeš would like to persuade divided parties within the sports associations in the country to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football, as well as in most of the čstv that will deal with the new direction of the Czech sport after financial problems sazky.</seg>

<seg id="47">"For me It was crazy, though some said that, at this point, with the Czech football or do not want to identify."</seg>

<seg id="49">Paclíkovi, now most of all with peltovo links with President plzeňského regional football union Romano berbrem man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes, known as powerful a lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting delegates on the pile.</seg>
<seg id="50">For paclíka is unacceptable, so that pelta came to the position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If he won, so zakonzervuje the status quo and nothing would be in football's ahead."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in combination with the support of berbra, which is zdatným trader football, it would be even more," said paclík.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the event that it paclík in Thursday's vote triumfoval, but with peltou could imagine the future cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Another candidate, is rajchl, which paclík supported before the zářijovou much of which ended in fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="68">"This is one of the key things that should be the new president to address."</seg>
<seg id="69">"If there is a taxing hazard to declare political parties, so I understand their reasoning, but on the table to say where the money goes," said.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="70">As a burden now paclík takes or its link with plzeňským club, though he says that the President of fačr should be "bipartisan."</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta, meanwhile, is associated with jabloncem rajchl with the Prague duklou.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>

<seg id="13">Yet was used, as long as the new stánku art nedočkalo in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and chátrala more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf krischanitz pavilon as to rebuild, is now the title of "the House of the 21st century" and will in the future be used as a museum contemporary art.</seg>

<seg id="19">In addition to the works of art should be subjected to sochaře Fritze wotruby stejnojmennou foundations, it should be kavárna and bookshops, and had to be built to kancelářská building.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision, low budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To carry out was then krischanitz ideal memberships.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only that as to rebuild and expand the secesní sensitive construction of Joseph olbricha in Vienna, and won the competition, but because of schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and pavilon for him was "an extremely important place," on which "just about every weekend," prohlížel exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the founding and know the problems of the project, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change of use lost on their generosity and ease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reconstruction were far greater problems: the building was "katapultem for energy," says krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">Profiles of Windows skleněné fronts have been substituted, used skleněnými fibres vyztužené insulating glass ones and skleněná roof replaced by a special security sklem.</seg>
<seg id="26">Chladové mosty-ocelové nosníky were stepped up or substituted, and asbestos vyplněné ceilings sanovány ones.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two underground floor has rather than for the New use, zapuštěný lighting channel between the front and street obstarává lighting to the entrance leads stone - almost novostavba, but still vznosný schwanzerův pavilón.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original front doors remain the same, it is natřena building in the old antikorozním červenohnědém see one tone.</seg>
<seg id="29">And even kinosál is exactly the same as he had been.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all of this with a strict supervision památkového Office and the low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"often had to be found material which is good and cheap, and later památkovému Office, says krischanitz and point to a broken floor suterénu."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures and reconstruction, the problems remain flexible and vzdušná building.</seg>
<seg id="33">Difficult it was supposedly with pavilonem, "who came here from Brussels," he said recently krischanitz, with "drop-in-the-city-historie."</seg>
<seg id="34">Such architecture, is "always in the wrong place," And yet "wants to give proper confidence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, but it is the house of the 21st century nepatřičném on the ground, as the place urbanistická happy coincidence: in the range of around schweizer garten a completely new projektovaná "urban neighborhood in the station with kancelářskými and obytnými houses."</seg>
<seg id="36">And perhaps there will be yet another happy to chance: the House of the 21st century could receive support from other krischanitzovy works, as sběratelka Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner temporäre kunsthalle and how it is heard, it is with the City of neighbourhood on the habitats in schweizer garten.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank scandal in curyšského lakes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Europe's nejdobrodružnější bank in Switzerland, not based in Italy or France.</seg>
<seg id="3">UBS has suffered in the financial crisis almost bankruptcy and klouže from one crisis to another since then.</seg>
<seg id="4">It now has a German compare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Axel Weber certainly thought so.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his noisy departure from the top of the leadership of the Federal Bank, has become known in July that 2013 to almost as spektakulárního takes a new job: president of the Governing Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in his career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber were publicly praised the Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and friendly comments towards future colleagues said.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The UBS reach turnover."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to working with kasparem villigerem and oswaldem grübelem."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September, it was clear that everything will be totally different.</seg>
<seg id="11">One dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and around 1.7 billion euro zmarnil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The UBS board Oswald grübel respected banker, had to leave, not only in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since then, President of the Board of UBS is also as a opařený - and all are asking: when will finally Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Already has become known, that he can advise the Bank since February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">In May, and the Presidency of the Board of Directors of the Council's already - tell not only in 2013, as the Bank on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It will be hard for Axela Weber.</seg>
<seg id="17">Is not a banker, a professor of economics and emissions banker and it would certainly time to translate the needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, will assume responsibility for the bank, which is once again proved that deserves the title "of the bank's biggest scandals in Europe"</seg>
<seg id="19">As UBS is both great - until recently, was the largest wealth manager in the world - and klouže both for years from one scandal to the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, will not proud Swiss bank free.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started in the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2007 požívala UBS excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Image of mlčenlivého and solid, but also vychytralého Property Managers is combined with the ambitious goals: I would also mean something in the investment banking.</seg>
<seg id="24">So managed UBS 2007 on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more affluent customers than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And, on the other hand, that as an investment bank in the league, the world's largest banks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">That was the impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">Former banker and longtime professor of banking in Zurich later, Hans Geiger tells his students: "I have always a good bank UBS said at the time."</seg>
<seg id="28">"from today's point of view, I have only one asks: how could so wrong?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Very wrong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, it was clear that for the first time, something properly in the UBS gone wrong.</seg>
<seg id="31">Stepped down in the middle of a board chairman Peter wuffli, which so far was also seen as highly intelligent and bankers genius.</seg>
<seg id="32">In a few months later, tušilo, why he left.</seg>
<seg id="33">Investment bank division has wasted subprime-papíry and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">For this to defend, in fact, is recommending UBS capital increase of 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">It recently found really investors, one of which would be even ohrnovala nose: opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one or nedověděl its name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But that was only the first crash.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bank had to admit new billions of dollars of losses, President of the Board of Directors of the Council Marcel ospel, 2006, for a second best all paid the Board of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008 a disaster: the UBS was due to its bad investments from collapse in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nationalbank odkoupila from UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, for which could be spolumajitelkou banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole of Switzerland was otřeseno - as we všimlo, as it is dramatic for a small country, as it has on its territory and the big banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">After all, balance the sum was Switzerland's UBS 2007, more than five times greater than the performance of the economy - see picture.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Once again, we could save UBS 'banking expert Geiger says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The disaster follows another.</seg>
<seg id="45">For several months now has capitulated to UBS in a tax dispute with America and the data has shown a willingness to the wealthy customers who, if possible, to help the banks krátili taxes.</seg>
<seg id="46">Also agreed to vyplacením 780 million dollars - such as the return of unjustified profits from these stores, including pokutové charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">This has more or less openly that helped UBS tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id="48">Lost at the same time, something that has always been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: svatozář secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="49">After this scandal has been the Swiss banking secrecy, as before.</seg>
<seg id="50">Followed by the head of the Board and President of the Board of Directors of the Council.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of customers' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So the Bank has lost its credibility in both the central business areas: in the space of a few months in the investment banking because of the bad speculation and in wealth management for helping to cut taxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when this, a bit of calm, just when it is believed that UBS will pick up again, here comes this wretched business anabáze: one dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euro before Bank zpozorovala, that something is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking that probably still must be wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"case adoboli far too little has changed around, it was found that the health risks," says Martin Janssen, economist and finanz professor of finance at the banking Institute of the University Zürich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial director of a large German banks is sure: "UBS problem lies in the fact that the risk is not coping with the control."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Yet this was, after all, is the idea of a Swiss Bankers caution that start a long time ago, to become hlídači large estates in the world: not too much of a risk, but safety for money - as well as from the party of the Alpine republic, the collapse of the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">Trezory Swiss banks have become a symbol for an unshakable reliability as a Lindt and sprüngli for particularly good chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Headquarters UBS in Zurich, the more suited to cliché good Swiss private banks - it is just a little more.</seg>
<seg id="60">Location is no longer classical.</seg>
<seg id="61">Bank has its headquarters in curyšské bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the curyšskému jezeru, which is zarámováno zasněženými heights Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">Buildings here are beautiful, Pronájmy stores is one of the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Klenotnictví as Tiffany 'with there will be between the Swiss traditional stores such as ice cream parlors sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">Already there is the home of Swiss banks for centuries, from the Nationalbank over palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In recepční shed UBS is heavy otáčivými doors.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside the walls are obložené mramorem in front of them massive Kožená seats, in addition to the large banks směrovka logo to "sejfu."</seg>
<seg id="67">UBS here knows what the customer is looking for: a security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of both the Swiss velkobanky Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse by or zradily, but sometimes - as is one of a small Swiss private bank head.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name would not want to read in the newspapers, concludes at the end of the day, as Swiss Bankers, all with two velkobankami shops.</seg>
<seg id="70">UBS, perhaps too grown, finds - particularly in investment banking, where it is passed anglosasové.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss to perhaps do not have something to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And if after all, adapt to the long Anglo-Saxon ways systems."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">It was Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which UBS has precipitated her first high profits and then momentum: none of the European Institute of financial disaster not lost in the jungle around subprime as much money as schweizer großbank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">15 October 2008 disaster was clear.</seg>
<seg id="75">"IN THE CENTER, agreed the ruling coalition sedmimilionové small countries on the biggest rescue action in the history of our nation," he writes Lukas hässig in his book "Der ubs-crash."</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros approved based velkobanku politicians to save from bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How can this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If we are talking with the Swiss Bankers, so they see the problem in the first place, the size of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, joined two of the three Swiss velkobank into massive concern.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank, which is already In a merger was too large to small Switzerland - and grew still further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Yet be assisted, that the two different banking predecessor complement: a rich, but ospalá bank UBS in Zurich with the focus on wealth management, and poorer, but internationally more involved.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly came internacionalizovaní investment bankers favourably to many of the money with which they can jump-start a roulette.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names associated with the rise of UBS are: Peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, UBS chief concern and Marcel ospel, Chairman of the Board at the time.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I have always thought that wuffli and ospel are the team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and ospel, one following the feelings around žaludku, who drafted completely up the Bank of science."</seg>
<seg id="86">But ospel is said to have relied on wuffliho to an end.</seg>
<seg id="87">And at the end of wuffli probably made a mistake: "Perhaps thought that his models are a reality," said Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"This is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: hubris preceded the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">UBS employees can clearly recall the managers' meetings, in which koncernový Chief wuffli repeated again and again the same slogan: bring the Goldman Sachs of the throne of the mines.</seg>
<seg id="92">The bank has been the world's most powerful Investment Bank.</seg>
<seg id="93">To "league tables, access," which documents the success of banks that time.</seg>
<seg id="94">In it, the UBS sought to putting up completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Several steps it has already forged.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the trade of currency and stock up part of the game completely.</seg>
<seg id="97">Podnikoví advisers, who have been charged with the one weakness: in the international úrokovém trade, however, in the language of bankers' fixed income for the biggest banks, perhaps there is a big gap. "</seg>
<seg id="98">UBS has some gaps in the US hypotéčních products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill the gap closed, poised to UBS to adventure, which almost cost the existence of it.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, investment bank itself as well as it based on ensuring the risks to US investment fund subprime.</seg>
<seg id="101">Developed into a machine, which přebaloval on US mortgage loans and securities an on - at the same time, but also himself leaving the risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Even when other banks have long sought a way out.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Even in the summer of 2007, when the property market was in flames, UBS kupovala there," says banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">How much is eufórie, so deep down.</seg>
<seg id="105">One manager after another had to leave when he attempts uklidit were more difficult than had been thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Position at UBS, has been katapultovacím seat and until now houpou.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Who is velkobanku now has nearly nezvládnutelnou work.</seg>
<seg id="108">Must find a strategy for the bank, all of which disappeared near business models.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banking expert Geiger has no idea: the end of investment banking, focus on management of the property, a return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">Quite so far while the Bank - still - does not want to go.</seg>
<seg id="111">But investment banking has severely cut, so it is now clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">Next Thursday, the new head of bank Sergio ermotti intends to present to the world its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">51-letý Swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, in fact, when the bank surprisingly rozešla predecessor grübelem.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, pushed: has the lead in the long term business UBS, told curyšská Bank on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti Investment Bank wants to give back to the state of affairs in the middle of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">3500 jobs škrtne.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But it will not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">UBS needs vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">The wants to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are questions that Axel Weber already has by now.</seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly but so far only says, that its the first found in Zurich apartment.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The massacre at a personal level</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Peter englunda emotionally strong new book called the beauty and the sorrow: private history of the First World War, the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history instead of the First World War, and a long list of speakers figures, when you zatočí head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">One, as they are in the moment to maintain the Council: carefully this side of the vytrhněte and do the záložku from it.</seg>
<seg id="4">With all the people you look the románovém narrative of Mr englunda very well at this list and you will serve as a Navigation - as a kind of beacon - at a time when, as well as the men and women in the story you feel confused and missing in different situations can be brought.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Mr Englund is Swedish historian and journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also a new Deputy Secretary at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">Paper, which we are discussing here, it is very unusual - the author himself, rather aptly describes it as "antihistorickou work."</seg>
<seg id="8">Contains some very familiar names, important agreements, or of the famous battles, on the other hand, it almost is lacking in Ambassador, energetic journalists and the debate about tactics and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as more "book about what it was." It is mainly about "sentiments, dojmech, experience and moods."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"The beauty and the sorrow in each other," combines war experiences 20 more or less tuctových men and women on both sides of the divide, from female students and botaniků to horolezce, doctors, záchranek drivers and officials.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people are heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others will become prisoners of war, the citizens zblázní or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives are mihotají As the flames of candles zapálených in church - new to add to the spletence fates, while others uhasínají.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Mr englunda paper is different from the traditional historical novels.</seg>
<seg id="15">That regulates the idea of the First World War was just a hrůzostrašných zákopových fighting on the Western Front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The beauty and the sorrow" zručně prozkoumává, as well as other places, where there was a war dramas: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, eastern Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soldiers in this Paper addresses problems with the falling bee nests on them, must spend Christmas in the shadow of who built the pyramids or are dealing with the presence of flies tse-tse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Almost from the beginning it is a very moving reading.</seg>
<seg id="19">War consumes the lives of people like a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina páchnoucí powder keg.</seg>
<seg id="20">When will begin being raised in the distance jump of works and you are the one who is at home with their children, utečete or zůstanete?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who is it coming?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one understands what is going on, or even why the war was unleashed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," observed Mr Englund, "was vyplněno haggling, domněnkami hopes, fears, prejudice, konspiračními theories, dreams, nočními můrami and fámami."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty and the sorrow" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence farmboroughová English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young námořník serving in the German flotile.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are already published all přebírány from životopisů, letters and other materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Poutavě descriptions of their lives can be scary, but thanks to the inclusion of the small moments and details are very lively and credible.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them about suffering and catching up with him.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the story of a German students author says: "alternatives, all the substitutes."</seg>
<seg id="29">"A substitute for coffee, napodobenina aluminium, imitation gumy, paper obvazy, wooden knoflíky."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Food goes even further and describes the substitutes in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">It refers to the "meat vyrobeném from pressed rice vařené in skopovém fat and supplemented by a false outside of timber, tobacco from dried roots and dried bramborových slupek, their shoes with wood podrážkami."</seg>
<seg id="32">Says that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of párků and 511 registered substitutes, coffee."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some of the stories are about honor and bravery.</seg>
<seg id="34">One American in itself is the internal incentives to divokosti and brutality, and on the war, saying: "At the end of the day, you will understand that it is human nature, not sit in comfortable seats with a cigarette and whisky, večerními newspapers or good paper and pretend that this is your mask civilisation, and that is for the škrobeným I in the heart is no Barbar."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">On the other hand, the British soldier is aware that, with the greatest likelihood of die soon and no one even wo n't notice, let alone to truchlil.</seg>
<seg id="36">"When you finally done with the fact that the sacrifices, would at least expected to happen in front of vděčného audience," she writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, however, is as "odsouzenec that secretly oběsí."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other comments on the departure of old Europe and the new horrors.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict is increasingly used to cost economic competition and competitive struggle," Mr Englund writes, "the war between factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">- what is called "a new kind of bestie an emerging Century: výřečný and ideologically controlled by a bitter serial killer in the clothes střižených their bloodshed on peace, which carries out without rising from the table."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People are completely unexpected, podlost does with hrdinstvím.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Englund describes as well as soldiers, who are from the prostitutek intentionally tried to catch any kind of sexual disease, so as to avoid service on the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"nejgrotesknějším example of this treatment has been trading with gonokokovým hnisem soldiers, which buy and deter the genitálie, in the hope that it will end up in the hospital," she writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"The most desperate to vtírali it in the eye, which is often oslepilo until the end of life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the švédštiny from Peter gravese is próza Mr englunda speedy, but not ostentatious, which is perfectly suited to his human subject.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small output captures the way war unleashed totally uncontrollable forces: "extreme nationalism, a social revolution, religious hatred."</seg>
<seg id="47">People are starting to ask why their leaders is to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Majority rather than the best books about the First World War with a comprehensive vyprávěním worked with signs such as "the First World War and the Modern Memory" from Paul fussella or novels such as "All quiet on the Western Front" from ericha Maria remarquea vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="49">Mr Englund prefers nekonvenčnímu concept.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book is the most devastating conclusion, which is unprecedented in the popular naučné literature.</seg>
<seg id="51">You, however, I will not be revealing it.</seg>
<seg id="52">You seem as if at the same time, however, the author jumped from the book, you vytrhl side from the list of heroes of the hand and zapálil it.</seg>

<seg id="11">According to the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, trade unions to focus on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, which wanted to support its claims of an unfair negotiations; hold the view that the poor schools lost more assistants, because they are already deprived of adequate financial resources in the long term.</seg>

It will take place in the arlingtonu in virginii and goes in it, whether the accusations against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, donaldu fail, gets to court.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the indictment states that Gates and he failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is at odds with the constitutional rights of soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="27">Even though women are still officially must not be used in the fight, it was just a clever: in modern warfare can be hard to find a clear the battle lines drawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have teams of female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women vyskytujícími in the war zone.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: Between the wars there were 150 female soldiers - two thirds of them directly in the fight.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time to modernise and in the army, burkeová explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In their fight is not alone and, in this case with three other legal representatives.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">Prosecutors in the case of a burkeové describe attacks just as the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Vojín first class lymanová nahlásila alleged rape by military police, for example, less than an hour later, as it should be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Walls have eyes: scientists are exploring how you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before Anders Behring breivik has become the new face of right extremism in Europe, was just Another young man, who his anti-immigrant views presented on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, the braivik, who has confessed to červencovému vraždícímu rage, after which left 77 people dead in Norway, in his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite breivik could act alone, in cyberspace is solitary: during the preparation of the attack was not spent a lot of time in front of computers, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists, supporting the right of a group on social networking sites.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about those people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as it is to find?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy - just off of Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We have realized that get, it is not at all, so it is difficult," said Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recently published report of the British research team, which was about the European Digital populism.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of personal information on Facebook, Bartlett says, is so vast that scientists had to simply take advantage of advertising on the site and because of that, with complete accuracy determine hledanou demographic group - something that marketingoví workers do for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartlettův team across Europe found half a million fans right groups and focus attention on them and circulated them buses. But instead of them is through them zvali into a newly formed group called them or offer any dietní products, is to fill in the questionnaire, which found the questions about the level of their education, their relation to violence and optimism about their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Through Facebook, bartlettovi and his colleagues have managed to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans, 14 different right wing groups in 11 European countries - all without having had to leave office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is a completely new way of doing research," notes Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of the rightist groups are mostly young men, who popuzuje rising levels of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But, on the other hand, "Those who their online activism combine with off-line aktivismem are more intelligent, more democratic and less násilničtí than those who remain constantly ukryti for screen of a computer."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Work team demos is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers these sites used to study everything from health issues to social trends of sheltering aktualizacemi, contributions to the walls and stisknutými tlačítky "I like."</seg>
<seg id="17">Facebook claims more than 800 million active users, each and every one of them a day on average, with three different data, which makes this social network literally "information supernovu ', which is for the development of many of the new research, and the number of academic work, in whose name is the word Facebook, has risen to nearly 800% compared to the situation five years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some of the scientists is the Facebook that gives them the opportunity to study people without it, that had to bother somewhere on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"previously was that if you wanted to carry out a survey of the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You would have to go to the party, where Bartlett says not, but you never lose."</seg>
<seg id="21">"All of this Facebook odbourává - just go directly to them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others argue that site can offer a way to identify společensko-zdravotní problem and to avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a recent study doktorky Megan morenové from universities in the wisconsinu, the research team found that university students, who were raising their Serbia following a drunken output on Facebook, much more at risk of alcoholism problem than students who silent on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="24">Morenová suggests that vrstevníci student monitor and come up with the supply of aid studentovi site, which publishes too many opileckých statusů.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The problem can not be resolved, if you can not diagnose it," he told the Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of doktorky morenové and Director of the Center for children's health, behavior and development at dětském Research Institute in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We found a way to identify children at risk, that we would otherwise not have had the chance to discover."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook itself constantly sonduje data of its users.</seg>
<seg id="28">Information team sites by the statistics on the connection vztahových statusů and St. Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010 and leverage the satisfaction of the nation - mainly through the use of information, which should approach - internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should her information treasure to research, as well as the other available.</seg>
<seg id="29">But Facebook users know that it is the monitors, whether they like it or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with crony, which is thousands of miles away, there is a need to provide their personal information website.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if Facebook users become part of the research, which do not know about?</seg>
<seg id="31">Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to gather the data off-line online data, however, are open to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I think the majority of users or imagined that scientists could look to their profiles," says Neil Selwyn sociologist in London knowledge lab, of the 2006 study, carried out by the public facebookových walls of their students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"When it comes to them, take it, that the information is only between them and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then we also consider the methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">And in research off-line, there is no guarantee that the body is completely sincere.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook it is impossible to verify, of how much of the information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What you are saying on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, these things are two completely segmented," explains Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is precisely why we Selwin, who spent long years research new technologies, thinks that tužka and zápisník continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.</seg>
<seg id="39">"When vyrazíte into the real world and you talk with real people, this is something that can not be replaced," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">"social research should be on society and social activities - and hell a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 Lessons from a lost interview with stevem jobsem in the film mířícím in cinemas this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of the people who have started - comparing it with Henry Ford - and chose him for his genialitu biggest modern vynálezcem.</seg>
<seg id="3">The recently znovuobjeveném jobsově interview, which was oprášen for special film, which is in cinemas this week, will be Apple's fans the fact that for all his creative minds perfectly well understood business processes and working patterns underlying for its products.</seg>
<seg id="4">Was fantastic designérem, the dream maker and a self-proclaimed member of the movement hippie, but at the same time, pedantským organizer and a man who fits every detail in detail - believed that, indeed, many businesses are suffering from "the notion that a great idea but it is 90 per cent of their work... -LSB- and between a great idea and a great final product is still a long way to go sousta work."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, he worked Bob cringely on TV on the triumph of the computer bláznů, which was about the dawn of the personal computer, during the natáčení is a unique, more than conversation per hour worked.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has been for the last ten years, since the time jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with your new computer company next and eagerly vyhlížel, as the general public accepts the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">In TV agenda was used at the end of the day, only a tiny part of the whole cringelyho discussion and the original copies tradovalo interview, that have been lost in the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after the jobsově penalty, however, have been found VHS copies in the režisérově the garage.</seg>
<seg id="9">This material, to say the least, sestříhaný form the basis of a 68minutového Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, which is in selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who was famous for its AN to provide longer talks, jobs are up surprisingly enthusiastic here, that we can rozpovídat on its technological philosophy and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And also has proved to be a very thoughtful man.</seg>
<seg id="12">Four times during the interview, that the question and the answer will be a prolonged lull - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is to see how the jobs promýšlí perfectly, so that was what nejvýstižnější and the most accurate answer.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when on the surface vyplouvá jobsův perfekcionismus, when in cringelyho issues are impatient, and popohání it to more quickly came to important issues and topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Conversation was natočen before the era of pixaru ipodu or iphonu and there are only terrifyingly prescient example ideas, when jobs are in it, what other companies are doing well and badly, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to browse the posmrtná rating jobsovy career, but to the jobsovi, which we see as a dychtivého snílka flourish in his geniality is something raw and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">Here has its own vision of how it could and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Before long, and after their ideas put forward is also began putting into practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A summary of the seven scenes of lost interview, which certainly worth noting:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Both have learned to manage the business:</seg>
<seg id="20">Business over the years, I have always asked: "Why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that is how it just does."</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks about matters relating to business in depth.</seg>
<seg id="22">I found it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs is the fact that Apple describes their efforts to simplify the books in society.</seg>
<seg id="24">Was totally confused by the way in which they were recorded costs - often start from the slogan "standard" on their level of could only help but wonder at that point, we decided to get out of their own way - Into the automatic tool, which guarantee that could determine during the chviličky trade costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As he rošťárnu on the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs recalls in "blue boxes" that sestrojil stevem wozniakem - equipment, which allowed people to hack into the phone companies and free of charge to call anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the facilities that have been written in the past are already there, but jobsovo enthusiasm when a blue box describes as an instrument of power, are contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tells how in wozniakem equipment testovali using paid phone and during the talks were přepojovat from one network AT & T in the other, while using the greatest number of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We have at least půltucetkrát propletli have around the world, so if we have something that zakřičeli into buying the phone, ozvalo a minute later from the second phone to the door," laughs at the jobs.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and we have found that we can build themselves, that is able to manage the infrastructure for the billions of dollars around the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">They have two, we produced malinkou themselves věcičku, which managed to control the much larger giant - This has been an incredible experience, and I think it would never emerged firm Apple without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs description of the response, which continues with almost brought to an end. wozniakem through the blue box call in the middle of the night to the Vatican and asked for it, whether it would be able to speak with the Pope, and best fork out for Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">Gradually povoláváni increasingly have been the position of the members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, and only just before the phone gave the Pope, the two rozchechtala and sluchátko asked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As the zamiloval phoned in technology - and with billem hewlettem -:</seg>
<seg id="35">When he was 12 and Sháněl spare parts that could stand kmitoměr, found in the telephone number on the bill hewletta list and zavolal him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Not long after their 20minutovém conversation have had jobs guaranteed summer brigádu Hewlett-Packard in society.</seg>
<seg id="37">"incredibly affected me; it was the only company that I met at the time, and formovala my view of what it actually is, and how to behave in such a society to their employees."</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the corporate research labs in Palo Alto, which saw the first table computer, "which was ever produced."</seg>
<seg id="39">Was big as Kufr, CRT monitor and I was supposed to zamiloval it immediately.</seg>
<seg id="40">As I began, in my teens in HP moved higher and higher, poflakoval I am around, computers and began to write programs for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">AS; innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">Jobs in several places during the interview, talking about How are inventing new products for a while.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the beginning of his career, though, has sold a couple of circuit boards, one customer asked him to make up for it the computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Available was only paid 30 days, during which he had found, smontovat and add finished facilities.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, when he was in the company of apple, recalls the challenges faced in the development of computer mice:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember how we were quite wild arguing... screaming at me, -LSB- that it took five years to build the mouse, which would cost $300, and to me it stops talking, I come out and found designéra."</seg>
<seg id="47">About ninety days later, we were able to produce perfectly reliable MOUSE FOR $15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">As big companies are breathtaking:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before it was a resurgence of apple, jobs foresight predicted that many of the industry leaders in their vision of the zakolísá and lose their share of the market.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Say that you are working for the companies IBM or Xerox, so you are doing better kopírky or tiskárny well and what next?"</seg>
<seg id="51">You have a monopoly on the market, so the society society can no longer be more successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">At this point, no longer reigns, Sales and Marketing, so companies šéfují people who are in charge of it, while the people who are in charge of their own products played off against the decision making process.</seg>
<seg id="53">Technological genius, which the company took to her unshakeable position, it is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad - zručnost products and technical knowledge is essential.</seg>
<seg id="54">That is exactly what has happened in the company of Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Company Xerox could possess virtually the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">Could be ten times bigger than it is, could be Microsoft of the 1990s...</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead of a victory, however, zadělali for failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">As it takes innovation as a form of art:</seg>
<seg id="59">"between a great idea and a great final product is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and as the brilliant idea develops, so, too, is changing and growing."</seg>
<seg id="60">During that time, a lot of naučíte about it.</seg>
<seg id="61">You must agree to a series of compromises - some things simply elektrony, glass, robots, or do nepřinutíte plant.</seg>
<seg id="62">You must bear in mind constantly 5 000 things - different concepts - and there are a total of...</seg>
<seg id="63">At the end of the day, depending on taste, try to think of the best things that when humanity has called into being, and in a way it is you try reflected in touch of what they are doing.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists, but the best artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">I never nestyděl for the fact that I am the best ideas uloupil.</seg>
<seg id="66">Macintosh company was so great and so successful, that people who work in it, were excellent, artists, musicians, básnící zoologové, historians and, incidentally, also at the same time, the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">Without computers and new technologies, would be wonderful things in quite managed to other sectors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas večeřeli with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case dealt with the Court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day when the Supreme Court zasedl behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to order against President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the legal firm, which is before the Court will be part of the negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The events took place last Thursday, when all of the nine judges gathered to be discussed by the management proposals on the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">Was one of the probíraných cases action the 26 states zpochybňující a radical overhaul of the Health Care Law, which Congress approved last year - he, which mobilised conservative activists around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Judges agreed they will listen and, in March, however, is expected 5,5hodinové negotiations, the outcome of which is even more rozvíří presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at the time of the decision will be in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lawyer, which stands before the Court of Justice and will strive to achieve the rejection of the law, it will most likely Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clementova legal firm, Bancroft pllc, was one of nearly two dozen companies, which helped finance the annual dinner of the federalist society, which has already spent years dealing with the defence of the conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another company, which represents one of the trade association dinner has sponsored, Jones day, steadily growing groundswell of opinion challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which are at stake in the huge financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dinner was held in a Washington hotel room a few hours after the debate on the subject of this case.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, among others, as well as Mitch McConnell, the leader of Republicans in the Senate and confirmed opponents of the health care law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">And the guests? scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is nothing new: the two judges, the actions of the federalist society have been engaged in for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And certainly it is not anything that would be in line with the rules of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to respect the principles of conduct, which are subject to lower federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If it was not the case, however, their behaviour would certainly come under the principle of C4, which says that "the judge may be involved in the action, which is related and other organisations hold in order to obtain the financial resources, but the judge can not be honest guest speaker, can not be reported to the action."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the relationship scalii and Thomas to two legal firms účinkujícím in case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in the case, more than enough to zalarmoval activists calling for ethics in government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is at odds with several judges, claiming that the Supreme Court is under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of common cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Judges popíjeli and večeřeli on social benefici together with legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss their case before a court of law."</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and help in obtaining funding through this action undermines the feet all claims to the nezaujatosti, which is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas against its critics have shown little understanding and are told by them that they also combine their judicial duties without any problem with the actions of groups such as federalist society.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thomasova wife ginni is highly built Conservative campaigner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Moreover, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly judge Elena kaganová and not scalia with Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kaganová worked as the prokurátorka under President Obama, appeared before a court of law, when the first challenge to the law.</seg>
<seg id="25">Critics of the kaganové pressure on it to repudiate the involvement in the case, and then, argue that the law was so much than that now could be nezaujatá.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kaganová not nenaznačila that it was about to step down.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Determining the lies, or "detecting lies," is a skill that everyone should adopt, whether for reasons of personal or labour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to, say, šarádě when one vykřikne: "I am you." detecting deception is serious science sector workers with scientific data collected, over the past six decades at the prestigious universities in the detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.</seg>

<seg id="16">Thank you, you have stood with us so long for a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="17">It took us almost 21 years before we arrived at the kostariku. Thank you, that you have waited so long and we regret that it took us so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people KONCERTU have been talking about as the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">It generates more pressure on you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the biggest show that we have demonstrated over the last 21 years, arose in the space of a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have some great show in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we have got into a form at a concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">In truth, are looking forward to the concert by power.</seg>
<seg id="23">Love this country, we would like to serfujeme, like jungle. for both activities, Costa Rica, is the best country in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">As you know kostariku and Its waves due to surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have a lot of friends surfařů and I have a good friend who lives in tamarindo. The waves are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends are surfovat on kostariku or in Nicaragua, or in Mexico, the best place to surfing, and we have learned about the Costa Rica, by people who love surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Looking at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many of the písněmi.</seg>
<seg id="28">What you have planned on their presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In view of the fact that we have never nehráli, we have no restrictions on what we could do.</seg>
<seg id="30">To show what the best show with diverse skladbami. Will try to play a couple of songs from each band and to give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never neopakujete repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think that this is partly because we have nine ALB and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves the other's, so it is difficult to choose what songs will play every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two three songs in the repertoire, which we have not played for a long time, we focus on them, and we are also surprised, because we think on it, why are we so líbily and that we have forgotten to this May.</seg>
<seg id="35">So it is the show more interesting for us, and that is why I think that it is more interesting for people as well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This tour slavíte 20 years of artistic career.</seg>
<seg id="37">If you look back, it is hard to believe, what you have done?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="39">Firstly, I think that none of us could imagine that we will be in a large rock group, and that we will remain in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We know how much we have been given and it moves us, that we can continue to play together.</seg>
<seg id="41">Do we have to be happy and glad we make music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are fortunate that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted.</seg>
<seg id="43">We could be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What mean for you, that you were an important part of the žánru grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Always an honour for us was that we can be part of this group, which is represented by the same velikáni.</seg>
<seg id="46">People from the Soundgarden mudhoney and Alice in chains are our friends.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when there is movement from a group of friends, this does not happen very often.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time there will be in the city, but it is much less common for five to 10 groups coming from one city at once.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud of it and we are pleased that we can be part of a group of Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes with some even play.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in chains, and we were in Canada, with mudhoney. We are fortunate that we have seen Soundgarden on tour are all our friends and we are pleased that we can be part of the movement that began in Seattle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Also it is very unusual for the group as yours to keep together and had even after those years are the same Members.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, we have four together for 21 years and Matt - Cameron - join us 13 years ago, which in itself is already much longer than the usual time of group.</seg>
<seg id="54">I think that, first of all, we are all fortunate that we are still in this world, and secondly, their role is played by the fact that we are always concerned about one another.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all close friends and because of this, we have been able to open up the music the way that leave everyone enough freedom to own experimentation.</seg>
<seg id="56">Each other, we believe we do appreciate music of the second, and I think that it could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship to the word celebration was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.</seg>
<seg id="58">As nacházíte balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">How we rostli was gradually becoming increasingly easier to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are trying to nejezdit too on the tour, because it is very easy to fall into the trap of crowds and the people who love our music.</seg>
<seg id="61">When you consider that people come for the music, confront is that with music and what you give it, you have to respect. You then you can not be carried away by famous rock stars that neither one of us have never really nezajímalo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How Mother love bone remember another project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think that we are writing great songs and at the beginning, it was something spectacular.</seg>
<seg id="64">As kapela No Pope an album we get there were three years and we have never been your birth certificate, after umřel Andy - Andrew woods.</seg>
<seg id="65">It was very frustrating, because it took so long and the most important thing is that, even today, přátelíme with brucem - fairweather - and gregem Gilmore, who started in the kapele with us, I will listen to a song, or if I look at carrying pictures, I remember Andy, it was incredible, as I was with him as nasmál; it was a pleasure to work with him, always laugh, a muzice or talk about football and many others.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an incredible person and we lack power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">National kapela Las robertas will be tasked with that launched the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that you know their work, especially Eddie vedder, and that is why you have chosen is as předskokany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, production, send us videos with several proposals and this group, we liked the most, which is why we are interested, as Las robertas offer take one, and they must be very funny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why always take one you are changing the words of yellow Ledbetter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">This is the question on the EDA - Eddie vedder, so that I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">He words, and I think that makes it the first thing it invades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">As a basistu affects who you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">A lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="75">As a first I think Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney Chuck dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There is so much that I could all evening to talk about basistech who I like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">As Pearl pits has managed to keep the grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think that we have always felt slightly separation from the words of grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">To say grunge presenting the group to which I have referred to as mudhoney, Soundgarden Nirvana and all the other, which came at the same time, and if it is even today this music in place, so it is great, because it is something that is worth listening to this music, and groups such as mudhoney play better muziku today than ever before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the outset had your music is a bleak character and it is now more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">What is behind this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This is interesting, because I feel that in the new albu is a couple of songs, which are lehčího kind, but there are also songs such as the end or juste breathe, which are considered to be very grim, even though they can be as positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">For both, it is Ed When I played, I cried, and it is deeply dark songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think that when vyrůstáš and is in the life of a trauma, ztratíš someone from the family or friend, these things will influence your art and music, and these two songs for me are just that.</seg>
<seg id="85">I also think that you can be a happy person and still do pochmurnou muziku.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Flourish in the 1980s, at the time of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona CMB, the Authority vytiskla several pamfletů in support of the park collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">Letáček defined the Mountain as a large fleet of metropolitan Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">What is more, he was accompanied by figures you with newyorským Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 1987, disappeared after CMB Park is back in the minds of many as the upper limit led Barcelona. Catalan capital, is one of the few that do not focus on the axis of North, South, but up - Montenegro - down - sea.</seg>
<seg id="8">Qualifications collseroly as a natural park is moving in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="9">References already was central park, but Yellowstone with divočáky instead of Bear Yogi.</seg>
<seg id="10">This has been the position until September, when city hall announced mega competition consisting of 16 konkurzy on the same number of entry doors to collseroly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Taken, of course, plays rather the idea of park.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or someone trying to put the gates on the field.</seg>

<seg id="19">"We must be based on the principle that nejrozlehlejším barcelonským Park is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, its great availability.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, "said the architect, for whom the title" taken into collserola carries with it "lexikologickou trap": "We do not want to is a" as inputs into the park, but rather as a defining zones, where it is possible to act. "</seg>

<seg id="26">"We need to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current - with the legacy of the PGM general metropolitan plan - can cause a real disaster."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Looking in more detail on the issue, modol believes that údolní svah collserola "can be seen in the park," but not the part of Barcelona, and for reasons of purely topographical.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol also remind you that there is already work that has patronat de collserola, which "can not stop on smetišti, even though" welcomes the fact that City Hall offers his grémiu, that in the hit from the first moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="29">, and understand that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a propustkou, which allows architektům to get involved in the debate, but "Doubt" that it should be just the technical profile, which will lead the multidisciplinary teams - "Is that all the skills, she adds," which is to be developed: "architects should only be tools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that has the name of the game, it is difficult, because in the material for the selection process is a global vision collserola: "tender was 16, which apply to all the backbone of mountains - the sea, but there is no podélná study, which would view the area and see it as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="31">This means that at least he has signed up to all 16 tenders.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the one taken may turn on the concept and the definition of an architect of the neighbouring gates.</seg>
<seg id="33">City Hall, in his view, should guarantee that the zone, just over the Ronda de Dalt should ensure in the entire length of the zone equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexico's Institute of Health insurance - IMSS - announced that leading research in order to identify a gene causing obesity in children and young research entitled "genetics of obesity in children and adolescents." will make it possible to obtain the results of the overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the research report medical units in the area Biochemie from specialty hospitals of the National Medical Center of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it was set up a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, Nutrition experts and social workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The team is based on the support of specialists and pupils postgraduálního study from the National Institute of public health - Insp - and from the center of research and Advanced Studies - cinvestav - National polytechnického Institute - IPN.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="6">To participate in the research as well as the general public, who may or nemající authorisation, and people can come to participating in sports centres IMSS in the Valle de Mexico City, where it will be any soboru from 8 hours to carry out tests teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Pointed out that the research began in the sports centre Cuauhtémoc - Mexican state - and from 8 October, this activity is also in the sports centre nezahualcóyolt - east of the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once obtained data from 500 to 600 children, will be the study will continue in the sports centre Independencia - South of the Federal distriktu - and at the end of the day, in a sports centre Morelos - North from the federal centre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Explained that the purpose of this research is to identify the components and the importance of genetics, with regard to the development of obesity risk factors, and traced to Mexican children and young people and by preventing chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, celebrated on 14 November, reminded us that the aim is to collect data from three thousands of children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for application specific forms about nutrition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Questionnaire will also ask for physical activity and family powerful track record hereditary diseases in order to avoid the risk factors, which could cause diseases such as diabetes or ledvinová inadequacy.</seg>

<seg id="12">Sure, that every Saturday, all of the participants are antropometrická measuring weight, height, district passport, measured the blood pressure, determines the level of glucose monitors, trigliceridů, cholesterol, inzulínu and examined the genes - to try to identify genes that are implicated in child obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz Lopez, said that the research reflects the concern of health workers on the alarming rise in children's weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">'health also carried out there between 1999 and 2006, showed that in just six years, only for the boys to a 77% rise in obesity and for girls to 47 percent. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of overweight', an expert from the IMSS said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Said that one of the reasons for the indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from the rest of their genetic history.</seg>

<seg id="21">Cruz Lopez, explained that there are three main components that are overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle constituting the lack of daily physical activity, a day's vysedávání in front of the television and the use of vehicles instead of walking over short distances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Overweight is also a big kalorický income, it is more of slazených drinks, uhlohydrátů - tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgry, etc. - high in fat and protein and the genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the asphalt of the UNAM will not výmoly</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrero, a scientist from the chemical school UNAM creates modified asfalty with polymery and creates a mixture with better functionality, independently of the climatic conditions and a temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the right pečovalo on nearly 200 thousand dláždění, there would be no need to be repaired výmolů after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of Valle de Mexico City, Rafael Herrero nájera pointed out, the scientist from the chemical school - FQ from UNAM, which at the same time, adding that if the construction and maintenance of a parking dláždění was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of výmolů, or even they might be completely eliminated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his přednášce technological cause výmolů, which made in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that laboratory under his leadership is modified asfalty with polymery, which should rise to mix with similar characteristics, such as asfalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resistance, both in the low, at high temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrero nájera believes that this kind of modified asfaltů could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some of the cities in the north of the country and improve the functionality and would reduce the creation of výmolů.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Explained that asfalt, the most difficult part of the oil is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, with a great molecular, referred to as asfalteny molecules, and the other with a low molecular, who call themselves the malteny together add asphalt with viskoelastický character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Viskoelastický nature of asphalt lies in the fact that the high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acts as tekutina in 120 degrees viskozitu is high, and in almost 50 degrees is in solid shape, while at low temperatures asfalt tends to lámat, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but during the day it is according to the weather conditions and temperature, a chemical engineering expert pointed out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Scientist from the chemical school observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico City is covered by a flexible dlažbou, which is made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asfaltem.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the nejsvrchnějšími classes are asfaltová vložka, consisting of a small kamínky zalitými in the asphalt, and then stlačenými.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Stress that each block, which is made up of vložku, it is zalit asfaltem.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the passage of cars or in terms of the pressure, it is possible that the forces in the ditch well unravel.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it was a modified asfalt unravel would be even better, believes the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Add that on the asphalt vložku place last class called cry, consisting of a fine stones, pískem also zalitým in the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">In view of the fact that this class will come into contact with ráfky vehicles must be more mechanical power than asfaltová vložka and must ensure the friction roadway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In view of the fact that, as part of the dláždění will be subject to great burden, must have the mantle of sufficient tloušťku and must be careful in the material from which it is zhotoven.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Climate, especially vlhkost and temperature changes, they are also very important factor, which is something to bear in mind, especially water has had a huge impact on the functionality of asfaltové vložky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Once the terrain is vlhký water spread inside and it is difficult to get out, and that causes softening all levels of dlažby and the emergence of výmolů.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Explained that during a výmolů as the first poničí film pláště and only when there is damage to the asfaltové vložky. But does not damage in one moment, but it is a gradual process, which should stop at the first signs of the appropriate maintenance programmes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a member of the national system, scientists also explained that the burden is another important factor in creating the výmolů vehicles, and that is why tloušťka each layer dlažby must respond to the burden of vehicles and must ensure that the burden below that is the only way we can prevent many of výmolů.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrero, pointed out that when it comes to asfalt, once we have a lot of work and research is at the beginning, it is worth noting, for example, asfaltové emulze in other countries, which are already available on the market and allow easily repaired výmoly without having to use a high temperature.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The question, that many are asking: What did?</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, the defeat of the great favoritky, which in all the previous rounds has shown that it has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and nejhezčí face. joile de volgue these titles, such as taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, which have subsequently odnesly the title of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury decided to name only the first vícemiss, is the fact that it is not convinced by his answer to the question: "which paper you liked the most, and why?," asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of literary editors leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the issue of she replied:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot and I very much hope in the role of literature, I believe that this is one of zkulturňování. knížka, which has the most influence in childhood," the little prince, "was very deep paper.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the present time, I read "Crime and Punishment." It is a book that is part of the global literature, that we should all know., and today I have with me a book from Irene nemirovski Russian the authors. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Admittedly, the answer is liked, both because of the deadline, one "culturize" and secondly, because it has not been list clarified, the individual the paper marked her.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the formal ceremony Melina has said that it is on hold and is pleased with the outcome: "The world is wise, what is going to happen, it will happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And you people, čtěte little prince is a wonderful book, if you will. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorita.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bogotský journalist suggested that the fact that she was from the beginning of the most popular nejoslavovanější and gastronomická challenge that drew all previous prices OSTER, the title of the public as the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother, gave rise to envy other uchazeček vystresovalo Queen, which then has failed on the stage.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio journalist programme "as" at home to Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first vícemiss confirms the fact that list, which during the competition will receive the most titles at the end of the day, neodchází with korunkou Queen. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, Valle held more nevlídný attitude to the media in recent days and not pay for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince porotu about his interest in social work, which are at the heart of the national competition beauty.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only on the margins of international member of men, two days before the election, Luca Doughty said that searching for the woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"in the competition Miss Colombia beauty by itself is not enough, we need to see something more than just a physical beauty. There is a need to focus on the social conscience and it is important that the candidate before entering the competition, have been involved in such projects," explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Also speculates that the list of the Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibróze, which has been the zadečku visible.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Jorge Hernán Orozco which Queen preparing, acknowledges that the Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrózou to step up zadečku, which in my view did not see too much on the part, she stepped down points until the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from magazine cromos believes that rodačka from Valle made a mistake when they undergo a surgical procedures.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">Clearly, without the consent of the company would be an employee, who is ill, lost four days wages, so at least 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">Measures to create a lot of bad blood, but that risks, according to the forest Echos may bring about 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">And also the measures, which would be accompanied by other measures symbolic impact: to give government employees a day nehrazené sick - until now have no failure over three days in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these issues are also under discussion, the majority of the right it triggers theme of fraud aimed to abuses linked with the labor neschopnostmi this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Controls will be much larger, and: "If you get caught, you will be back," Xavier Bertrand pointed out in an interview RTL individual granting station on Sunday, 13 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seems somewhat disproportionate to the truth of the nepravostech in job neschopnostech.</seg>
<seg id="12">These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught of that bear fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Stopping first on the official figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie - CNAM - State health insurance companies - compensation has been paid out in 2006, more than 237 million euro daily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the health sector represented the compensation in 2008, with its 11,3 billion euro 5% of expenditure on health care.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of that amount to 46% of the concerned parent contributions and accidents and 54% of related to the failure, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">So only 2.5% of the costs of health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">According to the study of the old consulting should the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 days of disability from 17,8 days in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="20">Average, which holds some variation: a different Anketa published in the 2007 on the website of dealing with job opportunities monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said that they nevybralo no sick day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time by nemocenského insurance institutions, specifies that in the 2010 37,8% of the failure was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15% from 1 to 15 days within 1 month, three months and 11% took longer.</seg>
</p> 
<p>
<seg id="22">When it is compared to their European neighbours, French workers are more prone to work neschopnostem than elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="23">One long study by two researchers in 2010 CNRS 'National Research Centre showed that between 1994 and 2001 overall absence - for health reasons or not - has alternated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% in France and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Cheating in job neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the work on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="25">When it comes to fraud, these are just small scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strengthen legislation since the 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks aimed at working the failure of more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="23">Also on the list of their recommendations suggest that the criminal law said that withdrawal from the treatment, for which there is a legally sanctioned rejection, is not a crime.</seg>

<seg id="1">Energy policy:</seg>
<seg id="2">Facts must win over dogma</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If there is an issue that can not be approached on the basis of the balance sheets or under the emotions, then it is energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Disponibilita and the price of electricity, have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is natural for meetings in the election was an opportunity to think about such savings and on the ground, which takes power from nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Debate will be successful only when we examine all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French have set up their position on the objective facts and rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">So far, 7 billion human beings on the planet, But the demographic trends will odteďka doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, if we do not want a large proportion of the world's population of important part of life.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, face a shortage of fossil resources will be required in order to continue to produce electricity, and can not forget about the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the fight against climate change, which is something which at the moment are disappearing from the environmental debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Accident in Fukushima will have no effect on any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="12">But this is not the case with Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source of very capable of replacing them, or Switzerland, which sees fit to build only the last generation plants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote the at least some of the countries are continuing with the determination of their projects.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States has decided to expand its fleet after Fukushima on one unit of the construction of a power plant suspended power plants three pleasantly Iceland after the accident.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model based on renewable energy, sometimes presented as an example of the reality contradicts this.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Berlin is seen rising electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas prices importovaném especially from Russia, the rapid rise in CO2 emissions caused by construction of power plants to natural gas, and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">Within a few months, all of these bad effects to be felt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Case of Denmark deserves to look at him.</seg>
<seg id="19">The European champion in wind power plants, of which accounts for 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of irregularities wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are increased by 65% and 50%, rather than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, thanks to our energy policy will pay for our neighbours more stable electricity bill by 40% higher than at the French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalized economy in energy costs are a key element of competitiveness and the guarantee of keeping the industry on the national territory, the French companies enjoy the benefits of nejlacinější electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would give rise to a strong increase in electricity prices, which would make iluzorními beautiful statement on the industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">Price that the vast majority of the French refuses to pay, as well as the are not against the energy, as polls show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let us remember that our country's energy policy to stand up to the 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 related jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Exportující industry for us is heavily on international markets, a large number of small and medium sized specialist businesses create jobs that can not be transferred abroad.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France has decided to abandon the sacrifice would be quite a number of small and medium sized enterprises and came about 6 billion euros per year, that the country is for the export of nuclear facilities and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">That ordered the owner of the plant, the nuclear reactor designed to operate 60 years, while it was planned decline of its producers?</seg>
<seg id="28">In addressing the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic bullet for the production of energy source, and that there is no a deadly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Development of facilities producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment, using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group Areva testifies to the complementarity of energy resources.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the event of a nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France we have a State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts rigorous and transparent monitoring of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new power plants in flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, they have the idea of security in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="33">Met the nuclear industry three serious accidents in fifty years.</seg>
<seg id="34">One remained in three pleasantly Iceland occurred in normal traffic conditions and without human victims, and the consequences for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Chernobyl drama created the concept of the reactor and no human error.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters the unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will take the lessons learned from this accident, just as it did in the two previous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities on nuclear safety, and designers is that type of reactor operators EPR is a concept of the capable of resisting such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While all candidates who want to build a nuclear power plant, to see it, to stop its construction in the flamanville would be a great gift nabídnutým competitors of the Areva EDF and relaxation of the travel and companies the opportunity to seize the lead in the nuclear development.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is necessary and legitimate energy to find the best solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let that emotion, dogmas and schemes have come to dominate the debate as key to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is a burden for the economy of immigration or chance?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the area of immigration policy pursued for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - overloading the police, the courts and the administration subjected policy numbers make this policy to the status "of the country of human rights," which France boast.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently, it was the administrative harassment, whose object were foreign students, which has become the current when Interior Minister - see the newspaper Libération on 23 May - said that France "does not need foreign talent, zedníky and servírky."</seg>
<seg id="4">But so far has been rarely rozebírána under úhlem economies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It must be said that in this area are quite broad agreement between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac gave his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million immigrant workers," and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990, said that France "can not take all the misery of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the level of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, was the fear of invasion hord Polish plumbers on French territory obvious in on both the right and the left.</seg>
<seg id="9">In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden on the economy and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference lies in the level of generosity that uráčíme immigrants provide.</seg>
<seg id="11">François Hollande in its programme is limited to banalities, when sales, a development that will solve our 'migration problem. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem is perhaps in the elections, economically, but it is very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As economists that resemble Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published work syntetizujícím the latest knowledge about immigration - Exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 Str.: there is broad consensus among specialists migratory movements on the positive impact on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that immigrants are taking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reducing immigration is crippling and harmful to the employment growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace the French workers, especially those less qualified, and create downward pressure on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants by much more than náhradníky for French workers by doing work in sectors with a lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">Few skilled immigrants in sectors that nepřitahují French workers, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough supply of jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Positive impact on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As well as the surgeon will have difficulties with the work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesteziologů, this addition between French and migrants are that příchody immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni peri have calculated that growth of migratory movements by 1% will trigger a rise in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And at the same time, does not take into account the fact that the diversity of přinášená Immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth - a high proportion naturalizovaných immigrants between us, the Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, the paypal eBay immigrants and Yahoo are based.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Migrants are also net contributors to the social systems in European countries for an average of 1% of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">The World Organization work in Germany, for example, estimates that one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring for their whole life to public finances net contribution - revenue minus spending - with the explosive power of the euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy's desire to be at the start of his mandate for the missing percent growth "with vyceněnými teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">Said it intended to deter immigrants have just the opposite effect.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, to properly celebrate this event.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, last Tuesday, new gas pipeline, which under the sea link directly to Russia and Germany.</seg>

<seg id="8">Other pipelines, which needs to be completed at the end of the 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the amount of consumption, which is equivalent to the whole of the French.</seg>
<seg id="9">And there is already a possibility to third pipeline gas pipeline on the same route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Victory for Gazprom is timely completion of this huge construction in nature.</seg>
<seg id="11">Against the highly protestovalo Poland and the Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nord Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany without, in fact, that it would be conducted after the country a third State - Poland or Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Together these two countries are somewhat to power: the opportunity to press Russia on threats that they will turn off access to Western European markets, it is becoming more difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most expressed it Warsaw, if not hesitate compared Nord Stream to the "new německo-sovětskému pact" with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in the 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">It means to say that this is a politically sensitive issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe through their support for the Russian project in it gained greater certainty of their purchases.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is at the cost of undermining Europe's energy, because the Project has created a schism between the Europeans from the East and the West.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has barely five years ago to push through his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose deposits are coming to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, the new tepna, confirmed that connects us organically," Francois Fillon in the formal opening of the pipeline and demonstrated, at which point, the gas contracts are both political and economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All this explains the broad smiles leaders present in large numbers in the lubminu Gazprom gas přívodním place.</seg>

<seg id="26">It was important to also increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The pipeline is long metallic had associated as 242 eiffelovek that suspended for its entire length is nowhere nor the valves, maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">One control plošina should be built in the vicinity of Sweden, but it rejected the project, although the Swedes were a little chtiví see the Russian civil society, how to permanently trapped on the coast.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the case of flaws halt to gas for less than 1 minute," clarifies the Jens Müller.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Outside control of the pipeline carries out an robot, fueled by ships, while vnitřek pipeline is controlled by machine, which cirkuluje inside.</seg>
<seg id="33">This equipment doutníkového shape on average 1 meter is introduced into vnitřku pipes and population has found itself pushed gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">In goal during three days of travel at the speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information on the potential of deformacích metal parts.</seg>
<seg id="35">Dálkový pipeline is designed to operate 50 years without it, in order to be any correction.</seg>
<seg id="36">Circulation of the gas is simply to pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">Value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies to implement this project joined forces.</seg>
<seg id="39">Leading position remains of Gazprom, which holds 51% share.</seg>
<seg id="40">It joined a German company E.ON and BASF 15,5% each, as well as the French and Dutch society gasunie group GDF Suez - 9% each.</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream charge of construction and operation of the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">Business is located in the city of zoug in Switzerland, where it is extremely favourable taxation.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom, the company has leased out for five years, all of which can be obnovována, its capacity for the transport of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will truly be a profit out of a total capacity, whether it is the amount of gas dopravovaného any," clarifies the Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Financing the construction of a gas pipeline has been secured from the 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="47">For a group of GDF Suez and some investment costs rose to 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But minority shareholders are sure that their costs to come back, because of the risk it takes only Gazprom.</seg>
