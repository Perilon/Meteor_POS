<seg id="11">But our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and perhaps would have just for a change should be referred to Libyjcům.</seg>
<seg id="12">Actually, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors took on help from infidel dogs.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sorry, it is only that, from their perspective, NATO air raids followed a General from America, but Allah, the size of each povedeném celebrated intervention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">So, when looking for winners in Libya, the West is among them.</seg>
<seg id="15">We took part in the shootings, they served Islam and our politicians in the person of the dictator to get rid of a political ally, without guarantee a profit.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">He must be a good psychologist, says the pros</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the opening article about how to teach stylists, I'm a bit postěžovala that the initial hours were a lot.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had no idea, what will follow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lectures of three professionals in the field, dress, troubled characters and a seminar about how it goes on set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even if the course is being held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "tight".</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we're discussing with the Director from Alice (in the exchange rate is not the only boy), how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly shapely figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And such is the vast majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone has a short neck, somebody's boy's figure without a sturdy set of curves, and someone's overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">He must know how to visually soften broad shoulders, to extend the neck or deliver the required curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We got so tips for women-Jennifer Lopez, larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, figure pretty stressed and wife neobléknout too.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">For example, if the difference between the waist and hips, skirts or pants really doesn't fit, then it pays to have made at least one such piece.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly you won't regret it, because the perfectly good Plaid dress is priceless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the skirt to the peace you feel much better than the one that you are constantly shifting, vyhrnuje, it's loose in the waist and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Boys ' character, he can afford to wear clothes with řasením, applications, embroidery, or in making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Such information, and the types of characters is of course much, so I'm glad I've got a whole week to get all the information in my head look.</seg>
<seg id="18">And anyway, I'm afraid that due to the specified domestic task is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the kurzistek, she is assigned a celebrity that has come up with two outfity: daily and evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and the type of the character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I'll be the "dress" Miranda Kerrovou, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the spirit of it, for me personally, definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained maybe a hundred pounds (Bert, please recognize the retelling), or young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Outfits we have to abstain from magazines or search on the Internet and print and graphically processed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moodboard, as the entire result says, then express our personal style and the relationship to the graphics rendering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Think about the graphic page styling down is important.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had to wear only physically, but also, for example, of the so-called product page in magazines (to a specific type, such as trends in handbags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">He told us about it, and the designer Mario Stonemason.</seg>
<seg id="28">But until Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He must have a general overview of the</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturday Lecture a loaded information about the types of figures of the movement three guests from the scope.</seg>
<seg id="31">He Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and he should be able to take advantage of.</seg>
<seg id="33">And handsome he can work with one piece of clothing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Variability in this case is crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So a trenčkot (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) could wear classic across the jeans and t-shirt as a cloak, but you can get dressed and naked body, dressing up in high heels and photographed as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just roll up your sleeves or collars and now the whole look looks different.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Play with it," he emphasized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But mostly, I appreciate the following advice: "to work you need to perfectly know the rules."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Then you can start to break," said James.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, it is clear to me, why are all these propositions, sliced with the combine, what, why, when, in fashion magazines, sometimes we see something else.</seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention about the shows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to photographer Ben again, I know that he must have prepared much more variants of clothes than they are taking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="43">So fashion story, which will have ten parties (ten outfitů), I have to be ready to "nastajlovat" at least fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And that in the picture the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of sometimes quite differently than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With it we have to create the outfitu count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and style is sometimes up to half of success, we confirmed the Honza Pokorný.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna, which is not just a singer, but image and marketing from her world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic's approach to the use of the services of stylists, rather cold.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even familiar faces it can be construed as useless (it's something I can do, that's how I look at it, it is secondary).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if someone from us leaves create the styling, then we expect that the US is likely to nadiktuje a completely different (smaller) size than it really is.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then do googlovat and see if the tabloids writing about the celebrity ztoustla/lost weight and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">John and Mario on Sunday, put us on the heart, that is not enough stylistovi in fashion and know how to piece together outfits.</seg>
<seg id="53">Their work primarily communicates with human beings, which dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">To be able to assess people, nepodbízet, state your opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"If you a Manager to protřídili her wardrobe and complete it on Nice pieces, so you can't wear the whole case and say, my God, this is terrible."</seg>
<seg id="56">"Find there at least a few things pochválíte and recommend what they wear," says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He also specifically pointed to what it must contain a so-called "placovka", or "bag on the set.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's the one that turns around the waist and have all the necessary paraphernalia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, roller on the hair or pins, there are also silonová yarn (with her he helps out in the photo products such as handbags or hats), special just clips, which we clip the clothes in the back, if it is more (a PIN or other staple are not admissible, damaging the garment), or sewing kit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">We just didn't listen, but also virtually anything, but we have learned how to properly podlepit shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even in a photo shoot at the Studio, where the flat surface, the foot may harm, let alone outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And so we're stuck and stuck.</seg>
<seg id="63">Scissors bot we can't even touch that happens to be damaging.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is therefore really need skill.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario me when my baby without reservations.</seg>
<seg id="66">Mentioned skill are not my friend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is just a tiny fraction of what we talk about the second weekend the continuation rate hearing.</seg>
<seg id="68">I'm getting more and more clear that attending styling down on professional level really isn't a cakewalk, says who wants what it wants.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Need for Speed: The Run, the race across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reviews</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Originally, the rider is a series of completely unnecessary on sloppy mistakes in a routine early morning trip to shift.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ambitions are to a large extent to fill, but it's not valid, if no one apparently didn't want to do anything extra.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">New episode: The Run attracted before the release of high expectations.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised that the venerable racing series Need for Speed, once again, moves a new direction and the playable demos appeared as a game, which, in the genre of racing might not be just the number.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, we were wondering how they inserted passages in which the main character gets out of the car and will take place on foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As for the NFS series is custom, many of them in the result a little differently than we expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's potentially decent arcaded races, but a whole runs down some unnecessary errors that appear in the series are more or less already for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So it's actually not errors, but rather a sign of some sort of incomprehensible laziness of developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">You are introduced to the story, the main hero Jack has certain problems of a personal nature, and as a solution offers participation in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">Behind the wheel recline on the West Coast in San Francisco and your task is to reach the first in New York City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea has some interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into ten stages, and then to more than fifty plants.</seg>
<seg id="16">It follows that every race on the other line and the stages are integrated into different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Man does not have a feeling that the game was always the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some of the environment are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponding to the previous parts of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it's nothing to write home about.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the ride across the desert, autumn landscape, or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The races are, in addition, from time to time some zpestřeny the unusual element.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the desert, for example, přimotáte in the sand storm, which significantly reduces the visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">By contrast, in the mountains again, you must be careful not to nezasypala you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, they are quite good for a planted rather individual races.</seg>
<seg id="25">While it is only a few types, but it's enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">A moment so you're trying to pass the required number of opponents (basically the classic race), then our gaining on them time (a classic duel with peduncles), and then you must duel with a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">It still gets from time to time and the police, which all your efforts even further znepříjemňuje.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Novelty are the passages out of the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rather, it is just such an interactive animation, when Jack majority before someone running and you must help him, in the correct order you are printing the correct buttons.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Surprised, however, that these passages is in the game much less than you'd expect (more specifically, maybe even only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, but it is to the benefit of things, because this element has no chance to become a nuisance and in the context of the above said is one of the elements that the game by.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Driving model is following in the footsteps of the previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that it's certainly not a big deal, but you can't say that would be a big drawback.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But akčněji pojatému racing its bicycles model meets the still quite well, although we could find better competitors.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, everything in perfect order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the problems are beginning to appear after some time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the model schedule was too fine is not a model of the collision.</seg>
<seg id="40">From games of this type don't expect that counts the complex deformation and collision, but practically before no impact to any object, you do not have the faintest idea how to maintain your car, then it probably is not quite all right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typically, when a succession of overtaking or passing other cars in normal operation is sometimes only slightly cooked each other, but sometimes in a nearly identical situation then your car in feral piruetách.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even straight to smithereens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the restartů system, while it's not particularly mind, but you get it reliably.</seg>
<seg id="44">Restarts are designed so that if the smashing or go far out of line, you play back to latest landmark on the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the restartů is available in each race only five.</seg>
<seg id="46">When is a space, you must race to start again from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is, rather, a widget for the case that something does not than you could rely on them exclusively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">But sometimes restarts do not help you, will need to learn is the section of the ex-works from memory.</seg>
<seg id="49">The big game there is that the same things often happen in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some of the curves, for example, the need to ride in a specific way, or simply not enough room in them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sometimes you meet on the "civilian" trucks always in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, pátí, about five seconds or a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">It sucks, in particular in situations where you can see how the opponent between two protijedoucími cars in front of you easily passes, while when you get there, you are already the wagons in a position that you have to detour around or slow down.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is one thing when you get to them, because it is a "calculated" to a given situation there is always just before your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents also have another advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">For the entire period of play you'll find several places where you, again without regard to time, always pass the same opponent on the same site.</seg>
<seg id="56">Most hits in the conclusion of the game on a long bridge, where you're going the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="57">Opponent must get there before you, apparently, perhaps at any price.</seg>
<seg id="58">Coming from you, so you are getting worse overview of protijedoucích wagons, so initially I guess a couple of pretty rozmašírujete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I can understand the intention to make the game exciting and adrenalinovější, but the implementation is so clear that you can reliably get frustrated quickly.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it's a shame, because, despite the simple combination of model is acting funny and action so that sometimes literally can't follow track, where everything goes.</seg>
<seg id="61">And is essentially one, whether it is the concept with 49 unique lines, sort of plants, so that boredom would have no chance, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must watch out for the gas station for journeys, because that is where you can change the car, although in most cases perfectly with what you have now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Convertibles are suitable to the urban areas, a strong America we love you on the highway straight and exotic supersporty technical riding, for example, after the winding mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">With the main příběhovým regime goes hand in hand and the mode of the challenges, which are races in each of the locations that you know from the story.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here you not only medals but also experience points to your profile, which is common for the call and the story.</seg>
<seg id="68">In order to obtain a higher level driver to unlock the various subjects: starting with the cars and ending with the backgrounds for profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is also once again linked with on-line features Autolog, which, inter alia, compares your results with other players, and provides other community features.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the more difficult the situation is understandable kicks from the last race in the story.</seg>
<seg id="71">With your car to get to the Metro tunnel (so be it), where it's going in the dark on the tracks (so be it).</seg>
<seg id="72">On the tacho you are flashing numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (so be it) and someone in the rear set of Metro and uncompromising was instalation you.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the Newsroom about us even for a few days will hold discussions on whether to create the games really nobody even thought about it, or whether the authors are really so great.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical elements of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.</seg>
<seg id="75">Start praying for mercy so that in certain moments in the vypjatějších falls, and in some cases quite tragic.</seg>
<seg id="76">This concerns especially car crashes with a larger number of participants, which would give you continuous imagery there was just nothing valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Audio page is in order, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In an effort to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audience was the soundtrack from category "Motley", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music a game just about anyone to buy it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game committing herself completely unnecessary errors, then we are not afraid to say that The Run the best NFS share for the last several years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But as the game is nedodělaně.</seg>
<seg id="82">Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared that you will třískat into the eyes of errors by airport lights.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Brand story:</seg>
<seg id="2">IBM begins second century innovator of its existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If someone was looking for the word that most closely expressed the strategy of IBM, the closest would probably be "long-term".</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public is the IBM symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, yet since its formation had already passed a hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this dlouhodobosti laid the first boss of the firm, a visionary Thomas j. Watson SR.</seg>
<seg id="6">He coined the password that a number of the world's problems can be easily solved, if people are willing to think.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His motto, "Think!", so the imprint, which will depend on the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine that IBM had begun in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">It was also the basis for Watson carefully built corporate culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">"For us from IBM means long-term thinking, continuous movement toward the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and prospered, a hundred years because they remained loyal to its basic values and yet afraid everything else around them change.</seg>
<seg id="11">It allowed us during our first centuries transform technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second round, we can achieve more, "he said to the anniversary of the current Director of the Samuel j. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Sophisticated system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson in the 1930s had to take care of their employees as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic-people from IBM had as one of the first American workers paid vacation, insurance from an employer, plus an elegant employee uniform, and a sophisticated system of remuneration of the best inventors, and traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">As detailed in the IBM i has a relationship with the customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was from the beginning a genius in the extraction of talent-as one of the first international firms to abolish any discrimination, so that you could choose from.</seg>
<seg id="17">In accordance with the strategy of anti-discrimination is the current plan that Palmisana at the head of IBM in the next year would be followed by a woman-Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">The IBM Act already thirty years, still holds the position of boss of sales, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in recent years is the so-called jams, on-line brainstormingy, from which there is a lot of future strategies and innovation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not surprisingly, ideas is enough-in the company works almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Institutions with a good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">A fixed position in business provides the company a strong internal and external image.</seg>
<seg id="23">"From the beginning, the institution should IBM concept rather than just technology firms," she said Economistu Professor of Harvard Business School and author of books about Rosabeth Moss Kanter of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but the company, which helps to solve business problems for the use of technology," said George Colony from the consulting firm Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the name itself says, is the difference between the market and the market right to create.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM-or "big blue" her because of her logo in the United States, familiarly nicknamed-one hundred years grew into one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is probably the most versatile technological company-develops hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting, and consulting services in the range of products from servers for nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">Holds the most patents from all u.s. technology businesses and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her inventions include ATM, credit card, financial swap, bar code or a floppy disk.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year to become the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, surpassed Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking forward</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovation they taste customers and periods of-IBM, for example, did not work the bet on their own operating system, OS/2, the on-line service Prodigy or the IBM PCjr.</seg>
<seg id="33">"If your business built on the movement forward, you cannot emotionally can tie up the past," poznamává to Samuel j. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM does not have problem to build its foundations on many platforms-and if not, then leave.</seg>
<seg id="35">The difference should be from the competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Perspective technologies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the sales of IBM, the largest share of services, after roughly a fifth of it consists of software and hardware.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yet in 1990 with more than half the share of the most powerful representative of the hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $ 15 billion, during the same period it has invested $ 58 billion to purchase prospective technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the investment continues from 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM is acting according to a reference of its first head of the Thomas j. Watson, who, during the great depression, also increased the volume of investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis intact.</seg>
<seg id="43">IBM'S share price since the beginning of 2008 increased by 120 percent, rocket net profit the company is continually growing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Corporate password IBM is changing everything, only their values.</seg>
<seg id="45">It can therefore be expected that even if the came another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM: from the toilet of cheese after years in space</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City, a hundred years ago, originally had a complicated name of the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The name IBM took over until in 1924-originally it was a tag used for the branch companies in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The basis for the later IBM gave the merger the four firms, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.</seg>
<seg id="50">Owning the technology, such as the famous "píchačky," then hours afterwards, the employee can record the arrival and departure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who in 1930, also chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint has hired the chief rival of Thomas j. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">Leader of then were overshadowed by the founder of the IBM-at Watsonových thought is not yet built the advantage corporate culture and identity.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the company until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of machines for business-from kráječů of meat and cheese after the Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years, what Watson headed the company, doubled turnover to nine million dollars and began a large expansion of the company in all continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson has been indispensable for the company so that after almost 40 years in the šéfovském Chair, it was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to manage flights into space-on mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man on the moon.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the meantime, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers-a series of IBM System/360.</seg>
<seg id="61">Classic "pécéčko," which raised the computer standard, since named IBM 5150 it came on the market in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers, Lenovo, the Chinese company bought the konzultantskou part of the firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote advice and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, which in the last three years, IBM paid-is the concept of a Smarter Planet, "smarter planet".</seg>
<seg id="64">Its aim is the clever use of technology not yet even unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport, or administration of the cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">For the area of trade, introduced recently, the IBM platform "Smarter" Commerce ", which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a strong history in the territory of the country.</seg>
<seg id="67">Its branch founded in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, in addition to IBM CZECH REPUBLIC also operates the Centre of strategic outsourcing in Brno.</seg>
<seg id="69">Center for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How have the prices of tours since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 it was in what was then Czechoslovakia allowed only five State-owned travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM.XML, Recreational and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies at that time were sold in the overwhelming majority of only trips to countries of Socialist bloc, as travelling to the West was very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists as they traveled on a vacation to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A clear exception was the period from 1962 until 1972, when it was able to to travel to Yugoslavia, but the Yugoslavian regime brought to the West and the Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The great paradox of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the Socialist block (i.e., also Czechoslovakians) allowed to travel freely, either individually or in the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the event that a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, so he needed a letter of invitation from this country, not otherwise individual path, maybe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The travel agency at the time, offering package tours to the West, however, was the need to queue overnight with sleeping or in the travel agency "known good".</seg>
<seg id="9">Not so, however, not the end.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called foreign exchange the promise, which was a condition for the journey to the West, was not granted "politically unreliable" people "who could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Czechoslovak currency is not freely convertible currency, without foreign exchange promise so it was not possible to obtain financial resources (Western currency) on journey to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">By far the most common, however, the Czechs spent a vacation in the country, of which the result was a large number of huts and cottages, which the Czechs to take and this custom survives to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Travelling Czechs so experienced since 1989, a real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While in the year 1989 was a vacation in EAST GERMANY or Bulgaria to our maximum, the Czechs spent abroad last year 4.5 miles. holidays in countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A great paradox that you already realize today is that the US is currently most popular in Croatia was not possible until 1989 travel freely, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">At the outset, 90. years of the last century following the abolition of the visa requirement to neighbouring West European countries, which was triggered by a huge surge in short-term visits Vienna Austria or Germany in particular.</seg>
<seg id="17">They couldn't get enough of czechoslovakians long trips to the West, each with at least wanted to see for a while.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris, sleeping in parks tours of Czechs in tents, as our former income were, so we can pay the hotel or guesthouse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of the travel of Czechs was by this time vození their own food, cans, salami, etc, to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible of the Czech Crown, giving our visitors could finally after many years of destítkách freely to buy Western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and average wages rose, however, which resulted in around 1997, another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began regularly since 1997 to prepare tours Charter air services, air tours, thanks to options nasmlouvat quantity discounts in comparison with the past, incredibly had become cheaper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the late 1990s. years of the last century had already the Czechs enjoyed virtually all developed countries in the world, except the US, which continue to facilitate our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when he was due to the large demand, dispatched from the Czech Republic, historically the first direct charter flight to the touch, it was in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">From this year so every year vylétávají with Czech tourists spot charters to warm lands, this year's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic into 12 exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Exotic countries currently visiting already around 100 thousand Czechs per year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-Orange, came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">17. November 2008, abolished the U.S. visas for Czech tourists and thereby our country finally became the most advanced country in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, for the first time in the history of the Czechs also spent more than half their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in the history of it spent on one foreign holiday, including the cost of the place of residence of more than 15 000. USD per person.</seg>

<seg id="1">The general meeting has to find the President, again, but threatens to stalemate</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months is a Czech football without the President and there is a risk that the successor Ivan Haška led the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Still, there is no agreement, according to which the electoral regulations shall be followed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without it, neither does not vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="5">Interest to lead Czech football to Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hasek resigned from Office in June and, in his retirement called colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in an era when Haškovi football slid back toward tit-svazovými between the two chambers, which are unable to agree on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Full it showed 16. September, when a new President was to be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates of the general meeting to the National House in Prague-Smíchov left unnecessarily, because the negotiations remain blocked, and it wasn't just on the way to elections.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is not a consensus, who has the right to vote, actually-if only the statutory representatives or officials of the credentials, full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At this one point since there was a partial match, which was helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">Disputes but still exist in the electoral regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Too clear to the situation of the nevnesl, or the Executive Committee, at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, does not, in essence, nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="14">Look at the option of several times changed, but neuralgický the point is still the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to handle 3. bike, to eliminate the possibility of stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda in the leadership of the Association represents professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round to win one of the candidates, which will have a greater percentage of support in the Chamber, for which he's running.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is reportedly willing to go to the concession, to win the candidate who receives the higher the sum of the percent of the vote from both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Czech party promotes the condition that the winner must, when this percentage addition to obtain at least two-thirds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"But it would then make sense and she lost the two previous rounds, that would be completely refuted by the bicameral concept" understands the objections of the Moravian parties Freedom according to which would be the best regulations don't stem and vote under the applicable statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With the somewhat surprisingly agrees and Tomáš Paclík, although it is estimated that the statutes specified the electoral regulations of the suits of all candidates most of the Pelt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I wish that voted for the maximum according to the articles of Association."</seg>
<seg id="23">"To nevymýšlely some wildcard nonsense as at the last general meeting," said the owner of the Victoria Plzeň, who's running for the first time, and in its observations, explaining, in particular, against the Pelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him, in Nymburk, the new Chairman, I know and believe that the candidates together constructively in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">"All passion calms down, where today's procedure for the national team at the European Championships."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Football will be again happy wave, it will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says jablonecký and former, who is from across the three largest experience in the management of football at both the professional and the regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is nearing.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope in an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is a lot of ambivalent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt to the rules.-assigned"</seg>
<seg id="31">"This may cause it to stop the general meeting again."</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that sanity will prevail," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">To the agreement of all parties have much time left.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some of the negotiations was allegedly happen directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the struggle will football ever complete the generals.</seg>
<seg id="35">The air special, in which they move to Podgorica, inter alia, Vice-Chairman of Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, namely from Prague because of technical failure in the morning takes off and looking for the replacement option, as part of the Executive Committee to the scene barážové retaliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Finally, maybe it will be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, which might be alleged on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Minister of education, youth and sports of Josef Telecommunication would like to persuade riven by the parties within the strongest sporting association in the country, to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the game's a lot: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which will address the new direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík goes into battle for the President, because they see a suitable candidate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the Chief players in the grounds of Tomáš Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor should the fight Summit function.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If the quality of the adept existed, I'm fighting for it, and I'm not going into the elections."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the current situation, unable to find anyone like that," said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In a duel with Miroslav Peltou and Henry Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Pelt, alleged by him, he tried to avoid in the way to the head of FAČR.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also stresses that, in the case of his victory, in the role of the President lasted only until 2013, which is on the agenda of the annual general meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the long run would like to see an experienced and award winning Manager, who is not too linked with a football game.</seg>
<seg id="46">"With some of the people who would come into consideration, I'm talking about."</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me it was crazy, some say that at this point, with the Czech football or do not want to be identified."</seg>
<seg id="48">"That I'd like to change, '' he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Paclíkovi was now most of all do Peltovo conjunction with the Chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association by Romano Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation, which is in the wings known as powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates to the general meeting.</seg>
<seg id="50">For the Paclíka is so unacceptable that stood in the Chair position Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If he won, so zakonzervuje the current state of and nothing would move forward in football."</seg>
<seg id="52">"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled trader, would help the football even more," said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Referring to that Peltovo name years ago there was a corruption in the eavesdropping when investigating the affair, but from which Pelta went unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I don't know what kind of prestige would football Peltovo the victory."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And how would we also looked in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, but it also takes the perspective of his former statement that it would "sell plzeňský Club if Pelta became Chairman".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the event that Paclík in the Thursday election triumphs, but could with Peltou imagine future cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="57">The same is another candidate Rajchl, which Paclík is supported before the general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (Pelta) would have been the first who I'd go."</seg>
<seg id="59">"He has great ability."</seg>
<seg id="60">"I could see him as head of the team."</seg>
<seg id="61">"But this would drive the Association."</seg>
<seg id="62">"I also don't stick your nose where it can't do it," said Paclík, who in September raised much attention by standing behind the Commission citing the arbitration with the Luďkem Macelou, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík says that it would take over the management of the Association dared.</seg>
<seg id="64">Refers to the ability of management to private companies since last summer's also Plzeň, which with its support in May was celebrated by the premiérový League triumph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the strength to make it in the football environment, something has changed, so has contributed to its particular culture."</seg>
<seg id="66">"To reduce the effects of certain interest groups, which should tend to influence disciplinary and appeals to the Commission, which goes up to the unsavoury situations," said Paclík, who expresses his dislike for example for sparťanskému boss Daniel Křetínskému.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">One of the priorities should also considered tightening the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose use would be for political leaders lobbying for the sport received more money from the lottery tax.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It is one of the key things that should be the new Chairman."</seg>
<seg id="69">"If the taxation of gambling, how to declare political party, so I understand their reasoning, but must say where the money will go," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A Paclík now its not even associated with the Plzeň Club, even though he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is associated with Jabloncem, with the Prague Duklou. Rajchl</seg>
<seg id="72">"It's not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">"I can't see but no sense to someone clinging convert their shares in the Club and a year and a half there," says Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised the new statutes FAČR, which would eliminate the electoral stalemate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, intends to have FAČR the new statutes, which would, in future, definitely avoid disputes over the election regulations.</seg>
<seg id="76">Jablonecký is official before Thursday's meetings in Nymburk optimist and believes that the election fight significantly dampen any of today's success of the football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta is now been made the choice promised that the representation and acquisition Finance intends to concentrate in the case of the election.</seg>
<seg id="78">The choice before the last general meeting decided to go at the last minute, and he two-month postponement of the throw to their ideas about the management of football, he defended and presented in a broader context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"The people at all levels make football a long time and they expect that the President will be known on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="80">"Feels that it is high time that the Association leadership," says the man, who is associated in particular with the jabloneckým Club, but a number of years he worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="81">I, therefore, believes that he has enough experience to Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Is convinced that the current problems with the choice is euphoria, which was at the time the Government of Ivan Haška.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting approved the statutes, which were not as perfect as everybody thought."</seg>
<seg id="84">"If Númenor did not permit different interpretations, the President we've had since September," said Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Just processing the most important document of the Civic Association began as a vějičku delegate.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I become President, I'll take it as a personal challenge, and I'm willing to take personal responsibility, if it fail."</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot be," says Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Next they try to nevymezovat against their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">Earlier avizoval that he could imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchlem, which recognizes for its forensic education, and knows that his opponent was its first Vice-President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">Long neútočil and Thomas Paclíka, who, on the contrary, to let the thread of dried Pelt.</seg>
<seg id="91">"In football, something over a year, has had some success."</seg>
<seg id="92">"However, his attacks were unworthy of him and a lot of people in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"And so many of them now has doubts about its actual nature," he said to the man who supposedly Pelta address remains faithful to the proklamacím, which had already announced in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competition after representation.</seg>
<seg id="95">This should be a showcase of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"And I also tried to close all the Affairs, starting with the case of Bohemians or echoes of last year's corruption scandal."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Then I went to the negotiations with the private and public sectors, to make enough money for the whole of football," said the candidate, 46, two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">If also promised that his arrival was to head the football would be no staff purges.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I'd have to first get acquainted with the contents of the individual employees," said David at Strahov, where the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.</seg>

<seg id="101">"If it is the only contentious point, how will be elected in the third round, so that we can migrate."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Soccer needs credibility, there will only be finally have again their leader," remains Pelta two days before the possibly decisive on his funkcionářské career optimist.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When knitting for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass Hall, bold strokes and new building materials, which are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of architect Charles Schwanzera for the Brussels World Exposition 1958 concise and its celebrated example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzerův Pavilion received when the Grand Prix d ' Architecture for its light and they towered, active construction of steel and glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Best known as an architect, so that also for the next World Expo Pavilion built in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="10">With its legendary čtyřválcovým BMW-Palace plus as a key carried out minor building in Munich, eventually 1973 internationally famous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its as a temporary exhibition structure designed Pavilion for the World Exposition placed in the Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern train station), and have recreated in 1962 opened the Museum of 20. century-was named as "the House of 20. of the century ".</seg>
<seg id="12">Appropriate for the museum building was not used, or spatially nor technically-lacking the walls for hanging up art exhibits, no satisfactory climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yet it was used until the current art yet in Vienna of the new stand.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001 the building was empty and deteriorate more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz Pavilion in an instant, is now the name of "the House of 21. of the century "and will in future be used as the Museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday night there opens the Museum Belvedere Palace, to which it belongs, the first exhibition-happy intention in every respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Entrepreneurship new start Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new Director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, art historian with a significant name králová career, m. j. figure skater in his youth, and later in Sotheby 's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding Director of the Museo modernism Salzburg, pushed strongly for the reconstruction of the politicians and preservationists, sought public funding and private sponsorship money and identified uses.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to the contemporary art should be posted on the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruby restaurant of the foundations, should there be a café and bookshop, and had to be built to the Office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Close supervision, low budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the implementation was then Krischanitz ideal cast.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only that, sensitively reconstructed them and spread of Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbricha in Vienna, and won the competition, but because, at the Schwanzera, he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was extremely important for him to "place" in which "almost every weekend" at the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the original project, and also knew problems building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and the change of use of lost to its generosity and lightness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reconstruction were far bigger problems: the building was "Catapult problems for energy," says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">Window profiles, glass facades have been exchanged, used glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced by special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Chladové bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos filled ceilings rescued.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two underground floors provide space for new uses, flush mounted lighting channel between the building and the street lighting, handles to the entrance leads to the bridge-almost new construction, but still vznosný Schwanzerův Pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original entrance door, the building is preserved in the old natřena anti-corrosive červenohnědém color tone.</seg>
<seg id="29">And is exactly the same as he was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it's all under strict supervision of the heritage and the low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often had to be found of the material which is good and cheap, and also liked the památkovému Office," says Krischanitz and points to a broken floor basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction of the building remained flexible and airy.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's difficult to be with Pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," he said recently, the typical "Krischanitz Drop-in-the-City-History".</seg>
<seg id="34">Such architecture he is "always in the wrong place" and wants to still "give proper self-esteem."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, but it is not the House of 21. the century nepatřičném the spot since most urban happy coincidence: in radius around Schweizer Garten is a completely newly designed "Urban neighborhood at the main station" with Office and residential houses.</seg>
<seg id="36">And perhaps even to another happy coincidence: the House of 21. century could receive aid from other Krischanitzovy buildings, as the lover of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how to hear, this is with the city of the neighbourhood at in Schweizer Garten.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Scandalous Bank in Zürichsee</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Most Bank, Europe does not have a registered office in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">UBS has suffered a financial crisis almost bankrupt, and since then, sliding from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it has some German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So the Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his retirement from the leadership of the noisy Federal Bank happened in July known that arrives 2013 to almost the same spektakulárního a new job: President of the Management Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS-unexpected and lucrative step in his career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber had publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired respectability and said the friendly remarks towards future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Die UBS its turnover".</seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to working with Kasparem Villigerem and Oswald Grübelem".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September it was clear that everything goes differently.</seg>
<seg id="11">One dealer from UBS in London, walked around all the security systems of the Bank and approximately 1.7 billion euro zmarnil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">The President of the Board of UBS is since then also stunned-and they all ask: When finally coming Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I already have known that Weber Bank from February 2012 may advise.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the Presidency of the Administrative Council takes over in may-not only in the year 2013, the Bank informed on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber will be hard.</seg>
<seg id="17">Is not a banker, Professor of Economics and major banker and he would certainly have time to incorporate needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time will take over then the responsibility for the strategy of the Bank, who once again has proved that he deserves the title "Bank of the largest scandals in Europe"</seg>
<seg id="19">Because UBS is both great-until recently was the largest asset manager in the world-and sliding in both years from one scandal to the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, will not remain proud of the Swiss Bank was spared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started as a financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Image of the quiet, and a solid, but also vychytralého Asset Manager combines with the ambitious objectives: also wanted to mean something in the investment banking business.</seg>
<seg id="24">So managed the UBS 2007 on one side with the 1.6 trillion dollars more money of wealthy clients than any other Bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on the other hand, has advanced as an investment bank, to the League's biggest banks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">It made an impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">A former banker and later a long-time Professor of banking in Zurich, Hans Geiger says: "their students I UBS claimed always as a model of good Bank."</seg>
<seg id="28">"From today's point of view, a man asks: how I could so wrong?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He was wrong considerably.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, was the first clear that something went wrong in the UBS properly.</seg>
<seg id="31">In mid boss surprisingly resigned Board of Directors Peter Wuffli, who has not been seen as highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, knew why he left.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Investment Bank Division squandered the Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To withstand a Prowler, same UBS capital increase in the amount of really 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">But actually found investors, however, over which was recently still sneered: Opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one even knew his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But that was just the first impact.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008 it developed the worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Bank had to admit the new billions in losses, the President of the Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second best paid Executive Board Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, followed by a disaster: UBS was due to its bad investments for financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the State.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs to mandatorily convertible bonds, which could be a partner in a bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whole Switzerland was shaken-as you noted, as dramatic for a small country, has on its territory the big banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">After all he was the balance sum of UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture).</seg>
<seg id="43">"Once again we could not save UBS", says Bank expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster follows another.</seg>
<seg id="45">For several months in the tax dispute capitulated UBS with America and has shown willingness to issue data, affluent customers who, if possible, with the assistance of banks've ended the tax.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, she agreed with the payment of 780 million dollars-as the recovery of irregular profits from these transactions, including, and.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">This confession, more or less openly, that helped the reduction of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in the competition for rich clients: Halo discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was previously.</seg>
<seg id="50">Followed the resignation of the head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Council.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of money customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So the Bank lost in the course of a few months, his credibility in both the central business areas: investment banking for the poor speculation and in the management of assets for aiding the reduction of taxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when things calmed down a little bit again, just as it was thought that UBS has once again recovered, here comes this unfortunate business quest: the only dealer zmarnil euro 1.7 billion before the Bank noticed that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it's clear: with the management of the risks in the investment banking it probably still isn't working.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"Case of Adoboli probably found that control risks has too few", says Martin Janssen, an economist and a Professor of finance at Banking Finanz Institute of the University of Zürich, Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="56">The Financial Director of a large German bank is certain: "the problem of UBS lies in the fact that it doesn't control the risks."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was exactly her idea of the precautionary principle, which got off on the Swiss Bankers have long ago to become guard big properties of the world: none too great a risk, but security for the money-also from the parties of the Alpine Republic collapsed the world again.</seg>
<seg id="58">Vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol for steadfast reliability as the Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Headquarters for UBS in Zurich, to cliché good Swiss private banks-it is just a little bigger.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's a classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its main office in Zurich, Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyšskému Lake, which is backed by snow-capped Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops, among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Jewelry, such as Tiffany 's, here they find between the Swiss traditional trades such as ice Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries houses the Swiss banks: from the Nationalbank via Palast der Credit Suisse to an elite private banks as Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the reception hall you enter the UBS heavy otáčivými the door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside the walls are panelled in marble, in front of them is a huge leather chairs, in addition to the Bank's logo, a large signpost to "safe".</seg>
<seg id="67">UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of Swiss banks both by the Swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes-curb or betrayed, how determined the boss of a small Swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name would prefer to read in the papers, he concluded, like all Swiss Bankers, also with the two velkobankami shops.</seg>
<seg id="70">UBS is probably too grown, primarily detect in investment banking, where, moreover, extend the Anglo-saxons.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss, it do not have more to tell.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And if you had to adapt to the Anglo-Saxon ways."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Actually, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS has doomed her high profits and then disaster: no European financial Institute lost in the jungle around the Subprime as much money as the Schweizer Großbank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">October 15, 2008 was a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="75">"In the center of the small coalition Government agreed to sedmimilionové the country to the greatest life-saving action in the history of his nation," writes author Lukas Hässig, in his book "Der UBS-Crash".</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, approved the politicians to save the bankruptcy standing velkobanku.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If the talks with the Swiss Bankers, the problem arises mainly in the size of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three Swiss velkobank to massive concern.</seg>
<seg id="80">The Bank, which has already resulted in a merger was too large to small Switzerland-and still further grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">While allowing that the two different banking predecessor UBS complement each other: one rich, but sleepy Bank in Zurich with a focus in management of assets and the poorer, but internationally more involved.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly they came internacionalizovaní investment bankers looking to many money, with which they could spin a roulette wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">With this rise of UBS are associated with two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group, UBS and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the person managing the feelings around the stomach, which is from Bank of science has developed a completely up."</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel was to end on Wuffliho.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wuffli and at the end of may has committed crucial errors: "I thought that its models are a reality," says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"This is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">This much is clear: the pride of the preceding fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">Employees of UBS clearly recall the meetings of executives, on which the koncernový Chief Wuffli said again and again the same password: Knock, Goldman Sachs down from the throne.</seg>
<seg id="92">American Bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">Alleged "League Tables", waiting list, which documents the success of banks during that period.</seg>
<seg id="94">It tried to UBS on the location closest to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">A few steps she had succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="96">In trade with the currency and stock market took part in the game at the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">Corporate Advisers, who were instructed to stress, however, one weakness: an interest in international trade, in the speech of the bankers "Fixed Income", I think there is a big gap for the largest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">UBS has about gaps in US mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To this gap, ventured to UBS to adventure, which almost cost her existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, invested as the Bank itself and based her Fund to ensure the risks to American Subprime investments.</seg>
<seg id="101">Developed into a massive machine that securities přebaloval on American mortgage loans and forward further-but he also kept the risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Also, when other banks had long sought a way out.</seg>
<seg id="103">"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought them, '' says a banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">How big is the euphoria and deep fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">One manager behind the other had to leave, when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Positions in UBS became a katapultovacím seat and to this day the pick fleas out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Who leads the velkobanku now has an uncontrollable work.</seg>
<seg id="108">Must find a strategy for the Bank, all of which are close to the business models were gone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banking expert Geiger has had an idea: the end to investment banking, concentration on the administration of the assets, the return of Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">Completely so far while (still) doesn't want to go.</seg>
<seg id="111">But investment banking has strong ubýt, it is now clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">Next Thursday the Bank wants new boss Sergio Ermotti introduce the world of their future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, when surprisingly broke up with predecessor Grübelem.</seg>
<seg id="114">In the meantime, pushed through: long-term lead business, UBS, said Bank Zürich on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to investment bank be restored to status in the mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">3500 posts deleted;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But this will not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is she?</seg>
<seg id="120">What he wants to earn money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions which the Axel Weber have already considered.</seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly but not only says that he and his lady, first found in the Zurich apartment.</seg>

<seg id="1">The massacre at the personal level</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Emotionally powerful new book Peter Englunda with the name of beauty and sorrow: Confidential history of the first World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of acting of characters until you make your head spin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">One of the Council, as at the moment keep: Carefully pull this page and make it a bookmark.</seg>
<seg id="4">All persons in his narrative of Mr. Englunda you very well, and this list will serve as navigation-as a lighthouse-at a time when, like the men and women in the story you feel confused and lost in different situations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is also the new Assistant at the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">The book, we talking about here, is very unusual-the author himself describes, quite presciently, as "antihistorickou work".</seg>
<seg id="8">Includes several well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, in her nearly missing Ambassador, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's not so much a book about what happened, explains the author as "a book about what it was like." Discusses mainly about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"The beauty and the sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less common men and women on both sides of the divide, from students and botanists and mountaineers, the doctors, the driver záchranek and officials.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives twinkle as the flames of candles candles in the Church-new to be added to the entanglement of the fates, while the other uhasínají.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book of Mr. Englunda from the classical historical novels are different.</seg>
<seg id="15">Modifies the idea that the first world war was just God awful zákopových fighting on the Western front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The beauty and the sorrow" deftly explores and other places, where there was a war dramas: the Alps, Balkans, Eastern front, Mesopotamia, Eastern Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book addresses the issues with the fact that they fall bee nest, it must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or the face with the presence of tse-tse flies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Almost from the beginning, it's a very touching read.</seg>
<seg id="19">War will engulf the lives of people like some kind of natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, foul-smelling gunpowder.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the shooting starts sounding in the distance from the works and you are a woman who is at home with their children, to escape or will you stay?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who's coming?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why the war was rozpoutána.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The vacuum arising from the lack of facts," noted Mr. Englund, "was filled with guesses, assumptions, expectations, fears, prejudices, konspiračními theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors are."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty and the sorrow" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmboroughová, English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are generally are taken from CVS, letters, and other already published materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Descriptions of their lives may seem frightening and fascinating, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are perfectly alive and believable.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them discusses the hardships and dealing with him.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the story of the German students author says: "Substitutes, everywhere the same substitutes."</seg>
<seg id="29">"A coffee substitute, aluminium imitation, imitation of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Goes even further and describes the substitutes meals in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mentions "mass manufactured from pressed rice cooked in the morsels of fat (and supplemented by a spoofed bone from wood), tobacco from the dried roots and dried peelings, shoes with wooden soles".</seg>
<seg id="32">Mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered substitutes coffee."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some of the stories are about honour and bravery.</seg>
<seg id="34">One American in me is the internal incentives to the savagery and brutality of war, and declares: "in the end you'll understand that this is human nature. Rather than sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening newspaper or a good book and pretend that this mask represents civilization and for the Prim I inside is no barbarian. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that with the greatest likelihood of death and nobody would notice, let alone to mourn his passing.</seg>
<seg id="36">"When you finally accept that the sacrifices, he would at least that this happens before the eyes of grateful audience," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, however, sounds like "condemned, which secretly to hang".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other remarks concerning the retirement of old Europe and the advent of new horrors.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competitive struggle," writes Mr. Englund, "the war between the factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">He caught it, what he says "a new kind of beast: the emerging century vocal and ideologically professed a serial killer in a dress cut on the peace that their blood is carried out without stood up from the table."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave unexpectedly, meanness, alternate with heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Englund describes soldiers who deliberately sought from prostitutes to catch a venereal disease, in order to avoid service on the queue.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Nejgrotesknějším an example of this behavior was trading with the gonokokovým the pus that soldiers were buying and they punished his genitals in the hope that ends up in the hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"The most desperate it's even in the eye, which is often blinded until the end of life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves is prose of Mr. Englunda speedy, but not conspicuous, which, to his great human theme.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small outputs captures the way in which war "unleashed a completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, the religious hatred".</seg>
<seg id="47">People are starting to ask why their leaders to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books on the first world war, the majority, rather than a comprehensive narrative work with signs such as "the first world war and modern memory" from Paul Fussella or novels as "quiet on the Western Front" from Erich Maria Remarquea.</seg>
<seg id="49">Mr. Englund prefers a nekonvenčnímu concept.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book has the most overwhelming in the end handpainted literature deadlocks.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, you can't tell.</seg>
<seg id="52">However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, you tore a page from the list of heroes from my hand and lit it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Unions representing hundreds of school ancillary workers who have lost their jobs last month, in the middle of planning to sue the city. Argues that the dismissal was not necessary and it was discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, visiting the poor students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Lawsuit is probably the last option, which the unions in the area of District Council 37, in their efforts to reverse the decision on layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="4">7th October lost work of the six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other staff, who were among the worst-paid employees of the city. Their release of the leading members of trade unions described as retaliation of the city for him last spring, did not allow access to fund health care managed working teams, by which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Leaders of the town, this accusation categorically rejected.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a meeting of the Municipal Council, held last month, said Education Minister Dennis m. Walcott, that the release was part of the budget approved in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the members of the Council immediately countered that the budget is nowhere specifically was the release of ancillary staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Representatives of District Council 37 announced that has already filled in the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of education, that it will be sued. On Wednesday called a press conference, where he formally brought before the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The two defendants were in the process will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of education, while the claimant will be eight displaced workers, of which all are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had seen action, and therefore the individual accusations will express.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to the proposal the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, unions focused on quantities released in the poor parts of town, thus wanted to support his claim of unfair negotiations. Holding the view that the poor schools have more assistants, because they are already long denied adequate financial resources.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">They point out that while in the schools in Staten Iceland, nepropouštělo, and in parts of the Upper East Side, Brooklyn, in the part of District 23 in the Brownsville came on the work of 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was placed even 46 assistants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Recalls that in school Public School 36 in Harlem lost work of five of the eight assistants, although this is a school, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. In the application, says: "it's not about the neighbourhood full of wealthy parents who can procure funds to offset the deficit in the budget."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The budget of the schools Public School 36 this year was reduced by 3,26% and the school also lost money when the city changed the method of calculating the bonus funds for each logged-on a poor student.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In addition, the unions argue that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which it was written in the document authorizing the release of the parent coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the document, it was used to describe the action, the word "excess", i.e., cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the movement of teachers from the payroll of the school into a database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," says the draft complaint, "and not only moved into the database on the position of workers."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="7">The said sentence might appear innocently, but no debate concerning Libya, when the have not been easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">During the summer, lawmakers from both parties constantly quarrelled among themselves and with the White House on the text of a statement series for approval or rejection of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">This week, will decide whether to start the process of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the case of rape.</seg>
<seg id="3">If not, they are prepared to take action to the hundreds of other plaintiffs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Private first class Elizabeth Lymanové was at night, when she was allegedly raped by his colleague from the army for 25 years and was at 11. week of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="5">It happened in October 2008 and she was pointing to the barracks at the Miramar air base North of San Diego. After dinner with a friend on his male colleague bearing box of 12 beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked her if it can connect that with her in the room might hang.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In my head I light came on warning light," described by Lymanová.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the native Texan its objections ignored completely.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: no, he's 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is from Texas," she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."</seg>
<seg id="12">Claims that only a few minutes after they went to her room, the man walked over, threw her on the bed and raped her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, 18. November 27, Lymanová and other existing or former members of the army, to wait for the verdict hearing which could have a historical impact. It will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it goes on, whether the charges against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald may fail, he gets up before the Court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The indictment States that Gates and Rumsfeld have fallen short in the fight against the spread of rape in the military, which is in contradiction with the constitutional rights of soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The indictment was filed in February of a Washington lawyer, Susan Burkeovou, and the claimant was at that time the 17 members. During the following months, however, their number has grown to 28-25 women and three men who all claim they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army after the notification of these útků failure in the investigation, punishment and any pursuit for justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke contends that the neck the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The army's direktivním system," he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the pursuit of the imposition of measures against such action? The high command. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also asserts that since February has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could be included in other lawsuits filed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">Its strategy: rather than gathering all the charges in this case-packed all eggs in one basket, as she says-an application in several different cases, if needed, to pressure nepolevil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A team of Defense Ministry of defence leads State representative of the United States Neil MacBride, which together with its collaborators initiative to reject the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Judicial documents, which won the Newsweek, are discussing a strategy of defence in detail-in principle, that current or former soldiers, the army cannot sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the regulation of the Supreme Court from 1950 called as the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injuries will suffer from the soldiers in active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged injuries relating to military service, the complainant," it says in the document.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">Although women still officially not serve in combat, it's just semantics: in modern wars can be hard to find a course that is the line.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams of female soldiers increasingly more pronounced role, particularly in the area of communication with civilian women occuring in a war zone.</seg>
<seg id="29">Result: between the wars was 150 soldiers of the female sex-two-thirds of them directly in combat.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now is the time to have been modernised and in the army, "explains Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In my fight is not alone. In addition to her case dealing with three other legal representatives.</seg>
<seg id="32">The law school Yale prepare visitors veteránského seminars on the legal service of the action on the four main military Academy for developing atmosphere promoting hatred for women.</seg>
<seg id="33">Irrespective of the non-profit organization American Vietnamese veterans gather supporting documents for their action aimed against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorders", which was supposedly established for victims of rape to the army a pretext to their release, according to activists, such as Ana Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women's Action Network, this is a perfectly normal practice.</seg>
<seg id="34">Her group already in December filed a proposal for action against a State Organisation for negotiations with the veterans, which he accuses of discriminatory practices, which should occur in the processing of requests for help from the people who claimed to have been in the service of sexually infected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In Congress, presented nine separate proposals, which has made the Group of Senators and members of Parliament from both political parties, and proposed a number of remedies in those measures.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the Office for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence, the Ministry of defense was in 2010 reported 3 158 sexual attacks.</seg>
<seg id="37">This type of attacks remains, however, in most cases, wanders in the Pentagon's own estimates, this number is approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents occurring in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a report issued in March is dismantled and the rate of criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, the Court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army-which is half compared to the civilian judicial system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Prosecutors in the case of the Deputy Burkeové describe the attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Private first class Lymanová, for example, reported the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was to follow.</seg>
<seg id="41">During the night, he says, was asked to give details about his rape repeated eleven times to various members of the police, physicians, and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">Underwent all the tests necessary to determine rape and her bed was found the attacker's blood-from the, which he has done on his arm.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, graduated from Lymanová hearing before a judge, during which it considered issues relating to that on the day of the attack she loved with her boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="44">It ordered six persons as witnesses on the reputation of the spoke in favour of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day when a sentence," says Lymanová.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had the feeling that right there on the spot, shouting," Ellie-I ran out of the courtroom. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"Put me to a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I was his commanding officer said: it wasn't his court. Was mine. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lymanové--visit a military psychiatrist, which it eventually diagnosed personality disorder, making her as unfit for duty.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010 she was from the army without honor and therefore not eligible for výsluhu released.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whatever the case, the applicants ' Lymanové and other moves to the next phase or not, it's run on the long track, says John Turley, Professor of law at the Law University of George Washington.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, he notes, "from my point of view, should be able to refer to other phases of consultation."</seg>
<seg id="52">Between them and indeed, however, is the doctrine that has been criticized since the first time she saw the light of the world.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The military is decades behind, because their duties do not indicate to the same level of motivational incentives and deterrent devices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: "the odds are heavily against them. .. but it is important for them to try."</seg>
<seg id="56">To change occurs only when the good people are willing to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, Burkevoá, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, collected hundreds of other people ready to take action and begins work on other causes relating to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We are with the army to fight on this issue, where there is no reform," he says.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Walls have eyes: how scientists are exploring on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man his anti-immigrant views presented on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, the Braivik, who confessed to killing červencovému rage, after which left in Norway 77 dead, attended her first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although Breivik to act alone, not lonely in cyberspace, certainly: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing groups on social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tragedy of this summer, the scientists want to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how to find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy-just go to Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We realized that to get it, it's not really that difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of the recently released report of the British research team, which concerned the European digital populism.</seg>
<seg id="9">Supply of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett that the scientists enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the pages and with absolute precision to determine the demographic you are looking for a group, something they do public relations workers for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans, right-wing groups, whereupon they focused attention and sent them the ads. However, instead of through their enchantments to the newly created group or offer them some dietetic products, urged them to fill in a questionnaire in which were questions relating to the level of their education, the relationship to violence and optimism due to their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans 14 various right-wing groups in 11 European countries-without ever having to leave the Office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's a whole new way of conducting research," observes Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, which let him get to the growing rate of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But on the other hand, "those who its on-line activism combined with off-line activism are more sensible, more democratic and less násilničtí than those who remain constantly hiding behind the screen of a computer."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The work team of the DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new instrument in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research teams, health professionals, scientists and political scientists use these pages to study everything from health issues to social trends hiding status updates, news on the walls and pressed the buttons "I like it".</seg>
<seg id="17">Facebook says more than 800 million active users. Each day, on average, provide three different data, which from this social network is literally "the information Supernova", which stands for the development of many new research. The number of academic theses, in whose name contains the word Facebook, increased as compared to the situation five years ago, to nearly 800%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some of the scientists is the magic of Facebook, it gives them the possibility to study the people, without having to bother somewhere on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Previously, if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You would have to get to the party, but you would never allow this" says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"All this Facebook hooked up-just go directly to them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others argue that the page can offer a way to identify the socio-medical problem and avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a recent study, Dr. Megan Morenové of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that college students who discussed their drunken outputs on Facebook, they were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="24">Morenová proposes that the peers page monitoring and students came in with an offer to help the student who publish too many drunken forms.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The problem can be solved if you can't diagnose him," said the Washington Post, Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morenové and the Director of the Center for health, behavior, and development of children in the children's Research Institute in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We found a way to identify at-risk children that we did not have a chance to appear."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook alone constantly sonduje the data of its users.</seg>
<seg id="28">The information team pages prepared by the statistics relating to the context and the forms of relationship, of St. Valentine's day, voter turnout in 2010, and the coefficient of satisfaction of the people (mainly with the use of the information to which they had access-Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the page should have their information available for research, and the treasure of the other).</seg>
<seg id="29">But Facebook users know that the page is monitored, whether they like it or not-in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, it should be a page to provide your personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if Facebook users to become part of the research, which they don't even know?</seg>
<seg id="31">Scientists have clearly-defined rules on how to collect data off-line. On-line data, however, are accessible to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I think most users would even scientists can look into their profile," says Neil Selwyn, London Knowledge Lab, the sociologist, a study in 2006, which was carried out with the use of public facebookových the walls of their students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"When it came to them, so that the information is only between them and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then also consider the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even when off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">Facebook is not possible to check, how much of the information on the profile and contributions on the wall.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What do you say on Facebook, and what do you do outside of Facebook, they are two quite distinct things," says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why you Selwin, who spent long years, research new technologies, he thinks that the pencil and the notebook remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.</seg>
<seg id="39">"When you go into the real world and you're talking to real people, it's something that can't be replaced, '' he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Social research should be about the company and social activities-and the hell a lot of social activity still takes place off-line."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobsem on in the movie to theaters this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">As soon as Steve Jobs 5. October died, began to discover the views of people who compared with Henry Ford-and chose him for his genius, the greatest modern inventor.</seg>
<seg id="3">The recently re-invented Jobsově conversation, which was oprášen for a special film, who's heading to theaters this week, it will be for all the Apple fans, the fact that his creative mind perfectly understand business processes and work flows for standing behind its products.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was an idealistic and hip, a member of the self-proclaimed hippie, but also pedantským the organizer and the man who every detail coordinates to the smallest detail-he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that it is actually a great idea from 90 percent of their work. [but] a great idea and excellent end product is still a long way to bite work. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995 he worked for Bob Cringely on the TV show, the triumph of the sighting, which dealt with the dawn of the personal computer. During the filming took place, more than an hour of conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the time, had already been ten years since he was forced to leave Jobs Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and impatiently looking how the general public will take the internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the TV show was eventually used a short part of the whole Cringelyho interview and on the original copies of the interview was rumored that lost in the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after Jobsově death, however, the VHS copy found in the režisérově garage.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is this material, slightly sestříhaný, forms the basis of 68minutového slide, Steve Jobs: the lost interview, which is heading into selected theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who was famous for his reluctance to provide more Jobs for the talks here is surprisingly enthusiastic, that thus on its technological philosophy and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also shows a very thoughtful man.</seg>
<seg id="12">Four times during the interview, between question and answer there is a longer pause-10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how the Jobs the answer perfectly considers that what that describes you and accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when the surface of the leaves when perfectionism Jobsův Cringelyho matters is impatient, and popohání him to quickly get to important issues and topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The interview was filmed before the era of Pixaru, iPod or iPhonu and appear in it frighteningly prophetic ideas, Jobs, evaluate what others are doing society good and bad, and offers his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">One thing is actually reading a posthumous assessment Jobsovy career, but on the Jobs, which we see here as rewarding the dreamer in the flowering of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">Has his own vision of how a case can and should look like.</seg>
<seg id="17">It didn't take long, and after his thoughts, he also put into practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of the seven scenes from the lost interview ", which certainly is worth noting:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">How to learn to drive enterprise:</seg>
<seg id="20">"During the years of business, I always asked: why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: No, it just does. "</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, never on matters relating to the business, not in depth.</seg>
<seg id="22">I found out.</seg>
<seg id="23">Liposuction continues that describes its efforts to simplify the accounts in the company Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was totally confused of how they have been recorded costs-often begin with the word "standard cost", the amount thereof could only imagine. At that moment he decided to go their own way-has developed an automatic tool which guarantee that they could trade costs determine during the fly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">How did prank to the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs remembers the "Blue box", which was built by Steve Wozniakem-a device that people give effectively hack into the phone company and free call anywhere in the world.</seg>

<seg id="30">"We were young and we have found that they can build a thing, which is able to manage the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">Alone we made a tiny little thing that could control a much larger giant-it was an incredible experience and I never emerged without her Apple.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs continues the description of a joke, which with Wozniakem almost dragged to the end. Through the Blue box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked about whether it would be able to speak with the Pope, with the best flying Henry Kissinger.</seg>

<seg id="36">Not long after their 20minutovém the conversation already had Jobs provided in the summer a brigade of Hewlett-Packard Company.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Incredibly influenced me. It was the only company that I knew at the time, and shaped my views on it, what kind of company is and how to treat their employees. "</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the corporate research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".</seg>
<seg id="39">He was as big as a trunk, CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a teenager I'm HP went higher and higher, fooling around, and he began writing programs for it.</seg>

<seg id="41">What's making the upgrade:</seg>
<seg id="42">Several Jobs during the interview, he speaks about how to invent new products at runtime.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the early days of his career, when he went to sell a couple of plates with printed circuit boards, one customer asked to forge together a whole computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Available only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, assembled and delivered the finished device.</seg>
<seg id="45">If it was later in the company of Apple, recalls the problems faced in the development of the computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember how we were quite a wild fight. .. they shouted at me, it would take five years [build a mouse, which would cost US $ 300] when I got tired, I went outside and found a designer."</seg>
<seg id="47">About 90 days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $ 15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">How big companies there is breath:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs carefully predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision of the zakolísá and lose market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Let's say that you work for the companies IBM, or Xerox, so you better copier or printer, and what's next?"</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you have a monopoly on the market, so the company company cannot be successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">At the moment it is sales and marketing, so companies šéfují the people who have to worry about this, as people have to worry about their own products are vyšachováni from the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="53">Technological genius who led the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about the good or bad products-skill and technical knowledge are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">That's exactly what happened in the Xerox ...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox could have literally the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">Could be 10 times bigger than it is, could be Releases of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, instead of the victory zadělali on failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Taking innovation as a form of art:</seg>
<seg id="59">"Between a great idea and excellent end product is still a long way and a lot of work ... and what a great idea evolves, so changing and growing."</seg>
<seg id="60">During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.</seg>
<seg id="61">You must agree to the entire series of compromises-certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do to do either.</seg>
<seg id="62">You must have in mind constantly 5 000 things-the different concepts-and put them together.</seg>
<seg id="63">Finally, depends on the taste-you're trying to think of the best thing that humanity has called into being, and in a certain way, is trying to reflect on what they are doing.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists are copied, but the best artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">I have never been ashamed of it, that I'm the best ideas to burgle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas were having dinner with the opponents of the law on health care, at a time when their case in court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection against the law on health care, President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the gala dinner sponsored by the legal firm, which will be before the Court participate in the negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases to be discussed was action by 26 States of discrediting the radical revision of health care, which last year approved by the Congress-a law which mobilized conservative activists around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed that the proceedings be heard. In March, however, expects a 5-hour negotiations whose outcome still more unsettling the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and at the time of issue of the decision will be in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A lawyer, who stands before the Court of Justice and will seek to achieve the rejection of the law, will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George w. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clementova law firm PLLC, Bancroft, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner, the Federalist Society, a group that has long been engaged in the defense of conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another company which has sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the law, the so-called zpochybňujících. The National Federation of independent business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor of the was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which they are in the process of huge financial resources are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner took place in the Washington Hotel several hours after the debate on the topic of the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">He participated, among other, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and endorsed by the opponents of the law on health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">And the placing of guests? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It's not new: this pair of judges with the actions of the Group participating in the Federalist Society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And certainly it's not about anything, it would be contrary to the rules of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, these justices relieved of the obligation to respect principles of behaviour, which are subject to a lower federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If it does not, however, would be their behaviour include: under the principle of the C4, which says that "a judge may participate in the actions, which are related, and other organizations in order to obtain funds, however, the judge must not be speaker, guest of honour, nor must it be placed on the programme of action."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two legal firms cast in the case, and also a company with a huge financial interest in this case, richly enough alerted the activists calling for ethics in Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code behavior is contrary to the claims of several judges of the Supreme Court, acting under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the organisation of the Common Cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges were drinking and having dinner on the societal benefit, together with legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss your case before the Court."</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the legs of all claims to the cast, which is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas to his critics have demonstrated little understanding and told them that they also seamlessly combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups, such as the Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thomas wife Ginni is a highly built a conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical issue has mainly judge Elena Kaganová and not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kaganová worked as the General Prosecutor for the Government of President Obama, when he first appeared before the Court arguments against the law.</seg>
<seg id="25">Critics of the Kaganové of her pushing to renounce participation in the case, and argues that if so many fought for the law to now be disinterested.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kaganová not given any indication that she was about to resign.</seg>

<seg id="1">The warning from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the field of defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress get put under the boiler, when warned that the looming automatic budget cuts may undermine national security and cause financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civil assembling lines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon will have to so spend the budget reduction of $ 450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears a reduction of a further US $ 600 billion, if Congress fails to conclude an agreement relating to the expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of such cuts would be devastating for the whole resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham 's, South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the inability of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment causes 23% flat-rate decrease and stop many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Because of the way the huge reduction in use by this ill-judged way, it is not possible to carry out most of our building or ship's projects-you can't buy only three quarters of the buildings or ships. In addition, would result in serious damage to the other modernisation efforts, "Panetta wrote senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We are Also forced to separate many of our civil servants, and, since the reduction take place so rapidly, we also have to almost certainly civilians sent to compulsory leave, to be able to fulfill the requirements of the target."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes can shatter the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously impair its readiness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Finally, the cuts to affect the combat units, said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations overseas, these obstávka directly affect the operation, will be adversely affected by substantial changes in the other budgets," said Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The cuts even in the contractual personnel, which will result in the delay of negotiated contracts that support the war efforts of our people."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Reduced the statuses of paid employees, of which will flow and delayed payments to vendors and the subsequent disruption of legal and political aid."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two Senators wrote off the Panettovi ten days ago and asked him about the details regarding the possible impacts on the automatic spending cuts in the Ministry of defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequences of the obstávky at the Ministry of Defense could cause rapid degradation of the United States as a world military power."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are strictly against this tough measures," senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when make Panettův letter.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is not the conclusion that we could live, and it is certainly below we do not sign."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not let that happen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"Remains to be seen whether the Panettův letter and a fresh warning to increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and will reinforce the voices calling for the Pentagon's omission from the list of cuts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta was recently in talks on possible cuts to the increasingly more open, although he switched to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets of Congress and the White House, so he knew that the real fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference organised by the minutý week Defense Minister suggested a brief image of what the resort waiting-the shell of the military, inside which, however, will miss the core.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will be like a ship without Marines."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It will be like a Brigade without ammunition."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It will be like the air force without trained pilots."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It will be like a paper tiger, such as army barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the speech at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It will be as a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."</seg>
<seg id="26">"As a result, it will be welcomed aggression."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the annex supplied with the letter Mccain and Graham's Panetta specifies how the reduction will have resulted in "significant operational risks: late response to the crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on the drops is this and deployment throughout the world; implied an unacceptable risk in future combat operations. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Panetta also said that some of the biggest defense projects could wait for termination, including those, which are already being tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the list, for example, the project, the planned new aircraft F35 bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, new coastal combat ship and new ground combat vehicle, which wanted the army and Marine Corps to replace the humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Stopping the further development and testing of the aeroplane F35 would save over the next ten years to $ 80 billion, but its proponents argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the military, which is important for the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="16">Another study showed that foreign people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in my life lied three times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Determining the lies, or "detection of lie" is the necessary skills that you should acquire each, whether from personal or work reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to, say, a Charade, when a man screams: "I got you". Detection of deception is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected during the last six decades in prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and philosophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of research is that most of the old myths about the lies has been refuted.</seg>
<seg id="20">Liar you can look in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's not that zadrhávali, koktali, blush or ošívali.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">However, the nevyvozujte of it, that it is somehow difficult to detect liars espy and.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trained the lies he can reveal the truth of the sentence structure, small expressions on his face, the way of creating questions and their timing.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years collecting scientific knowledge of the extensive and developing sectors related to the detection of lies and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skills, which can be easy to learn, and in today's complex world, you can help-especially if your responsibilities include hiring, arranging interviews, negotiation or leadership.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liar can read in the other, they are still wary, direct their emotions and intuitively realize, as the other party accepts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">From research we know that extroverti is a lie more often than introverti men making more "adopted by" lies, while the women say more lies "aimed at the other"-mostly because to protect someone's feelings-that married people lie less often their partners than single people (but the lies that they are usually "outrageous").</seg>
<seg id="27">Also, we know that if you are perceived as a sinner, the others feel less guilty when you're lying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How do I know that someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, watch the normal behavior of the body.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is called "initial observations."</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to him, will have a subsequent findings with what to compare.</seg>
<seg id="32">Note the posture the body, its funny, work with your voice.</seg>
<seg id="33">You should know, if someone normally taps his feet constantly, you wrongly accused of lying only because the middle of the meeting starts tapping his feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and neverbálního behavior.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider it, however, only as warning signals, not as evidence of the lies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People speaking a lie may stop to move the upper half of the body, as he tries to remember his made-up story, the toes bend over to get to the door, to the East, significantly change the posture or make known "relief after the end of the interview"-an a great relief it and change the position, when is a difficult confession for them.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people conducting the interviews are often issue a false signal that the interview is over, just to see how it will look like a relief after completion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also feel the body language.</seg>
<seg id="39">Famous is a story about how Scott Peterson once slipped and used the last time when he argued that the murdered woman is alive, which began a nationwide search for her body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Klamající individuals may also express coldly: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady ... Miss Lewinsky" or difficult question of all be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal characters are only very slight.</seg>
<seg id="42">Anyone can use a lot of "zmírňujícího language" when answering a difficult question: "well ... to be honest ... from what I know ... According to the best of my knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="43">In fact, such a reply too know and often regards the other warning signal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic, which would reveal any lie, but it is possible to learn the skills, by means of which we can lie down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Using these skills will have one more chance, that in his personal work and buys a liar and to the phisher.</seg>

<seg id="9">"The framework is now well marked," he added.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of creating a Government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, for which the amount of the debt has soared to unsustainable levels.</seg>

<seg id="17">It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Makes you more pressure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the greatest show, which we showed in the last 21 years, arose within a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have some great show in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get to the forms of the concert at Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we are looking forward to the concert too.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, like serfujeme, we like the jungle. For the two activities is Costa Rica the best countries in the world.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends go surfing at Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best places for surfing. And so we learn about Costa Rica, through the people who love surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">If you look on your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many of the songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What you have planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Whereas, we never played, we have no restrictions on what they could do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We'll try to show you what the best show with a variety of songs. We'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and imagine our fans a good and varied repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never neopakujete repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think that is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes a different structure, therefore it is difficult to choose which songs we play every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three in the Repertoire of songs that we have long advertisers, we focus on them and we also surprise, because considering why we love and that we may have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">So for us, the show more interesting, and therefore I think that it is more interesting to people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Following the tour celebrate 20 years of artistic career.</seg>
<seg id="37">If you look back, it is hard to believe everything you did?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, that's for sure.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we'll be in one large rock group and that we stay in it for more than 20 years. It sounds like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We realize how much we have been given and moves us, that we can continue to play together.</seg>
<seg id="41">We love each other and love making music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We're lucky that we can look at the place, which we've always wanted.</seg>
<seg id="43">We could not have gone better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What you meant that you were an important part of the formation of the genre grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">For us, that we can be part of this group, in which they are represented in all of the greats.</seg>
<seg id="46">People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice in Chains are our friends.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when the movement is from the Group of friends, very often, it never happens.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time arises in the city group, but is much less common to one city at a time was obtained from five to ten groups.</seg>
<seg id="49">We're proud of it and we are proud that we can be part of a group from Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes we play with some more.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were at the Festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We're lucky that's all our friends and we are proud that we can be part of this movement, which was founded in Seattle, Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Also, it is very unusual that a group like yours to keep together, and even after all these years still the same members.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, the four of us we already 21 years and Matt (Cameron) is to join us 13 years ago, which, in itself, is much longer than the usual duration of the group.</seg>
<seg id="54">I think that first of all we're all lucky that we're still in this world and, secondly, its role is the fact that we kept each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are close friends and we have managed to open the musical paths, which are each sufficient freedom to his own experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think it could be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship to the word glory was not simple. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.</seg>
<seg id="58">How do you balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we grow, gradually getting easier to find the right balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We're trying to tour at all too, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.</seg>
<seg id="61">When you realize that the people came for the music, you must remind them that the music and what you gave her, respect. You may not get carried away by the celebrities, rock stars. This is not one of us ever really cared about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How do you remember the next project of the Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think that we were writing great songs and at the beginning it was something spectacular.</seg>
<seg id="64">As a band we have existed for three years and we never had released any album, after he died, Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important is that, even today, been friends for with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out in the band with us. When you listen to a song, or a look at the photos, I remember Andy as he was incredible, as I having with him. It's always a pleasure to work with him, laughing, talking about music or about football and many others.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an incredible person and is missing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">National band Las Robertas will be responsible for that in Costa Rica started the show.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that you know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that therefore you have selected them as the bands?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production of the video sent to us with several proposals, and this group, we enjoyed the most. Therefore, we're wondering what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very funny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why always live changing words Yellow Ledbetter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That's the question on Eda (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Who you as a bass singer affects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">A lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="75">As the first I can think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, c. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski.</seg>
<seg id="76">There's so many that I could talk all night about the basistech who I like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How did Pearl Jam hold the grunge, although no longer in vogue?</seg>

<seg id="1">The Park or the mountains?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects met on the occasion of opening a procedure, which entails more than the controversy regarding the fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Urban tender for 16 Gates once again opened the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid-1980s. years at the time of the greatest flowering of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this authority to print several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.</seg>
<seg id="5">Leaflet has defined mountain as a large park Metropolitan Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">What's more, he was accompanied by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, in 1987, the lapse, CMB, park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are not set on the axis North-South, but up (mountain)-down (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">Collseroly qualification as a natural park, it is in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reference has already been Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of Yogi bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such was the position until September, when the Town Hall announced the mega competition, consisting of 16 competitions for the same number of gateways to the Collseroly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gateway, of course, begs the more the idea of the Park.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either this, or someone trying to put a gate on the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only question is, therefore: Collserola, park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational, as well as on the basis of reflection on the town, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona's architects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's already a topic as clich? d, such as when two members of this old caste of the chosen meeting in an elevator shall hand.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this action is one of the rare matches between what he thinks three předstoupivší barcelonští architects and university professors.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: selection procedure has its merit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to Roldána, after had originally question side of the Bay, "it should be" discuss on the "mountain side", so speech Ildefonse Cerda Green apples not got dragged to the end.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have to be based on the principle that most Barcelona Park is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Inter alia, his great availability.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, "said the architect, for which the name" gateway to Collserola "carries" lexikologickou trap ": we have is to represent" as inputs to the Park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to act ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experience from the world urbanism qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" allowing "some risk".</seg>
<seg id="23">The danger of "uncertainty, which is a project of a public place" after the experience of the 1980s. years, which was in the area of Forum "my swan song."</seg>
<seg id="24">The first concern is the very definition of borders, which should be built upon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Do Something to define the means already the next step", that is, in principle, to move a step further.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It should be borne in mind, the new urban and planning tools, because the current (with reference to the General metropolitan plan (PGM)) may cause a a real disaster".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">If we look in more detail the question of Modol believes that the Valley slope Collserola can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona of not, and for reasons that are purely topographical.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol also reminded that there is already work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which "may not end up on the rubbish," Although welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its context, that the project reaches from the "first time".</seg>
<seg id="29">And, moreover, means that the proximity of the mountains and the town is a kind of pass, which allows architects to participate in the debate, but "doubts" that it should be this technical profile, which will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill", he says) that need to be created: "Architects should be only the Tools".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game, is a complex, because the supporting documents for the tendering procedure is missing a global vision of the Collserola: "was published 16 competitions, which deal with all of the axis of the mountains-the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies, which would be the area watched and recognized it as a whole".</seg>
<seg id="31">This has meant that at least he volunteered to all 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the project of one gate can be hindered on the concept and definition of architect neighboring gateways.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, the City Hall to ensure that the zone immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should ensure in the entire length of the zone facilities, to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexican Institute of health insurance has started research on a gene that causes obesity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Institute of health insurance leads research in order to discover the gene responsible for the obesity children and teenagers. Research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute IPN</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexican Health Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that leads research in order to detect the gene for obesity in children and young people. Research entitled "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" allows to obtain the results relating to overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the report, the head of Research of the medical unit in the field of biochemistry of the National Medical Center Hospital specialized in 21. century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that was established a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, experts in nutrition, and social workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team relies on the support of specialists and pupils, post-graduate studies from the National Institute of public health (INSP) and the Centre for research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the national polytechnického Institute (IPN).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Engage in research may also the general public, having or not having the permissions. People may come into participating in the sports centres of the IMSS in the Valle de México, where they each Saturday from 8 hours to carry out tests of adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He emphasized that the research he began in the sports centre of the Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and 8. October, this activity is carried out also in the Sports Centre Nezahualcóyolt (East of the Mexican State).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once they obtained the data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Centre Independencia (South of the Federal District), and finally in the sports centre of Morelos (North of the Federal Centre).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the elements and importance of genetics, regards the development of obesity, and track down the Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the occasion of the international day of the diabetes, which is celebrated on 14. November, he reminded that the aim is to collect the data from the three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires about nutrition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The questionnaire will ask also for physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases with the aim of avoiding risk factors which might cause diseases such as diabetes or renal inadequacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Clarified that every Saturday with all participants carry out antropometrická measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), measure the blood pressure, determines the level of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and to examine the genes (trying to identify genes that are involved in the formation of childhood obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz López stated that this study reflects concern over the growth of Medic alarmujícím children's weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">' Health Survey undertaken between 1999 and 2006 have shown that in just six years only for boys, to an increase in obesity by 77% and for girls of 47%. The dramatic increase took place also in the case of overweight ', said the expert of the IMSS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Stated that one of the reasons the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from other populations of their genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Reported that the average Mexican's 65% of the indiánsko-American genetic predispositions, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for diabetes and overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained that in General, genetics of obesity is commonly explained as inability to burn excess energy, which konzumujeme (calories), and which is stored in the form of fats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The scientist explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive in the overall assessment of the situation of children, which finds that show any known of overweight or obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">He said that even the presence of wrinkles dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability that the individual will suffer through problems and předcukrovkovými States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The information is confidential, it shall be transmitted in writing to the parents, doctors and explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must be carried out so that their children can avoid illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the sedentary way of life, indicating the lack of daily physical activity, all day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Overweight causes also a large intake of food, that is, the greater the consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (bread, tamales, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic burden which is the subject of this research.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the Asphalt from the UNAM are bumps</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the chemical Faculty of the UNAM creates Renault with polymers and creating a combination of having a better functionality, regardless of the weather conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If properly handled on the Cobbles, it would not be correct to almost 200 thousand potholes after each rainy season in the metropolitan area, the Valle de México, said Rafael Nájera Herrera, a scientist from the chemical faculty (FQ) of the UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even could be completely removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his lecture, the Technological cause potholes said in the framework of the international year of Chemistry Laboratory, announced that under his leadership, develops Renault with polymers, which should emerge from a mixture of having similar characteristics as the asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera is of the opinion that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some cities in the North of the country. Improve the functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Explained that the asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with large molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and the other with a low molecular weight, which are known as malteny. Together supplying asphalt typical viskoelastický character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Viskoelastický the character of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, behaves like a fluid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost solid, while at low temperature asphalt has tendency to worry, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but it varies during the day, according to the weather conditions and temperatures, said an expert on chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A scientist from the chemical Faculty of the observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México it is covered with a flexible tile, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the layers of the nejsvrchnějšími is the tar file, consisting of small stones drenched in asphalt and then compressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He emphasized that every stone, which forms the Insert, it is through the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">Passing cars or when creating the pressure it is possible to force the pavement right up.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it was modified asphalt, decompose would be even better, believes a chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">He added that on the asphalt pad is placed on the last layer called the cloak, consisting of fine sand, stones, also filled in the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whereas, this layer will be coming into contact with the rims of vehicles, must have greater mechanical strength than the tar file and must ensure that the friction of the road.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Whereas, as part of the pavement will be exposed to large loads, must have a cloak of sufficient thickness, and care must be taken to the material from which it is made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Climate, in particular the humidity and temperature changes, they are also a very important factor that you should keep in mind. In particular, the water has a large influence on the functionality of the asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As soon as the ground is wet, water travels inside and it is hard to get out, it causes softening of all layers of pavement and the formation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Explained that during the creation of potholes in the film as the first coat and then leads to damage to the asphalt. Damage but does not occur in a single moment, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs of using appropriate maintenance programmes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a member of the national system of scientists also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the tile must match the load of vehicles and must guarantee that this burden shall not exceed. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent emergence of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera pointed out that as regards the asphalt, still waiting for us a lot of work and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsion, which are in other countries, are already available on the market and enable you to easily fix the bumps without the use of high temperature.</seg>

<seg id="1">What was missing from the top of Valle, to become the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of factors that have contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna has not received the Crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle so gaining 14. the title of the first vícemiss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Valle del Cauca has once again regained the Crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with that ended up on the podium of Wimbledon, won the silver Crown and sash, on the basis of which become the new first vícemiss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On the basis of the results of the previous finals in Cartagena, which won and the sceptre took Miss Atlántico, the Department gained 14. the title of the first vícemiss. Melina has joined the masses of women from Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of victory Crest, but eventually was declared the first vícemiss. They include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuelo Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The question many are asking. What is missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">The result is the defeat of the great Sultana, which in all previous rounds has shown that he is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain, became Queen of the police and the prettiest face Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">One of the key factors that decided that the jury has decided to appoint her, only the first vícemiss, is the fact that I didn't answer his question: "which book you liked the most, and why?", which put the Martín Murillo Gómez from literary editors Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To the question, she replied:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot. Very I believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of zkulturňování. The book, which influenced me most in childhood, "the little Prince", a very deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently I'm reading "crime and punishment". It's a book that is part of the worldwide literature, which we should all know. And today I've got a book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. This is a beautiful book with the name "El ardor de la sangre".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This response, like the term "culturize," and, secondly, because she did not explain her individual mentioned the book marked.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the awards ceremony Melina declared that it is easy, and my joy from the result: "the world is wise, what has to happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And you people read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bogotský journalist, suggested that that candidate was from the beginning of his favorite, and the one who took all the previous price (Gastronomic challenge or Ostyor, title to the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other uchazeček, vystresovalo Queen, who then failed once on stage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It was evident at the first presentation of the swimsuit on the beach Hilton, and during the two weeks before the final coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although both shone, it was evident that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm, which demonstrated a reprezentantky from the Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, journalist of "at home" on Canal RCN believes that that Melinda has won the title of the first vícemiss is confirmed by the fact that the candidate who wins the most during the competition titles eventually leaves with the Crown of the Queen ".</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle in recent days suggested more hostile position to the media, and he did not serve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to persuade the jury about his interest in social work, which are the basis for the national competition of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just on the edge, two days before the election of the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that looking for a woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"In the competition of Miss Colombia beauty in itself is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on the social feelings. It is important that female candidates before entering the competition, have been involved in such projects, "she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It also speculates that she lost points due to shortcomings of the Valle of his background and fibrosis, which was on the tail. But this is completely contrary to the jury that it indeed has chosen miss natural beauty "for the healthiest body proper nutrition, physical activity and responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Jorge Hernán Orozco, who the Queen is preparing, acknowledges that Melina was not the best body that there were better girls, "but the problems with the specialist on the tail, which in my opinion was not very apparent, she stepped down points until the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos magazine believes that-born from the Valle made a mistake, when it underwent several surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle they screwed up.</seg>
<seg id="29">The body was never her strong point and here takes its toll ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this award, which the National Assembly for the first time udělovalo beauty, after the show in a bathing suit to harsh predictions, which is filled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melině took her to finally grant the highest Crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether it's true or not, it is certain that Melina launched today a year of his reign, not as a Queen, but as a Princess, from a position which gives her the possibility to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where it will be designated as the National competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, entered into history as one of the Queens, which, despite amazing success in Cartagena to the highest crest.</seg>

<seg id="5">Of seven experts on fingerprints, who work in the Department of honour, was this week to Eliazar Gonzálezovi, men from Puerto Tejada, who was 21 years he works in the field of research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, González was working at City Hall in Chocó, where he often more than five days, pushing their way through the forest to get to the place where the dead bodies, that it was necessary to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, after he completed the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. The science dealing with the study of the friction of the skin, hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="10">Friday night into the Cauca River in the helicopter from Palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew he would have to identify two corpses, and that suspects that one of them is the man who led the oldest guerillu in the world. It therefore requested to take the card with fingerprints Guillermo León Sáenze (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the spot where the body was, it didn't recognize because of physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">The results of the second quarter-for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012-Moreover, assume the largest growth rate in comparison with the period January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines, which are necessary for the reconstruction of areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">Companies increased their investments by 1.1%, expenditure will fall by 0,9%, compared to the period January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the real waking up the Japanese economy is based exclusively on impulse, which makes use of the crisis to the left, or to the restoration of infrastructures. It's about to take advantage of the lack of it, to start completely from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan is awakened. In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.</seg>
<seg id="11">This variable is increased by 1%, thanks to the increase in expenditure on the vehicle, travel and leisure activities.</seg>

<seg id="14">With the stronger currency are products more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial soundness of large technology groups.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, Toyota or Sony situation their weak results in July and in September a course just yenu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While the markets continue to throng the peripheral countries of the EU, Government Yoshihiko Noda is prudent.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have to watch out for risks which still remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand, and the rapid increase in yenu", said yesterday State Secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.</seg>

<seg id="1">The CDU proposed to elect the European President on the basis of universal suffrage</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and his Prime Minister, the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel took place on Monday, 14. November in Leipzig for the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU).</seg>
<seg id="3">The question of the future of Europe on the program originally was not, but her in the autumn, in particular, that they were satisfied by the party members, who consider the policy of the Government to the Greeks today and maybe tomorrow against the Italians at lax.</seg>
<seg id="4">The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission brought the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only nine of the number 1001 delegates was against and 10 delegates abstentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Although standing ovation at the conclusion of performance of Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro-European Finance Minister, did not leave room for doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only that, Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">According to Chancellor in Europe, "it is time for change."</seg>
<seg id="10">This could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the Member countries of the euro area, but also it could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, "in order to give Europe a face".</seg>
<seg id="11">This is in any case one of the thoughts of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly, Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries in this revolutionary step quickly agree: against the United Kingdom, and the leaders of the CDU, thinks that the same approach shall deliver also, Nicolas Sarkozy.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the direction is vytýčen.</seg>
<seg id="14">As delegates rejected by a large majority a proposal to evaluate the weight of each country in the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Guided by the concern to calm the climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. Try to get Congress to talk about "small" European States or States which are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the proposal concerning Europe devotes one paragraph of the importance "of Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel, France never quoted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only indirectly.</seg>

<seg id="1">What constitutes fraud in incapacity?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After aid run party UMP and the Government offensive against the working neschopnostem.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15. December in Bordeaux and visit the Office for granting social aid, where it delivers a speech on the theme of recurring from 2007 on the fight against social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">As the escorts of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased stringency, but is no less clear from the perspective of right-wing of the presidential campaign, he wants to focus on right-wing majority of incapacity.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, because of budgetary savings, the Government intends to impose upon employees of the private sector on the fourth day of the incapacity before they start taking aid in sickness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Clearly, without the consent of the company, the employee who gets sick, lost four days wages, at least 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">The measures, which risks cause many bad blood, but which, according to the worksheet, Les Echos can bring 280 million euro.</seg>
<seg id="8">And also measures, which should be accompanied by other measures of a symbolic range: give civil servants a day unpaid incapacity (so far, they have no failure compared to three days in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these questions are the subject of the discussion, the right-wing majority runs also the theme of fraud aimed this time at abuses tied to labour neschopnostmi.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Checks will be much larger and in addition: If you are caught, you will be coming back," said Xavier Bertrand in the interview provided by the station RTL Sunday 13. November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth about the misdeeds of the working neschopnostech.</seg>
<seg id="12">These were in fact subject to the standing monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught which brought its fruits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are more sick than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Consider the first of several official numbers.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM-State health insurance) in 2006 paid more than 237 million euros per diem refunds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute for research and documentation in the health sector accounted for in 2008 the daily compensation allowance to their 11.3 billion euro, 5% of the expenditure in the health sector.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, with 46% of the involved parent contributions and work accidents and 54% of the covered the working inability of, i.e.. 6.2 billion euro.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore only 2.5% of the cost of health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">According to a study group Alma Consulting were the French in 2010, an average of 14,5 days of incapacity, compared with 17.8 days in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="20">Average, which carries certain derogations: another poll published in 2007 on the pages dealing with jobs Monster.com has shown that 75% of the 40,000 French employees of the respondents replied that all lessened by no day of the incapacity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time by the sickness insurance institutions, States that, in 2010 37,8% working inability was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When compared with their European neighbours, French staff are not more than elsewhere, prone to work neschopnostem.</seg>
<seg id="23">One long study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) in France has alternated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Cheating in neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the work on the black.</seg>
<seg id="25">As regards fraud, these are just small scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strengthening of legislation from 2002, there are systematic checks on the incapacity of more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, the CNAM stated that when the 1.5 million checks were 13.8% of 285,000 carried out due to short-neschopnostem "of irregular or too long", i.e.. 37 050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of systematically controlled the inability of more than 45 days, with 22, 11% of the cases, "nepřizpůsobených" or "irregular" to 1.2 million checks, i.e.. 132 000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">A total of 169 000 "irregular" cases to the several million workers who were sick.</seg>
<seg id="30">A number that represents much less than the figure expressing the work on black.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the members of the UMP, the author Dominique Tiana June report on this issue, this number would be a 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i.e.. more than the total amount of the daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than fraud associated with the last mentioned.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">It's one of the findings of the comprehensive report of the Royal Canadian society, which involves six experts working in different fields, among which was the ethics, law, and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Commission recommends that the Government amend the criminal law to legalise euthanasia is permitted and, if this option as necessary for the patient to be considered competent to take such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">At the beginning of the experts cite a recent independent survey Agency, Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada post on 10. place, the study notes that "medikalizace death in Canada gave rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medikalizace Yes or no, 77% of Canadians have access to palliative care, communicate to us the experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian society.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the wish to die at home, which has a majority of Canadians, 68.6% of them dying in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">This average shall be valid for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec is the highest with 86% of persons deceased in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With regard to the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the messages reach the conclusions that go against the position of the Federal Government, which has already said that the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">According to the experts, who also have put control of all the countries where these approaches are legalised or are not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that this causes a odkriminalizování abuse in the application, i.e.. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to the persons nepříslušné or mismatched.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, p. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday, in teleconference more than numerous cases of these mistakes in the countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not been legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Euthanasia shall be carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".</seg>
<seg id="17">"Assisted suicide is carried out also in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Noted that, according to investigations carried out by the Forum by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians already spoke in favour of euthanasia because it believes that the persons at the end of life can ease their suffering.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we send the message that life of old or hendikepovaných persons has a smaller price.</seg>
<seg id="21">As regards persons who practise legalise, 41% of the surveyed persons believe that they should not be subject to judicial prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the matter of maintenance or disruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also in the list of its recommendations propose that in the criminal law stated that the withdrawal from treatment, for which there is legally confirmed the rejection is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Commission of experts also requires that qualified doctors were educated to respect the obligation to refuse medical treatment at the end of life without the fear of prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the matter of palliative care Commission urgently requires that the Government institution in charge of health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care and even in the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, in the matter of paliativního or the final cessation of the already widely used in Canadian health care facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered at the moment already does not serve to reduce physical pain, euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.</seg>

<seg id="27">Reservations of the other experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts on medical law has already submitted its reservations concerning the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualify for the position of the experts-the signatories of the messages as "extreme", inter alia because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia on sick in the final stage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who was tired of life, and which should more than 18 years of age, could request to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who yesterday had studied the résumé reports.</seg>
<seg id="31">P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report opposed the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialist in medical law Margaret Somerville expressed "strong objections to the findings of the report which it described as" a manifesto for euthanasia ".</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, which is itself a member of the Royal Canadian society, has doubts especially on data messages relating to the absence of failures in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are been legalized, i.e.. in the Netherlands, and in the u.s.

<seg id="9">At the same time will need to face the lack of fossil resources, in order to continue to produce electricity, and not to forget the essential need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, which is the subject of, which currently goes for environmental debates.</seg>
<seg id="10">An accident in Fukušimě has no effect on any of the following parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">And that is why Germany is alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision necessary to find some other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which considered the right to build only the last generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States, after the Fukušimě decided to expand its park one unit restoring the construction of one power broken after the crash power plants Three Mile Iceland.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model based on renewable energies are sometimes presented as an example of a reality that is contrary to.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will affect the high electricity prices, increased energy dependency on gas imported from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of power plants to natural gas, and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">All these effects have already during several months.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark deserves to be above it appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The European champion in wind power plants, of which removes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularity of the wind, which are CO2 emissions and higher price of Danish electricity by 65% and 50%, than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy will pay our neighbors invoice for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in the globalized economy, energy costs represent a key factor of competitiveness and guarantee of keeping the industry on the national territory, French businesses to enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would produce a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make iluzorními a beautiful Declaration of renewed industrialization of our country and the preservation of purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The price that the great majority of French people refusing to pay, as well as are fundamentally committed to this energy, as the polls.</seg>

<seg id="25">A strong export sector for them to international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialized firms producing jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France has decided to leave the core, sacrifice would be a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises, and she'd come by 6 billion euros per year, which gets on export of nuclear equipment and services.</seg>

<seg id="29">Development of establishments producing low emissions of CO2, nuclear facilities and installations using renewable energy sources by the French Industrial Group AREVA is indicative of the complementarity of energy sources.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France we have the State Office for nuclear safety, which carries out rigorous and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power stations as well as over the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, they have the idea of safety in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="33">In fifty years, the nuclear industry recognized three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one in Three Mile Iceland happened in conditions of normal operation and remained without a human sacrifice, and the consequences for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Chernobyl reactor caused the drama concept and unjustifiable human error.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the case of Fukušimy, it seems that some people forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters unprecedented scale, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nuclear industry to take lessons from this accident, just as it did for the two previous.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is a burden for the economy of immigration or chance?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Policy in the field of immigration carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles-congestion, the police, the courts and the administration under policy number, compatibility of this policy, the status of the country of human rights ", in which France boast.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently, it was the administrative harassment to whose object were foreign students, which became the current when the Minister of the Interior (see sheet of Libération from 23 May) said that France "does not need a foreign talent, Masons and the waitress".</seg>
<seg id="4">But it has been rarely rozebírána angle of economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Must be said that in this area, the fairly wide agreement between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">The right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac, his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when, in 1990, he said that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005 he was the fear of invasion hordes of Polish plumbers on the French territory is shared to the right and to the left.</seg>
<seg id="9">In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden for the economy and the French company.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the degree of generosity, uráčíme immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme, François Hollande limited to banalities, indicates that the joint development will allow you to solve our "immigration problem".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem is maybe in the elections, economically, but is very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">How do economists like Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 str.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries which immigrants accepted.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reducing immigration paralyzes growth and bad for employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Concerns about the effects of the migrants are based on the idea that these people may replace the French workers, especially those less skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more than adding replacements for French workers, by carrying out work in sectors with the lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that don't attract the French workers, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training is not enough places menu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As well as the surgeon will have a problem with the work in the country where the lack of anesteziologů, this tween between the Frenchman and migrants make the additions of immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of the French employees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri so reckons that the growth of migratory movements of 1% will cause the long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of the přinášená immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants among us holders of the Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Migrants are also in the European countries, net contributors to social systems amounting to 1% of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">The world labour organisation e.g. It is estimated that in Germany one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring in all my life to public budgets of net contribution (revenue minus expenses) 150000 euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate, the desire to collect for a missing percent growth "with bared teeth.</seg>
<seg id="25">The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="3">Must provide gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian natural gas giant, he wanted this event to celebrate properly.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of State and Government, last Tuesday attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new pipeline, which under the sea connects directly to Russia and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together control around the valve management entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">This new pipeline begins to flow each year into Western Europe additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas the first pipe of a length of 1 224 km connecting St Petersburg region is the land of Mecklembursko-Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="8">The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity that is equal to the whole of the French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">And no longer resembles the option to build a third pipe pipeline on the same route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom has the timely completion of this huge construction character of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project is strongly protesting against Poland and the Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nord Stream will actually deliver gas directly to Germany without it, that would be conducted on the ground by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time these two countries are losing a bit of power: the ability to push Russia to threats that his close access to Western European markets, it becomes more difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most it Warsaw, when she likened to Nord Stream to "new German-Soviet Pact", referring to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">It means to say that it is a politically sensitive topic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe with its support for this project in the Russian won the greater certainty of their purchases.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is at the cost of weakening Europe energy, because the project has created a rift among Europeans from the East and the West.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia managed to barely 5 years ago to promote its vision of direct Alliance between Russia and the rich Western States with high consumption of gas, the bearings are coming to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, new Street, which connects us organically," said François Fillon at the solemn opening of the pipeline and has demonstrated the extent to which point are large natural gas contracts things as political and economic power.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, place of supply of gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical offence.</seg>
<seg id="22">Underwater pipeline is of steel bearing the mantle of concrete to be protected from anchors seagoing vessels.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m.</seg>
<seg id="24">When its construction was necessary to avoid minovým fields originating from the period of 2. during World War II.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Because of the security they have had to be nearly a hundred of them deleted or destroyed", says Jens Müller, a spokesman of the company Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">Need too build up measures for the protection of fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffelovek, which on its entire length is nowhere interrupted nor valves and stations maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">One control platform should be built in the vicinity of Sweden, but it was rejected by the project manager when the Swedes were just a few greedy to see the Russian State-owned company as permanent implants on their coast.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the case of failure to stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of a leak in the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is considered the likely little builders, it welds was designed so that a leak was created once per 100 000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Check the condition of the pipeline from the outside by an underwater robot-driven ships, while the Interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.</seg>
<seg id="33">This device is shaped with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced to the inside of the pipe and is firmly held gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">In destination throughout the three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on the potential deformations of the metal components.</seg>
<seg id="35">Long-distance gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest correction.</seg>
<seg id="36">Gas circuit is simply to ensure the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar destination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">For the realisation of this project, five companies joined forces.</seg>
<seg id="39">Leadership remains to Gazprom, which holds a market share of 51%.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is joined by the German company e.on and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream is responsible for the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">The company has its registered office in the city of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely convenient.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom then this company has leased for five years, which may be renewed, all of its capacity for the transport of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will have a profit of the entire capacity, the quantity of gas to any real," explains Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Finance the construction of ensure of the 30% of the shareholders and 70% of bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the work should reach a 7,4 billion euro for both pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="47">For group GDF Suez so investment costs have risen to 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs of returns, because the risk takes only Gazprom.</seg>

<seg id="49">Gas pipeline from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to sand with the pine forests.</seg>
<seg id="50">Valves high 4,5 metres form the output gate gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">The sensor measures the pressure, temperature, and other characteristics of the incoming gas, before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this Terminal receives every hour one million cubic meters of Russian gas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why is it so high share of unemployed hendikepovaných workers?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Around 19% of the hendikepovaných people looking for work.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today opens a 15. Week for the employment of hendikepovaných.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Via the voluntaristickou public policy established in 2005 the percentage of unemployed persons hendikepovaných twice higher than the average, i.e.. 19% compared with 9% for the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's depressing?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No, underlines the Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, which organizes the week for the employment of hendikepovaných."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"At that time, the percentage of the unemployed was not twice, but three times."</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, it remains still much to do."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It should be noted that for the unemployed handicapped persons there are numerous obstacles before their arrival to work.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is an older persons: 37% has more than 50 years ago (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have low qualifications: 80% have graduated high school and from 2,3 million students of universities is only 10 000 hendikepovaných.</seg>
<seg id="13">And finally-the long-term unemployment is very high: 53% in hendikepovaných compared to 38% on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, those are the criteria which especially complicated by the return to work and which constitute the "core problem", according to Christian Grapina, General Director of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses to receive handicapped workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As regards the objective of the brake.</seg>

<seg id="17">A study carried out in April by IMS Entreprendre pour la Cité found that respondents managers have a "low level of knowledge about hendikepovaných persons" with the "exaggerated notion of the persons on the gauze and psychological or mental deficiencies".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from that in order to achieve the objectives of the employing 6% hendikepovaných of workers laid down in the law of 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last known numbers that originate from 2008, indicate the status equal to 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Now we are around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Organization of the Agefiph, in charge of collecting fees from businesses that fail to comply with this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof is the number of "pokutovaných" of enterprises, as well as amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit on 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, especially in large enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of labour only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employs handicapped workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.</seg>
