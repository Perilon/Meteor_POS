</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse off.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even though the rate held every Saturday and Sunday, is really “ našlapaný. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">This time, with the head of the Alenkou on (the rate is not the only boy), replaced as a woman who does not have a perfectly souměrnou figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And such is the overwhelming majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone has a short neck, someone checking chlapeckou figure without proper curves and, in turn, someone overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stylista must know how optically refined broad shoulders, neck or extend to add the curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">U. S. go we so Tips, both for women like Jennifer Lopezové, so more prsa also boky and narrow passport, figure much stress and, at the same time, the woman neobléknout vyzývavě too.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, is the difference between the passport and boky that skirts or trousers actually sitting down it will then pay to tailor - make at least one such piece on peace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly you will regret it, because the perfectly - fitting clothes to nezaplacení.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In a skirt in peace you feel much better than the one that you constantly shifting, vyhrnuje, odstává in passport, and the like.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">Such information and types of characters is, of course, a lot, so I am delighted that I have a whole week for it to have all of the information in the heads of utřídila.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the same fear is that, given the zadanému domestic task is this up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the kurzistek, received přiřazenou celebritu, which has come up with two outfity: day and evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to take into account the current appearance, fashionable style of the figures, and the type of characters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I will be “ dress ” Mirandu Kerrovou, perhaps it you know from the campaigns of Victoria 's Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the spirit of jásám, for me personally, I certainly better than that Britney Spearsová, because Christina Aguilera, which recently přibrala perhaps a kilo (please, take into account nadsázku), or mladinká Selena Gomezová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Oblečky must avoid in magazines or seek online and print out and then graphically process.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moodboard, as the result of says, then express our personal style and relationship to grafickému creation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Think about graphic website stylingu is important.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stylista, neobléká not only physically, but it also creates a, for example, the so - called product pages in the journals (on specific subjects such as trends handbags, kabáty, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">Tell us about it and stylista návrhář Mario Kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it only on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Stylista must have a general overview</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturday 's lecture nabitou information about the kinds of characters zpestřili three guests from the field.</seg>
<seg id="31">John stylista Pokorný, fashionable návrhář Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and it should be able to use stylista.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a deft move stylista can work with one a piece of clothing in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">Variability in this case is the key.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So to such trenčkot (or if you originally trenchcoat) can wear a classically despite džíny and triko as cover, but it can be replaced, and on the bare body, road and lodičky nafotit as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just roll up their sleeves or límce and now the whole look is different.</seg>
<seg id="37">“ Play a cope with it, ” emphasized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the most I appreciated the following advice: “ you need to work perfectly to know the rules. ”</seg>
<seg id="39">“ Then it is you can begin to break, ” said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, it is so clear to me why drtíme all those propositions, what with the combine, what, why, when even in fashion magazines sometimes we see something else.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the parades, not to mention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to fotografovi Benovi, in turn, I know that stylista must be prepared to much more options clothes, than it is to take pictures.</seg>
<seg id="43">So in fashion story, which will have 10 parties (that is, ten outfitů), I have to be ready to “ nastajlovat ” at least 15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also that the fotce clothing looks and operates in combination with other pieces of the sometimes very differently than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With this, so we have to create a outfitu count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and style is sometimes up to half of the success, we confirmed John Pokorný.</seg>
<seg id="47">You only have to look at, which is just a miraculous zpěvačkou, but the image and marketing, have made it the world 's Star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic is not yet access to use the services of stylistů rather cold.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even the familiar faces of him sometimes seen as superfluous (just, you know, something that, as in this vypadám, is a second - tier).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if they are from us people leave a styling, then we count on us with likely imposed completely different (smaller) size, than it really is.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then we can googlovat, find out whether the tabloid, that the celebrita ztoustla / zhubla and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">John and Mario on Sunday asked us to the heart, that is not enough stylistovi focusing in vogue and able to poskládat outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the course of their work primarily communicates with the people, by putting on, and so it is important to be a good psychologem.</seg>
<seg id="54">To be able to predict people nepodbízet, the state for its opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">“ When you want a manager, to her protřídili šatník and put it on a nice pieces, so it cannot vyházet the diaries and say, for God 's sake, it' s a nightmare. ”</seg>
<seg id="56">“ Find a there at least a few things that pochválíte and will recommend what they wear, ” says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It has also, in particular, has shown that everything has to include the so - called “ placovka ”, or taška on plac.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is the one zapnete around passport and you are at all the paraphernalia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In addition to clear things, such as the gap, váleček on chlupy or zavírací pin factor, there are also silonová thread (with the stylista helped in focení products, such as handbags or hats), special klipsy, which sepneme behind the clothes, as is more (špendlík or other svorka are not permissible, destroyed would dress), or šitíčko.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">To just listen more closely to, but we also have a practical test, how we have, as you rightly podlepit shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even with focení from studio, where it is equivalent to the surface, would be podrážka could hurt, let alone outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And so we lepily and lepily.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nůžkami with shoes nor should we mention that just happens to be damaging.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is therefore need to really zručnost.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario please me, when my creation of an unqualified praise.</seg>
<seg id="66">The aforementioned zručnost, in fact, is not really my kámoška.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Need for Speed: the run with závodí across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">A review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Initially easy ride is because of a series of completely unnecessary on sloppy errors is turning into a routine morning 's path to šichtu.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ambition is largely managed to meet, but it is no use when no one is clearly did not want to do anything more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new deal with: the run has attracted before issuing a high expectations.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised that the age - old race series of Need for Speed once again takes a bit of a new direction and from hratelných of seemed like a game, which would compete in žánru action might not be just a number.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, we were wondering what comes out of flowing passages in which the hero of graduating from cars and will take place after its.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But as for a series of NFS is customary, many of them in the outcome of a little differently than we expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is potentially a decent arkádové race, but a whole runs down a few unnecessary mistakes, which is in a series of appearing more or less for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So it is that they are not even the mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible speech laziness of the developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">You can see in the story, in which the hero Jack has some problems and personal nature as a solution to a participating in illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">Behind the wheel usednete on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your job is to arrive as the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea has some interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">Route is divided into 10 stages, and then, to more than 50 plants.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that each race will go on the other line and the stage are situated in various, sufficiently different and interesting environment.</seg>
<seg id="17">One case does not have any sense that the game is still offering the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some of the environment, moreover, are a lot of fine on the surface, although the technical level grafiky corresponds to the previous series of works.</seg>
<seg id="19">So this is nothing to write home about.</seg>
<seg id="20">But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the mountains zasněžených looks visually very pleasantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The race, moreover, are from time to time zpestřeny an atypical element.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the desert, so, for example, přimotáte in sandy storm, which greatly reduces visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">By contrast, in the mountains, you have to be careful that you nezasypala flurry of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, they are well behind nasázeny individual plants.</seg>
<seg id="25">It 's not just a few types of, but it is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">The moment was so dedicated to předjet the required number of rivals (essentially a classic race), then again, you are the time (a classic duel with stopkami) and then are waiting for you to duel with the only rival.</seg>
<seg id="27">In fact, even from time to time připlete and the police, which for your efforts even further inconveniences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">New passages are outside the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rather, it is not just about such interactive animation, when Jack majority before someone prchá and you him in that you have to help, so that in the right moments tisknete right buttons.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But the surprise, that these passages in the game is much less than you would expect (specifically, perhaps even only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, but it is a good thing, because this one does not have the chance to otravným and in the context of this grows, so one of the elements that game zpestřují.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Driving the model it follows in the footsteps of previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that in today 's time, it is certainly not kdovíco, but it cannot be said that he was záporem.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you 're looking for a realistic simulation of future, you will have to look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But akčněji pojatému compete here driving model suits are still quite well, although, in a competition to find a better.</seg>
<seg id="37">Thus far, so all in all right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the problems are beginning to emerge for some time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike model schedules are already much in order is not a model of the rules of conflict.</seg>
<seg id="40">Since the game of this type, we do not expect that spočítá complex distortions and collisions, but when virtually no before the crash into any object you do not have the slightest idea, how is your car does, then perhaps it is absolutely everything in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typically in the narrow předjíždění or míjení cars in day - to - day operation of the sometimes only slightly mutually olíznete, but sometimes in almost identical situation ends up your car in wild piruetách.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even flat napadrť.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to a system of restartů that while not particularly perturbed, but rozladí you can reliably.</seg>
<seg id="44">Restarty are resolved so that if rozmlátíte or out far off course, suits you game back to last a clue to the track.</seg>
<seg id="45">But restartů is in every race available only five.</seg>
<seg id="46">When it is vyčerpáte race, you have to start again from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is rather a gadget in case something goes wrong, than that you can rely on them downright.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">But sometimes even restarty will help resolve is up to the need to learn to the section of the plant by heart.</seg>
<seg id="49">Great neduhem games is that the same things often takes place on the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some zatáčky so it is, for example, the need to drive through a specific way, otherwise they simply nevejdete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sometimes you meet on the ground “ civilian ” are always in the same configuration whether there you go first, pátí, about five seconds before or about a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">Naštve particularly in situations where you can see how between two protijedoucími cars opponent before you easily pass, whereas when you are no longer dojedete vehicles in a position that is you have to run or put the brakes on.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is one thing when they dojedete, because it is “ spočítáno ” so that the situation there was always just before your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents also have another advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">For all the time you are playing in a few places, where you are, once again, regardless of the time, always předjede the same opponent in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">Most of this praští at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you go in protisměru.</seg>
<seg id="57">An opponent has been there before you must get obviously, hopefully, at any price.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it goes before you, so you worse is an overview of the protijedoucích cars, so they initially had some pretty rozmašírujete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">We can understand the intention to do the game and exciting adrenalinovější, but implementation is so obvious that you can reliably quickly get frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="60">And this is a pity, because despite the simple driving model is playing entertaining and at times even enough action, that sometimes literally nestíháte monitor, where what lítá.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is in fact one, whether on the merit of the concept with padesátkou unikátních lines, classification plants so that nuda had a chance, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Non - traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.</seg>
<seg id="63">You have to be careful at the gasoline pump for journeys, because that is where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases, vystačíte with what it is you are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sporťáky are appropriate in urban areas, a strong american bouráky to equal highways and exotic supersporty on technical - driving, for example, after klikatých mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">With the main příběhovým regime goes hand - in - hand, mode challenges, which are racing in various locations, of which you are aware of the story.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here are given not only the medals, but also zkušenostní points to his profile, which is common to both the challenges and the story.</seg>
<seg id="68">To gain a higher level of drivers are odemykají various objects: starting with cars and finishing with pozadími for profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the same time, he is once again linked to online functions Autolog, which, among other things, comparing your achievements of other players and carries out another community functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the other, obscure kopanců is the situation of the last race in the story.</seg>
<seg id="71">With their vehicle, you go into the subway tunnel (is), where they are rushing us in the dark on the tracks (is).</seg>
<seg id="72">The tachometer you blinking for figures between 150 and 200 km / h (is) and in the rolling přiřítí analogous set the subway and uncompromising you sešrotuje.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the bureau, and perhaps even in a few days will hold a debate about whether to create the game really no one even a little nepřemýšlel, or whether we have the authors for the really big blbce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the visual impression is in most cases very congenial and, in a few cases, even the great.</seg>
<seg id="75">Zamrzí so that in some vypjatějších moments is falling imaging, and in some cases quite tragically.</seg>
<seg id="76">This concerns, but, above all, bouraček with a greater number of participants, where would you steady imagery was already done as valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Zvuková site is in order and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a bid to attract the widest possible range of rather a younger audience a soundtrack of the category of “ every dog other village ”, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music the game around just someone to buy it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of the Need for Speed: the run is so greatly puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game completely avoids unnecessary mistakes, then we would say, fearing that the run is the best bit NFS over the last couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="81">In this way, but the game is nedodělaně.</seg>
<seg id="82">Entertainment that is certainly good, but prepare for this, that you will be třískat mistakes by the force of the airport spotlight.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Czechs have the reputation of negativistů and Eurosceptics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">“ The Lisbon Treaty quite significantly undermined the balance between individual institutions. ”</seg>
<seg id="4">“ I expect that it will be a hard war. ”</seg>
<seg id="5">“ It will take five, six years before the situation stabilises calms down a bit, and before we all players used to his new role, ” began its tough a lecture at the law school, the czech ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As much as its motto “ clearly and openly about Europe ” takes seriously, has shown no longer in the first part of a lecture, when it was able to describe the EU authorities and their relationships so transparent and understandable way, that it would cause many lecturers from the law department of UK envy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“ The first was a criticism that is unremarkable, that it is a grey official, that can play a role, and I have to say that all the ton steam that is the role he managed so well. ”</seg>
<seg id="9">“ This is someone who knows how to listen to 27 Member States, brilliantly communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: “ who is that the European Union? ” to which a phone number, I call? ”, that is, as a significant step towards unification and greater legibility of EU policy against states such as China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">No one wants to ban syrečky</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Vicenová has also addressed the agenda by the European Council lived, live and will live in the near term.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech předloňské Presidency deemed a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs address emerging financial crisis, solve the crisis the gas or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the government in this time, then as a huge liability, which the Czech Republic very heavily damaged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU is currently very napilno.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the ambassador, “ frmol ” was not just the presidency, however, and the subsequent financial crisis, which is addressed to date.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, has yet to approve the new seven - year EU budget, which is precisely because of the current economic situation complicates matters greatly.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the ambassador czechs have a reputation of eurosceptics and people who are noticing more negative than positive aspects of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, it pains low representation of the Czechs in the european institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The culprit, according to her a lot of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write letters to the motive, but also the low support from the party.</seg>

<seg id="31">As a very real then sees the concept of a two - speed, if not a multi - speed Europe, rather than a new “ european federation. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">“ We have here a country in the euro area and the countries outside the euro. ”</seg>
<seg id="33">“ We have the Schengen area, we have and the Institute of enhanced cooperation. ”</seg>
<seg id="34">“ For the first time, it was said, they are working only countries that want to, and those who do not want to see whether stand idly by. ”</seg>
<seg id="35">“ Those institutions will be more, and it will be a two - speed Europe, ” expected Vicenová.</seg>

<seg id="1">Story: Brand</seg>
<seg id="2">Inovátor IBM begins the second century of existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If someone searched for a word, which accurately express strategy of IBM, the closest would be “ long - term aspect. ”</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public to IBM, a symbol of the technology revolution, is that the firm was seen as a very contemporary, and yet from its inception has passed a hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this long - term laid the first head of the company 's visionary, Thomas J. Watson sr.</seg>
<seg id="6">He no longer forging a slogan that many of the world 's problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan “ Think! ” happen otiskem, around which will take on a life of future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine, which in IBM has already started to come back in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">It was also the basis for Watson carefully built corporate culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">“ For us the IBM means long - term thinking continuous movement towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and prospered a hundred years, due to the fact that has remained true to its fundamental values and at the same time was not afraid of everything else around change.</seg>
<seg id="11">This allowed us during our first centuries to transform technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second hundred that manage to achieve even more, ” remarked on the anniversary of the current head of the firm 's Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The sophisticated system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson in the 1930s, made to care for their employees like businessman Baťa finely - people from IBM should as some of the first american employees paid leave, insurance from their employer plus elegant employee his uniform and the sophisticated system to reward the best inventors, and traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a sophisticated has long - term IBM and the relationship with the customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company has been since the beginning of the brilliance in the exploitation of the talent - as one of the first global companies canceled any discrimination, so I could pick.</seg>
<seg id="17">In accordance with the strategy of anti - discrimination is the current plan, that Palmisana headed IBM in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">At IBM has been operating for more than 30 years, still holds the position of borrowed from the head of sales, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in recent years is doing so - called jamy, online brainstormingy, of which there is a lot of future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is no surprise that the ideas are enough - in a company working almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Institutions with good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The firm 's position in the business of providing the company' s strong internal and external image.</seg>
<seg id="23">“ From the beginning, IBM was the concept of institutions, rather than just technology companies, ” said Economistu professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on the IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">“ IBM is not a technology company, but firm, which helps solve byznysové problems for the use of technology, ” said George Colony of the consultancy firm Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself says, is the difference between the market and enter the market straight to create.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - aka “ the Great Blue ”, as it is for its logo in the United States familiérně dubbed - for a hundred years, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is probably nejvšestrannější technology company, is developing the hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting and consultancy services in the range of products from websites for nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">Holds most of patents from all US technology companies and five of its staff received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among its inventions belongs to the ATM, payment card, financial swap, a bar code or disketa.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year has become the second - largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, surpassed Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations have trefily to taste customers and time - IBM, for example, nepovedla bet on its own operating system axes / 2, online services prodigy or computer IBM PCjr.</seg>
<seg id="33">“ If your business is built to move forward, you cannot be emotionally focus on the past, ” poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM does not have a problem to build its foundations on many platforms - and when not working, so it is to leave.</seg>
<seg id="35">The difference to be from rival Microsoft, which essentially stands or falls on the Windows operating system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Promising technology</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In sales, IBM is most engaged the services, after roughly a fifth of is a software and hardware.</seg>
<seg id="38">Meanwhile, back in 1990, with more than half of the strongest representative of the hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">In investment continues even since 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM is according to the legacy of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the amount of investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">So far, it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis intact.</seg>
<seg id="43">The stock price of IBM since the beginning of 2008 has risen by rocket 120 per cent, net profit companies continually rising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Corporate slogan, IBM is changing everything, not just its values.</seg>
<seg id="45">We can therefore expect that, even when the next crisis, this giant flexible it will do.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="53">The leader then were overshadowed by the founder of the IBM - on Watsonových thoughts is not yet built invincible corporate culture and identity.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson held firm until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name suggests, starting with the production and sale of various kinds of machinery for business - from kráječů meat and cheese for treasuries.</seg>

<seg id="57">Watson was for the company as indispensable, that after almost 40 years in šéfovském seat it was followed by his son, Thomas Watson junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM has started work on the development of artificial intelligence, made the first programming language.</seg>

<seg id="60">In the meantime, in 1964, developed by IBM 's first family of computers - a series of IBM System / 360.</seg>
<seg id="61">Classic “ pécéčko, ” which has brought about a standard computer then, with the title of the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought konzultantskou part of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to fully pay advice and services with high value - added.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, which has in the past three years, IBM pays - is the concept of Smarter planets, “ Smarter Planet ”.</seg>
<seg id="64">Its aim is to the smart use of technology in still need or unintended areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport, or the management of the cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">For the trade has introduced recently IBM Smarter Commerce “ platform ”, which traders helps manage the business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a strong history in the home.</seg>
<seg id="67">Its subsidiary, created in the former Czechoslovakia in 1932, as in the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1">How have evolved prices tour since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In 1989, was in the then - Czechoslovakia allowed only five state tourism offices: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The tour operator at the time, sold in the vast majority of cases, only selling holidays in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West has been very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists and travelling on holiday to the sea in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), to the Soviet Union (Crimea in Sochi on the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and in Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, then, however, the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, and the way the czech tourists in Yugoslavia have subsequently been very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The great paradox of socialism, then it was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (i. e., also Čechoslovákům) individually allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">In that case, like a citizen of Czechoslovakia individually to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, so he needed from this country zvací letter, not otherwise be individual way possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The tour operator at the time, offering and trips to the West, but it would need to stand in front of overnight with spacákem or be in the office “ well - known ”.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even so, however, was not out of the woods.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so - called FX promise, which was a condition for the trip to the West, has been granted a “ politically unreliable people ” who could travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Czechoslovakia 's currency is not freely convertible currency, without the promise of foreign currency and it was not possible to obtain funding currency (western) on the way to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">By far the most often, however, the Czechs to take holidays at home, which was the result of a large number of chat and chalup, which the Czechs pořizovali and this custom survives to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Travel the Czechs and has experienced since 1989, the real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While in 1989 was leave in the GDR or Bulgaria our best last year spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A great irony that are already aware of what it is, in fact, that for us at the moment most popular Croatia was possible in 1989 to travel freely, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Early in the 1990 's, there has been a visa waiver to neighboring west european countries, which was triggered by a huge wave of short - term visits, above all, the austrian Vienna or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czechs and Slovaks has long could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone there would at least for a moment look.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris sleeping trips the Czechs in parks in tents, because our then - income nedovolovaly, so that we can pay for a hotel or penzion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of travel Czechs was in this time of vození own food banks, salámů, etc., in order to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible, the czech koruna, thus our tourists could, finally, after many years destítkách freely buy western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living, and with that, however, the average pay rise, which ended around 1997 in another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel to travel agents regularly since 1997 to prepare for trips charterovými air spoji, making air travel because of the possibility of nasmlouvat quantitative sales compared with the past incredibly less expensive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the 1990s, we should have the Czechs visa - free travel in virtually all of the world 's advanced countries, in addition to the US, which continues to facilitate our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of post - revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when he was due to the significant demand vypraven from the Czech Republic 's first ever direct charter to exotiky, it was in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">From this year, so every year vylétávají with czech tourists direct chartery into warm distant countries, this year 's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic in the twelve exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Exotic countries currently visiting already around 100,000 Czechs per year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting moment in this period, which stands for our post - revolutionary development, came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">17 November 2008 abolished the US visa for czech tourists and this is our country definitively as one of the most advanced countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, also for the first time in the history of the Czechs have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%), and for the first time in the history of it spent on one foreign holidays, including the cost of the whereabouts of more than 15 tis. Kč per person.</seg>

<seg id="7">But in an era of after Haškovi football slipped lately back to tit between the two chambers of the former, which was unable to agree on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Most of it is shown on 16 September, when a new president should be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates at the shareholders meeting in the national house in Prague on Smíchově sjeli unnecessarily, since the negotiations remained blocked and this was not just a way of elections.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is not a consensus, who has the right to a pile of actually vote - if only the statutory representatives, or even officials mandated full power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In the only point since then a partial agreement, which will also help the recommendations of the constitution for the state and the right to representation on the basis of a full power is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">The disputes but still exists about the electoral law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Too much clarity on the situation and introduce an executive committee, who is no longer on their negotiations, whether proper or emergency, does not in fact nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="14">A glance at the choice has changed several times, but neuralgický point is still the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to ruled out the possibility of stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“ The dispute is whether to be in line with the statutes, or to find a different model, ” said one of the three vice - presidents FAČR Dusan Liberty, which in leadership Association represents professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round of the wins the most of the candidates, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, for which is running.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is said to be ready to go at the concession that won the candidate who gets higher sum per cent of votes from both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the party is pushing for a condition that the winner must in the percentage of the census to gain at least a two - thirds advantage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">“ But this would then pozbývala sense of two previous rounds, it would be completely negate a bicameral concept, ” sees the objections moravské Party freedom, under which it would be the best law neohýbat and to vote under the existing statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With the somewhat surprisingly agrees and Tomas Paclík, although it is estimated that 's designed to allow the election law suits from all the candidates most Peltovi.</seg>
<seg id="22">“ I wish to decide upon a maximum according to the constitution. ”</seg>
<seg id="23">“ To some espousing nonsense nevymýšlely as the last general meeting, ” said owner of Victoria plzeň, who is running for the first time and in your comments are defined by, in particular, against Peltovi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Nymburce according to him, will be the new chairman of I know and believe that the candidates will in future work constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">“ All the passion to reassure potential of today 's action as a national team at the European Championships. ”</seg>
<seg id="27">“ Football, in turn, will be a lucky streak, will have a greater willingness to cooperate, ” means jablonecký leader myself, which has three of the largest of the whole experience of managing a football as a professional, and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is restrained.</seg>
<seg id="29">“ I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is a lot of torn apart. ”</seg>
<seg id="30">“ This is not among the people of the Czech and Moravia, but there are efforts by the ring to adapt to the legislation. ”</seg>
<seg id="31">“ It can cause that to deadlock on shareholders meeting will happen again. ”</seg>
<seg id="32">“ However, I hope that common sense will prevail, ” said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The agreement of all parties have much time left.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some of the negotiations, were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows, whether in the struggle will be football generalita not complete.</seg>
<seg id="35">The aviation speciál, in which should go to Podgorice, among other things, the Vice - presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, from Prague due to a technical disorder morning neodletěl and to look for is spare option, as part of the Executive Committee in the scenes of barážové retribution again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Perhaps in the end will be decisive meeting at ministerial level, which can be reported on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">The education minister, youth and tělovýchovy Joseph Dobeš would like to make divided parties within the strongest sports associations in the country to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">At stake is a lot of things: the state subsidies, the credibility of the football and also planned a pile of the vast ČSTV, which will address the new direction of the sport after financial problems sazky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík goes to fight on the president, because they cannot see a suitable candidate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the head of the players' plzně Tomas Paclík before a large pile of extraordinary saw a strong candidate who would comply with all his ideas for a new chairman of the football associations of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor in the battle for the top post sign up.</seg>
<seg id="41">“ If there is a high - quality adept, bojuju for him and the election of nejdu. ”</seg>
<seg id="42">“ But in the current situation is not such a failed to find, ” said ČTK Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the runoff with Miroslav Peltou and Jindřichem Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Peltovi, alleged favoritovi elections, tried to avoid in the road to lead FAČR.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also points out that, in the case of his victory in the role of the President lasted only until 2013, when it is on the agenda of the General Assembly of the good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this post, I would like to see in the future, as an experienced and top executive, who is not connected with the football events.</seg>
<seg id="46">“ With some of the people who would come in the account, I talked to you. ”</seg>
<seg id="47">“ For me it was crazy, though some said that at this point, with the czech football don 't want to identify. ”</seg>
<seg id="48">“ That I would like to change, ” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Paclíkovi supposedly now most of all it bothers Peltovo connections with the President of plzeňského Regional football association Berbrem Romano, a man with a reputation as a controversial, which is behind the scenes, known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates at the general meeting.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclíka is so unacceptable to Pelta appeared in the position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">“ If he won, so the zakonzervuje the status quo and nothing would have in football moved forward. ”</seg>
<seg id="52">“ In combination with the support of Berbra, which is zdatným trader, would that football was not even more, ” said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Alluding to the fact that Peltovo name years ago said in tapping in the investigation of corruption affair, from which Pelta, however, came without punishment.</seg>
<seg id="54">“ I do not know what the prestige of the football Peltovo victory would bring. ”</seg>
<seg id="55">“ And as we also looked in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA, ” said Paclík, which already but also takes with grace its earlier statement that would “ plzeňský sold the club to Pelta became prime. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the event that the Paclík in Thursday 's election triumph, could do but with Peltou envision the future cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="57">The same thinking and another candidate Rajchl, which supported zářijovou Paclík before a large pile of, which ended in failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">“ He (Pelta) would be the first, for whom I would go. ”</seg>
<seg id="59">“ It has a great ability. ”</seg>
<seg id="60">“ Could I would imagine it to be as the head of representation. ”</seg>
<seg id="61">“ But manažersky would follow Association has failed. ”</seg>
<seg id="62">“ I also nestrkám nose where it I can 't, ” said Paclík, which in September, has received a great deal of attention to the fact that he was behind the cancellation of the Commission' s rozhodčích in the head with Luďkem Macelou, which replaced Dagmar Damková.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík argue that would lead to the association.</seg>
<seg id="64">It refers to the ability of management of private companies, since last summer also heads the educational, which with its support in May celebrated premiérový ligový triumph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">“ I have the strength to take in the football environment something changed, so that contributed to his some cultivation. ”</seg>
<seg id="66">“ To limit the effects of certain interest groups, which must have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which goes to the unsavoury situations, ” said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to sparťanskému boss Daniel křetínskému.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one of the priorities would also found the tightening of relations with the czech FAČR Olympic Committee, through which it for political leaders lobbied for it, to get into the sport has received more money from loterijní taxes.</seg>
<seg id="68">“ This is one of the key things that should be the new chairman of pay. ”</seg>
<seg id="69">“ If it comes to the taxation of hazard to declare their political parties, so I understand their argument, but frankly to say where the money will go, ” said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">As a burden now Paclík takes nor its link with plzeňským club, though he claims that the President FAČR should be “ bipartisan ”.</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta, meanwhile, is associated with Jabloncem, Rajchl with the Prague Duklou.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised the new statutes FAČR, which would eliminate the election standoff</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta before zářijovou neuskutečněnou choice has promised that the entertainment and obtaining financing, if elected, intends to focus on.</seg>

<seg id="120">“ For those two years, has done a great deal of work, and I do not want to now be scrapped. ”</seg>
<seg id="121">“ They are nastartované processes, which will have a resonance to for a couple of years, and I would not like to be stopped, ” he said to the concern that, in the case of the election of the next candidate Miroslav Pelty, said the situation at the Union could return in time before Haškem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">“ I believe in a systematic way, and this is something that I think Mirek Pelta cannot. ”</seg>
<seg id="123">“ For him, in particular, are navázáni people who would do the football, so that it was only for those vyvolené. ”</seg>
<seg id="124">“ I can say a lot of things, but it certainly will not be with all that someone. ”</seg>
<seg id="125">“ I try to be objective. ”</seg>
<seg id="126">“ I want to do football for all, because then they will be all well and not just those vyvolení, ” remarked Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">Refutes the claim that it was only the Czech Prime.</seg>
<seg id="128">“ Even though some people are trying to argue otherwise, so I plan to do for Moravia everything. ”</seg>
<seg id="129">“ For example, it is time to think about it, that would be the second League split on the Czech and moravskou part, whose winners would go into the first League. ”</seg>
<seg id="130">“ There has been, so the current situation, when they are in the league of only three moravské units, which is a problem in the direction of the young players in Moravia, ” said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">As the fight over President involved, and the chief of plzeňského club Tomas Paclík, netroufá am Rajchl guess his chances in the election.</seg>
<seg id="132">“ But still I feel strong support in the chamber, which I chose as his vice - president, and that to me is the clear successes, ” said Rajchl, which for their achievements sees saving tens of millions of poor kronor on contracts negotiated television contracts and negotiations on loterijním law.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the contrary, it has been complicit in it, that the union netáhne to pull together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While the Peltovi says that it is “ disqualified from it, to back the confidence of football ”, another contender Paclíka is considered a strong candidate, which is what football has to offer.</seg>
<seg id="135">“ No one can dispute that, in educational over this year has done an excellent job. ”</seg>
<seg id="136">“ If it were to be elected, so perhaps continued in those matters that have kick - started Ivan Hašek and does not materially, remained unchanged staffing in commissions. ”</seg>
<seg id="137">“ I would shake their in their favour, ” assesses rivals Rajchl.</seg>

<seg id="10">This is the result of the exit polls from the Forsa mandated consumer organisations Foodwatch.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="23">Whether Ackermann as top bank lobbyist to honor obligations.</seg>
<seg id="24">“ Deutsche Bank must cut from its portfólia all the items, which are used for money bets on food prices, ” Bode said.</seg>
<seg id="25">“ Irrespective of whether Mr Ackermannovi for people suffering from hunger or on the reputation of Deutsche Bank. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Ackermannův view appears to be at first glance, as a surprise, but it is clear that koncernový head for a few months before his departure from office, I left the perfect picture.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, Deutsche Bank has announced that the head of the board of directors differently than planned, to the supervisory board go away.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">When horuje for modern architecture, the post - war for clear forms, glass factory, courageous rozmachy and new construction materials, which are typical of faith in the technical advances, then it is the austrian Pavilion architect Charles Schwanzera for Brussels World exhibition 1958 succinct and famously example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzerův Pavilion received then Grand Prix d 'Architecture for its light and vznosně operating the construction of the steel and glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction is still seen as a milestone of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Famous for the architect, also for the next World Expo Pavilion built of Austria.</seg>

<seg id="12">But the building was not appropriate for the museum, or space or technically - were missing from the walls for pegging the art objects, no satisfactory for the climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yet it was used, as long as the art of any new kiosk in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and chátrala more and more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now architect Adolf Krischanitz Pavilion to rebuild, now carries the title of “ the House of the 21st century ” and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>

<seg id="22">Not only that, in a sensible way to rebuild and expand secesní construction of Joseph Olbricha in Vienna and won the competition, but because Schwanzera studied at the University of Vienna and technical Pavilion for him was “ an extremely important place ”, in which “ almost every weekend, ” examining the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the ancestral project and also knows the problems of the building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change the use of lost on their generosity and ease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current reconstruction have been far greater problems: the building was “ katapultem for energy, ” says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">Profiles of window glass facades were replaced, used glass fibre vyztužené insulating glass and skleněná roof will be replaced by a special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Chladové bridges - steel nosníky were stepped up or replaced, and asbestos fill out ceilings rescued.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two underground floor provide room for new uses, zapuštěný lighting the channel between the building and street lighting, extends to the entrance leads stone - almost novostavba, but still vznosný Schwanzerův pavilón.</seg>

<seg id="30">And all of this with a strict supervision památkového office and low - budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">“ Often had to be found material, which is good and cheap and I also liked the památkovému office, ” says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor suterénu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, the problems and the reconstruction of the building remains flexible and birds.</seg>
<seg id="33">Difficult it was supposedly with pavilonem, “ who came here from Brussels, ” said recently Krischanitz, a typical “ drop - in - the - City - history. ”</seg>
<seg id="34">Such architecture, is “ always on the wrong place ” and still wants to “ give the proper self - confidence. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, but it is not a house of the 21st century on nepatřičném ground, as occurred urban happy coincidence: in the circle around Schweizer Garten, a completely new projektovaná “ urban neighborhood at the station ” with kancelářskými and residential homes.</seg>
<seg id="36">And perhaps even more there will be other things to chance: the house of the 21st century could receive support from other Krischanitzovy construction, as sběratelka Francesca von Habsburg 's purchase of Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how it is heard, now dealing with the city on the neighbourhood to habitats in Garten Schweizer.</seg>

<seg id="1">The bank scandal in curyšského Lake</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nejdobrodružnější Bank has headquarters in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">UBS has suffered in the financial crisis, almost bankruptcy and since then sliding down from one crisis to another.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it has a german compare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Axel Weber certainly thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his noisy departure for the leadership of the Federal Bank happened in July, a well - known that arrives in 2013 almost as spektakulárního new job: President of the Board of the swiss velkobanky UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in their careers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber has enjoyed publicly praised the Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired the solidity and said friendly comments to future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">“ Die UBS has reached a turning point ”.</seg>
<seg id="9">“ I look forward to working with Kasparem Villigerem and Oswaldem Grübelem. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September, it was clear that everything will not be otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="11">One dealer from UBS in London has circumvented all safety systems of banks and around 1.7 billion euro zmarnil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The head of the board of directors, Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland a respected banker, had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">The president of the board of UBS is since then, as well as opařený - and we all ask: when finally comes, Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Already has become a well - known that Weber Bank since February 2012 may advise.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the board will take over the presidency in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday to tell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber this will be hard.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker, a professor of economics and emission banker and certainly would not have time to translate the needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then suddenly, will assume responsibility for the banks, which, in turn, could have just one that deserves the title of “ the bank 's biggest scandals in Europe ”</seg>
<seg id="19">As UBS is both a huge - until recently was the biggest wealth manager in the world - and sliding down, on the other hand, has for years from one to another scandal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, is proud of the Swiss Bank spared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2007 to enjoy excellent UBS 's reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of mlčenlivého and solid, but also vychytralého manager property is combined with the ambitious goals: would also mean anything in investment banking.</seg>
<seg id="24">So it managed UBS 2007 on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And, on the other hand, a move as an investment bank in the league of the world 's biggest banks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">That was the impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">A former banker and later a long - term banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: “ my students at the time I always UBS cited as a model of good banks. ”</seg>
<seg id="28">“ From today 's perspective, one asks: how I could so wrong? ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It was wrong considerably.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, it was clear that for the first time, something in the UBS properly gone wrong.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year, resigned, surprisingly, the head of the board of directors, Peter Wuffli, which so far has been seen as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant bankers.</seg>
<seg id="32">For a few months later I knew why he left.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment bank division has wasted Subprime - Securities and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">For it to defend, UBS is recommending the capital increase of really 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">It found a really investors, however, such that the recently even ohrnovala nose: opaque asian sovereign fund from Singapore and arab state fund, which was so discreet, that one man or nedověděl his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But this was just the first crash.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to admit a new billion - dollar losses, president of the board of Marcel Ospel, 2006 a second best - paid Board of Switzerland, to step down.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, followed by the disaster: UBS was due to his bad investments in the financial crisis, before they collapsed and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of questionable securities, the Swiss Confederation, has six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, which could become a spolumajitelkou banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole of Switzerland was shaken - as we noted, as is dramatic for a small country, though he has on its territory and big banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland (see picture).</seg>
<seg id="43">“ Once again we could save the UBS ”, says the banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">On the first disaster follows the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">For several months to have capitulated UBS in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to extradite data wealthy customers, who as possible with the help of banks krátili taxes.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, agreed with the payment of $780 million - as the return of unjustified profits from these stores including pokutové surcharges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The UBS has more or less openly that aided by cutting taxes.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time, it has lost something, what has always been its capital in the competition for the rich clients: svatozář discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After this scandal has already been the swiss banking secrecy what earlier.</seg>
<seg id="50">It followed the resignation of the head of the board of directors and president of the board.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of the money customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So the bank has lost in the space of a few months, their credibility in both core business areas: in the investment banking because of the bad speculation and in wealth management for helping to make cuts in taxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when it is a bit reassured, just when we thought that UBS will pick up again, here comes the ill - fated trade anabáze: a single dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euros before the Bank zpozorovala, that something is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking it probably still must be wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">“ The case is about Adoboli discovered that control of the risks of too little has changed, ” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at Finanz banking Institute University Zürich.</seg>
<seg id="56">As well as financial director of the big german banks is certain: “ UBS problem lies in the fact that dealing with the control of risk. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He was, after all, is the idea of a caution that start off on the swiss bankers a long time ago to become the guardians of large holdings of the world: no too much risk, but security for money - also from this side of the Alpine republic, collapsed in the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">Trezory swiss banks have become the symbol of an unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high - quality chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">UBS headquarters in Zurich is more suited to the clichés of good swiss private banks - is just a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="60">No location is a classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has its main headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to curyšskému jezeru, which is framed zasněženými peak in the swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Klenotnictví as Tiffany 's to find between the swiss traditional stores such as ice Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries, here is the home of swiss banks: from Nationalbank despite Palast der Credit Suisse after an elite private banks such as Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The receptionist halls UBS to enter the heavy otáčivými doors.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside, the walls are obložené mramorem, in front of them a massive kožená seats, in addition to the logo big banks směrovka to “ safety deposit box. ”</seg>
<seg id="67">UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of swiss banks both swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - out or they let down, as the head of finding one small swiss private banks.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name would rather he did not want to read in the newspapers, finally closes, as all swiss bankers, also with two velkobankami shops.</seg>
<seg id="70">UBS is perhaps too grown, finds - particularly in investment banking, where the extra spread anglosasové.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss may have to have something to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">“ And if, after all, adapt to the long Anglo - Saxon ways. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, which UBS changed, leave it initially high profits and then disaster: no european financial Institute have not lost in the jungle around Subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">15 October 2008 disaster was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="75">“ In the heart of the next coalition government, the country 's largest small sedmimilionové to rescue action in the history of our nation, ” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “ Der UBS - crash ”.</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euro approved politicians to rescue from bankruptcy - velkobanku.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How can this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If talks with the swiss bankers, so they can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, have come together two of the three swiss velkobank into massive group.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank, which is already in a merger was too large to small Switzerland - and still continue to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Meanwhile, benefited from that, with two different bank UBS predecessors complement: one rich, but ospalá Bank in Zurich with the focus in wealth management and poorer, but internationally heavily involved.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly lost internacionalizovaní investment bankers conveniently to many money with which we can make a lot of roulette.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">With the rise of UBS are linked the two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.</seg>
<seg id="84">“ I have always thought that Wuffli Ospel and are the team of the future, ” says banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">“ Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, that knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, one driven by sentiment around the stomach, which from banking science has produced entirely up. ”</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel, he argues, to the end of relied on Wuffliho.</seg>
<seg id="87">And Wuffli was probably made at the end of a crucial mistakes: “ perhaps the thought that his models are a reality, ” Geiger said.</seg>
<seg id="88">“ This is a tragic case. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">What is clear: the hubris of prior to the crash.</seg>
<seg id="91">UBS employees are clearly recall the meetings of the directors on which koncernový chief Wuffli repeated again and again the same slogan: bring the Goldman Sachs of mines.</seg>
<seg id="92">The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">She was saying “ League Tables ”, the waiting list, which documents the success of the banks of that time.</seg>
<seg id="94">It has sought to UBS on the location of the very top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">A few steps it has succeeded in.</seg>
<seg id="96">In trading in the currency and stock was part of the game is up.</seg>
<seg id="97">Corporate advisers, who have been charged with stress, however, one weakness: úrokovém in international trade, in the language of the bankers “ Fixed income ”, perhaps there is a big gap for the biggest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">UBS has some gaps in US hypotéčních products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To close the gap, determined to UBS to adventure, which it almost cost existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, investing as the bank itself and it - based fund to ensure the risk to US investment Subprime.</seg>
<seg id="101">Has unfolded in a massive machine, which securities přebaloval on America 's mortgage loans and to further - but I also himself left it risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Also, even when other banks have long sought a way out.</seg>
<seg id="103">“ Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, where UBS buy ”, says the banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">How much is eufórie, so deep a fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">One manager for the second had to go, when attempts to ease a were more difficult than had been thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">The position at UBS have become katapultovacím seats and to now be houpou.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Who leads velkobanku now has almost to reduce work.</seg>
<seg id="108">Must find a strategy for the bank, which all near business models have disappeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banking expert Geiger has no idea: the end with the investment banking, the concentration of wealth management, a return to the swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">Not so much the Bank is (still) wants to go.</seg>
<seg id="111">But investment - banking has severely cut, so it is now clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">Next Thursday, wants the new head of the bank 's Sergio Ermotti to present the world its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">The 51 - year old swiss italian has been seen, in fact, not only as an interim solution, though, the bank surprisingly rozešla with the predecessor Grübelem.</seg>
<seg id="114">In the meantime, pushed through a: has long - term deals to lead UBS, told curyšská Bank on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants the investment bank to put back on the situation in the mid - 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">3 500 places a dent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But it will not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">What it wants to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that Axel Weber has now asked.</seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly but still says only that they had their Mrs ahead of a flat in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The massacre at a personal level</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">An emotionally strong new book, Peter Englunda with “ the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War (the Beauty and the Sorrow: an Intimate History of the First World War) begins a long list of speakers characters, when you from this zatočí Head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">One piece of advice, as they are in the moment: be careful to maintain this page vytrhněte and make it záložku.</seg>
<seg id="4">All those, in románovém narrative Mr Englunda very well and look at this list you will serve as a beacon of navigation - as - at a time when they are the same as men and women in the story, you will feel confused and missing in various situations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Mr Englund is a swedish historian and journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">The book, which have been talking about here is very unusual - author himself has described it, rather aptly, as “ antihistorickou work. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains a number of very well - known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, in her nearly missing ambassadors, energetic, journalists and the debate about tactics and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as “ a book about what it was all about. ” discusses “ feelings impressions, experiences and moods. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">“ The beauty and sorrow ” combines war experiences 20 more or less tuctových men and women, on both sides of the divide, from students and botaniků after horolezce, doctors, drivers záchranek and officials.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people have become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others will become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, zblázní or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives are mihotají as flames of candles fervent in church - new added to spletence fates, while other uhasínají.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book Mr Englunda from classic historical novels differ.</seg>
<seg id="15">Regulates the idea that the First World War was just about the horrific entrenched fighting on the western front.</seg>
<seg id="16">“ The beauty and sorrow ” zručně prozkoumává and other places where there was a wartime dramas: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, eastern Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soldiers in this book solves the problems with this, that they are falling bee hive, must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or are struggling with the presence of tse - tse flies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Almost from the beginning, this is a very moving reading.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war be absorbed in the lives of people like a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina páchnoucí střelným dust.</seg>
<seg id="20">When in the distance starts shooting raised from the works and you are a woman who is at home with their children, utečete or stay?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who is this actually coming?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one understands what is happening, not even that, why was the war unleashed.</seg>
<seg id="23">“ The vacuum created from a lack of facts, ” he observed Mr Englund, “ has been filled by estimates, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudice, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fámami. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">“ The beauty and sorrow ” follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Nightingale Farmboroughová, english nurse in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the flotilla.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are all přebírány of biographies, letters and other already published materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Descriptions of their lives can be scary and poutavě, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are absolutely living and believable.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them about suffering and dealing with him.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the story of a german author says: “ substitutes, all the substitutes. ”</seg>
<seg id="29">“ Substitute for a coffee, imitation, going aluminium, imitation gumy, paper obvazy, wooden knoflíky. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Goes even further, describing a substitute for eating in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">It refers to the “ meat vyrobeném from pressed rice vařené in mutton fat (and supplemented by a false bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried bramborových slupek, shoes with wood podrážkami. ”</seg>
<seg id="32">Mentions that there were “ 837 registered artificial meat in the production of párků and 511 registered a coffee. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are about honor and bravery.</seg>
<seg id="34">One American in itself is internal incentives to divokosti and brutality, and then on the war says: “ at the end of the day, you will understand that it is human nature. not sit in a comfortable seats with a cigarette and whisky, večerními newspapers or a good book and pretend that this your Mask is a civilisation and that behind this škrobeným I in the heart of the secret of the fact no barbar. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">On the contrary, a british soldier is aware of that, with the greatest probability soon die and no one has even won 't notice, let alone to mourning.</seg>
<seg id="36">“ When you finally reconciled that is sacrificed, waited at least, that will happen in front of vděčného audience, ” she writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, however, find it as “ convict who secretly oběsí. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the advent of new horrors.</seg>
<seg id="39">“ The conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competition, ” writes Mr Englund, “ the war between the factories. ”</seg>
<seg id="40">Received what is called “ a new sort of beast 's: výřečný and ideologically a staunch serial killer in Chanel střižených for peace, which carries out its bloodshed without rising from the table. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave quite unexpectedly, vileness, alternating with hrdinstvím.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Englund describes, soldiers, who is from prostitutes deliberately tried to catch some sexual disease, to avoid service at the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">“ Nejgrotesknějším example of this behavior was trading gonokokovým hnisem that soldiers were buying and curb the genitálie it in the hope that they will end up in the hospital, ” she writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">“ Those are the most desperate vtírali even in the eye, which is often oslepilo until the end of life. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation from švédštiny from Peter Gravese is próza Mr Englunda speedy, but not ostentatious, which is well suited to his human subject.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small output captures the way in which the war unleashed a “ totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, religious hatred. ”</seg>
<seg id="47">People are starting to ask, why is their leaders to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books of the First World War, for the most part, rather than with the complex of a work with signs such as “ the First World War and the modern memories ” from Paul Fussella or a novel like “ all quiet on the western front ” from, Erich Maria Remarquea.</seg>
<seg id="49">Mr Englund prefers nekonvenčnímu concept.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book is the most devastating conclusion, as in populárně naučné literature is unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="51">You will, however, I will not be revealing.</seg>
<seg id="52">You will, however, find, as would suddenly jumped from the book 's author, vytrhl you side from the list of heroes of the eye and set it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Unions representing hundreds of school aid workers, who last month have lost their jobs, on Wednesday plan to prosecute the city, saying that the layoffs were necessary, and it was about discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, which are visiting the poor students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Court cases is probably the last option, which trade unions in the area of District Council 37 remains, in their efforts to overturn the decision of dismissal.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the City Council, which took place last month, said the education minister Dennis M. Walcott, that layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the members of the Council immediately countered by saying that, in the budget is not mentioned anywhere in particular about the release of the aid workers.</seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="9">Obžalovanými in the process, Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while prosecuting party will be eight redundancies, all of whom are afroameričany or hispánci, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomasová, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said that the city still have not seen before, and therefore to the accusations will not comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, with trade unions to focus on the number of redundancies in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claims of unfair negotiation. hold the view that the poor schools have lost more assistants, because they are already in the long term are deprived of adequate funding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">They point out that while in schools in parts of Staten Iceland nepropouštělo at all and in parts of the Upper East Side minimally, in Brooklynu, in part of the District 23 in Brownsville, have lost their jobs 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, there were even 46 assistants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A reminder that in the School of Public School 36 in Harlem work lost five of eight assistants, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. indictment says: “ this is not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents, who may come from the financial resources to compensate for the shortfall in the budget. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The budget of the school, Public School 36 was reduced this year on 3,26 per cent and the school also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating bonusových finance for each přihlášeného poor student.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Unions argue, among other things, that the directors of the secondary schools could be confused by the way in which it was written document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the document was coined to describe the actions used the word “ excess ”, that is, to lift the position, even though that word is more often used to describe the shift of teachers from a charter school in a database available workers, whose salary is paid for by a central authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">“ Sixty - six parental coordinators have been released, ” the motion states complaints, “ and not only moved into the database for the position of the available workers. ”</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">Over the years, lawmakers from both parties are constantly arguing among themselves and with the White House on the wording of a series of statements for approval, or the military 's refusal to the role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, presented to Kerry and McCain resolution authorized the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">A proposal in the House was rejected because of the differing views of both political parties, so it is in the Senate never vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But the same day, when he was in the House rejected this proposal, the House rejected the measure, which would put an end to the financing of US operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is America 's mission in Libya was literally in the legislative očistci - Congress criticised the way in which President Obama directs the mission, but its members of this apparently nedráždilo so much to him in his actions to support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The hesitancy of Congress eventually overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rebels captured Tripoli in August and 20 October was killed Gaddafi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Later, the mission officially ended on 31 October.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is now the Senate may be ready to act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The Commission for international relations in a statement “ congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and the remarkable resilience, which have invested in an attempt to free his people ” and “ commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its allies, who have been involved in the operation to protect the libyan population, for the extraordinary bravery and professionalism. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In a statement, also “ confirms the national interest of the United States for a successful and nezvratném transition to democracy in Libya. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new proposal will have the full support of the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators again divided into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June draft?</seg>
<seg id="20">Against the latest version of standing up to Senator Richard G. Lugar (IND), the main representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lugarův spokesperson on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has not yet seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the House, will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be a top legislative priority almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlattem (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or else the topic on which will vote in the House or the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other lawmakers have so far, despite considerable efforts have failed in their proposals through all the way up to the vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Goodlattův proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution, which were introduced in Congress and apply to a wide range of different topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some of them were the same - same proposal put forward by the House and Senate, and others are only small variations of the other.</seg>
<seg id="27">Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of an amendment to a balanced budget and a handful of others, which would like to “ regulate federal spending. ”</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the proposals are not the same thing, but their supporters - especially the onset of Republicans, who want to improve its image - can brag about their “ ownership ”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, demanded that the addition of a balanced budget vote in the House and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators voted in favor of non - binding declaration of support for the creation of such an amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In addition to the budget wants to several members also discuss the limit on the number of times, in which members of Congress could serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N. Y.) wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the office of the president.</seg>
<seg id="32">Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a series of amendments that would, among other things, guaranteeing the right to a quality education and medical care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A proposal remains amendment banning same - sex marriage and the addition of banning the burning national flag.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancelling of federal laws in the case against them will stand up to two - thirds of the states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although it seems that are members of Congress in the design of the various amendments very active, compared with previous years, however, it does not significantly nevybočují of average.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 111. Congress offered 77 additions, while in 100. Congress was 66.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics, the Senate members of libraries offer every two years, more than 150 amendments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Not, however, a much more successful than the current politicians.</seg>
<seg id="39">The last amendment, which has been added - 27. rider - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was designed by Congress in 1789.</seg>

<seg id="9">I am sure that the organizers thought well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I know that, yes.</seg>
<seg id="11">But what I saw was not respect. it was a pity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">So completely opposite impressions just illustrate the uneasy relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the american public.</seg>

<p>

<seg id="17">“ It seems that the only way to some of us can support, is to put us in the position of the unfortunate soul. ”</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">This issue is very sensitive to the army commanders, who do not want to look like nevděčně or harm relations with the public, which serves.</seg>
<seg id="19">We also recognize that anger, which have had to face the troops returning from Vietnam, once was much worse.</seg>

<seg id="1">The army is facing growing pressure to crack down on the use of rape</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week to determine whether it will be launched a judicial process 28 women and men against the army due to alleged inaction in the case of rape.</seg>
<seg id="3">If not, they are prepared to file a lawsuit, hundreds of other applicants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Vojínovi Class Elizabeth Lymanové was at night, when it was allegedly raped by a colleague from the army, 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="5">It happened in October 2008 and she was flowing into the barracks on the air base of Miramar north of San Diego. after dinner with crony hits on her male colleague hand a box with 12 pivy.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked her whether it can add, that would make it to the room to a little popít.</seg>
<seg id="7">“ In Title I came on warning light, ” described Lymanová.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the native Texasan its objections completely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: no, he is 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">“ It is from Texas, ” she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">“ I wish I listened to his instincts. ”</seg>
<seg id="12">Claims that only a few minutes after went into her room, a man to come, threw her on the bed and rape.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, 18 November, will be Lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military 's wait for the verdict of the hearing, which could have a historic impact. this will take place in Arlington in Virginia and go in there about whether the allegations against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeldovi, gets up before the court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is at odds with the constitutional rights of soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Charges have been filed in February, the Washington lawyer Susan Burkeovou and the plaintiffs had at the time, 17 members. over the coming months, however, their numbers have grown to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all claim that they have been raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army, and the army after the announcement of these útků failed in the investigation, and any punishment for the pursuit of justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burkeová argues that it is for the neck of the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem begins just for them.</seg>
<seg id="17">“ The army is direktivním system, ” he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">“ Who are the people who are in a position to avoid an attempt to introduce measures against such things? high command. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burkeová also says that since February in contact with at least 400 other survivors, many of which of them could become part of the other lawsuits lodged in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">Its strategy: rather than to seskupila all of the charges in this case - naskládala all eggs in one basket, as she says - will sue in more different cases, if necessary, to pressure nepolevil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team for the Department of Defense is leading the state representative of the United States Neil MacBride, who, along with her colleagues instruct them to reject the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">The court documents, obtained by Newsweek stated in detail, pick up a strategy of defence, in principle, that current or former soldiers cannot army to sue for injuries, which have suffered as members of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the regulation of the Supreme Court from 1950 - called as the Feres Doctrine is the federal government responsible for injuries, which suffers soldiers in active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">“ The alleged injuries related to the military services denouncing, ” writes in the document.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Department of Defense has refused to comment on the matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">Although women still officially allowed to serve in combat, it was just about quibbles: in modern warfare is difficult to find a clear the battle lines.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with the civilian women about certain acts in the war zone.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between the wars there were 150 soldiers female - two - thirds of them directly in the fight.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now is the time to have to modernise and in the army, explains Burkeová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In their struggle is not alone in this case in hand on top of another three legal representatives.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Yale law school preparing visitors veteránského seminars on legal services lawsuit against the four main military academy for suspected of developing the atmosphere promoting hatred towards women.</seg>
<seg id="33">The non - profit organization vietnamese american veterans is collecting evidence for its claim of moving against the army. this complaint is focused on the diagnosis “ personality disorder ”, which was reportedly identified for victims of rape, that the army had an excuse for their release, according to activists, such as it is, for example, AMR Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women 's Action Network, it is a completely normal practice.</seg>
<seg id="34">Her group has already in December to make a proposal suing the state organisation for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for help from people who said they were in the service of sexually attacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In Congress was presented by nine separate proposals, which presented a group of senators and members of both political parties and put them in a series of redress.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the office for prevention and resolution of sexual violence from the Department of Defense, in 2010 there 3 158 sexual assaults.</seg>
<seg id="37">This type of attacks, however, remains in most cases neohlášen and, according to the Pentagon 's own estimates, this figure is equivalent to about 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a report issued in March, is dismantled the criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, the court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half compared to the civilian justice system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Prosecutors in the case of a representative of Burkeové describe attacks just as the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Private First Class Lymanová nahlásila, for example, the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">During the night, he says, has been asked to details about her rape reiterated 11 times the various members of the police, the doctors and the commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">Took all the necessary tests to determine the rape and in her bed was found blood - from wounds he has done on the arm.</seg>
<seg id="43">About six months later, in April 2009, is a graduate of Lymanová before a court hearing, during which it has been raised questions about whether, on the day of the attack she loved with my friend.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was předvoláno six people, which as witnesses on the reputation of vypovídaly in favour of the alleged perpetrators, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“ I remember the day when the judgment was handed down, ” says Lymanová.</seg>
<seg id="46">“ I had the feeling, that right there on the ground porodím - with screaming I vyběhla from the courtroom. ”</seg>
<seg id="47">“ We have put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I am my velícímu officer said: this was not his court. was mine. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lymanové directing to attend military psychiatrist, which it eventually diagnostikoval breakdown of the figures, which it described as incompetent to service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, from the army without honour and, therefore, even without the right to výsluhu released.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whatever the case Lymanové and other prosecutors will move on to the next phase, or not, we are there for the long haul, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of George Washington University.</seg>
<seg id="51">But, notes, “ from my point of view, should be able to move on to the next stage of the examination. ”</seg>
<seg id="52">Between them and the judgment, however, is the doctrine, which has come under fire from the first moment, what can see the light of day.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is a few decades behind, because their obligations neudávají adhere to the same level of a motivating incentives and deterrents to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: “ the chances are heavily against them … but it is important for them to try it. ”</seg>
<seg id="56">Change to occur only when they are good people willing to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, Burkevoá, lawyer denouncing, collected hundreds of other people ready to take legal action and will start work on other cases on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="58">“ We will not stop with the army in this fight, where there will be reform, ” he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">The walls have their eyes: scientists are exploring how you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Than Anders Behring Breivik has become the new face of right - wing extremism in Europe, it was just another young man, that its anti - immigration views presented on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Braivik, who has admitted to červencovému vraždícímu killing spree that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite Breivik could go it alone, in cyberspace is certainly not alone: during the attack spent a lot of time in front of a computer, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right - wing groups on social networking sites.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer with scientists want to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as it is to find?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easily - just to get out on Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“ We realised that we find them, are actually not that difficult, ” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of the recently published reports british research team, which was about the digital populism.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists were enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the site, and, thanks to this, with complete accuracy determine hledanou demographic group - something marketingoví workers are doing for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartlettův team across the whole of Europe find a half a million supporters of the right - wing groups, and then to focus attention and circulated them them ads. but instead, that is their through zvali into the newly established groups or offer any dietary products, is called to fill in a questionnaire, which occurred questions about their level of education, the relationship to violence and optimism, given their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Through Facebook, Bartlettovi and his colleagues have managed to get the results from more than 10,000 fans 14 different right - wing groups in 11 european countries - without ever having to leave office.</seg>
<seg id="12">“ This is a completely new way of doing research, ” notes Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results not so surprising: online supporters of the right - wing groups are mostly young men, which popuzuje rising levels of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But on the other hand, “ those who its online activism combined with off - line activism ” are more reasonable, more democratic, less violent than those who are constantly ukryti for screen computers. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The team 's work DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers are using these sites to learn everything from health problems after social trends hiding aktualizacemi Estates, contributions on walls and stisknutými tlačítky “ I like. ”</seg>
<seg id="17">Facebook has reported more than 800 million active users. each of them a day on average will provide three different figures, from which the social network does literally “ information supernovu ”, which stands for the development of many of the new research, and the number of academic work, in whose name is found the word on Facebook, have risen relative to what it was five years ago to almost 800%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some scientists is the charm of Facebook in that it gives them the opportunity to study people without being had to bother somewhere in the middle of the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">“ Before it was that if you wanted to carry out a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify. ”</seg>
<seg id="20">“ You would have to get into a party, where would you but never lose, ” says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">“ All of this Facebook eliminates - simply go directly to them. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others argue that the site will be able to offer a way to identify the socio - health problem and avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a recent study doktorky Megan Moreno from universities in Wisconsinu, the research team found that college students, who analysed its a drunken outcomes on Facebook, they were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Morenová proposes that peers students website monitoring and came up with the supply of student aid, which publishes too many opileckých status.</seg>
<seg id="25">“ The problem can be solved if it can diagnose, ” he told the Washington Post 's Dimitri Christakis, a co - author of doktorky Moreno and director of the Center for Health, behavior and development of children on the children' s Research Institute in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="26">“ We found a way to identify at - risk children, which would otherwise not have had the chance to discover. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why I Selwin, who spent long years of research on new technologies, thinks that the pencil and zápisník continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.</seg>
<seg id="39">“ When you go into the real world and talk with real people, this is something that cannot be replaced, ” he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">“ Social research should be on the companies and social activities, and a lot of the heck social activities are still happening offline. ”</seg>

<seg id="1">7 the lessons to be learned from the Lost interview with Stevem Jobsem in film mířícím into cinemas this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">When Steve jobs 5 October died, have started to appear the views of the people, who he compared with Henry Ford - and elect him as his biggest genialitu modern vynálezcem.</seg>
<seg id="3">The recently znovuobjeveném Jobsově interview, which was oprášen special for the film, which is in cinemas this week, it will be for all the fans of Apple 's iTunes, the fact that his creative minds perfectly well understood business processes and work behind the flows of its products.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a fantastic designérem, dream maker and a member of the self - proclaimed hippie movement, but at the same time also pedantským organizer and man that every little detail fits in detail - believed that many entrepreneurs are suffering from “ the notion that really is a great idea of 90 per cent of their work … [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a very long way so many work. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995 he worked Bob Cringely on tv, the agenda of the triumph of the computer 's, which was about the dawn of personal computers during the recording took place a unique, more than hour interview.</seg>
<seg id="6">By then it was already had 10 years from now, what jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with their new computer company, Next and eagerly vyhlížel, as the general public will accept the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">In tv, the agenda was eventually used a short part of the entire Cringelyho interview and on the original copies interview with tradovalo, that have been lost in transit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after the Jobsově penalty, however, were found in režisérově VHS copies of the garage.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is this material, slightly sestříhaný, forms the basis of 68minutového film Steve jobs lost: an interview, which is headed to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who was famous for her distaste for the provision of talks here longer, jobs are amazingly enthusiastically, that may be rozpovídat on its technological philosophy and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also proving to be a very thoughtful man.</seg>
<seg id="12">Four times during the interview, between the question and the answer will come a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds thinking, when it is to see how the jobs answer perfectly considers to have it as the most accurate and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when on the surface of sails Jobsův perfekcionismus when Cringelyho issues are eagerly and popohání him to quickly came to the more important problems and issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The interview was natočen before the era of Pixaru, an ipod or iPhonu and is frighteningly prescient example ideas, when jobs' s assessment of what others are doing well and the company 's badly, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to browse the posmrtná assessment Jobsovy careers, but on Jobsovi, which we see as dychtivého dreamer in the prime of his geniality, is something raw and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">Here is their own vision of how the matter could and should look like.</seg>
<seg id="17">Before long, and then, what their ideas, it is also started putting into practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is certainly worth noting:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">How I learned to be guided by the company:</seg>
<seg id="20">“ During the years of the business, I am always asked: “ why are you doing this? ” and the answer is always the same: well, that is how it simply doing. ”</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why does what he does, never on matters relating to the business thinks in depth.</seg>
<seg id="22">What I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs goes on to say that describes its effort to simplify accounting in Apple 's iTunes.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was absolutely confused by the way in which they have been recorded costs - often with the slogan “ standard ”, the cost of their $could only think. at the moment I decided to get their own way - developed automatic instrument, which guarantee, that could determine the cost of business in our heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">How did rošťárnu on Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs remembers the “ blue boxes ” that sestrojil with Stevem Wozniakem - equipment, which people can effectively to hack into the phone companies and free of charge to hold the anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">The equipment that was written in the past for many, but Jobsovo enthusiasm, when the blue boxes describes as a tool of power, is literally contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tells how with Wozniakem facility tested using paid phone and during the conversation has left přepojovat from one network AT &amp;amp; T to another, while the use of what the greatest number of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="29">“ We have not the least půltucetkrát propletli circles around the world, so when we then something zakřičeli into buying the phone, there are about a minute later a second phone call to the door, ” směje is jobs.</seg>
<seg id="30">“ We were young and we found ourselves that we can build thing, which is able to manage infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world. ”</seg>
<seg id="31">You two have been fabricated malinkou věcičku, which managed to control a much more giant - it was an incredible experience, and I think that without it, never emerged company Apple.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs continues with a description of a joke, which with Wozniakem almost through by the end of the blue box. through the middle of the night to call the Vatican and asked about whether he would be able to speak with the Pope, and what is best for issuing Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">Gradually drafted increasingly higher - ranking members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with the american diplomat, and only just before the phone to wake up and the Pope, the couple rozchechtala and handset asked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As zamiloval in technology (and on the phone with Bill Hewlettem):</seg>
<seg id="35">When he was 12 and sháněl spare parts, so that they could stand kmitoměr, found in the telephone number on the list of Bill Hewletta and called him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Not long after their 20minutovém interview for jobs assured the summer brigádu in the company of Hewlett - Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">“ Incredibly influenced me. that was the only company that I am in the time I have known, and in my view on this, what kind of society is and how to treat their employees. ”</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the employees of HP, who visited the corporate research labs in PALO ALTO, which saw the first “ desktop computer, that has ever been made. ”</seg>
<seg id="39">It was great as the kufr, had the CRT Monitor and I look to him immediately zamiloval.</seg>
<seg id="40">In my teens, I am in HP moved higher and higher, poflakoval I around the computer and started for him to write programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Both are inventing innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">In a few places jobs during the conversation is about how are inventing new products for a hand.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a couple of circuit boards, a customer asked for it has compiled together the entire computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Available should only pay 30 days, during which he had to invent, smontovat and add a ready - made equipment.</seg>
<seg id="45">When he was later in Apple 's iTunes, remembers the problems they face in the development of computer mice:</seg>
<seg id="46">“ I remember how we have quite a wildly squabbled … shouted at me, it would take five years [a mouse, which would cost $300], to me it has stopped talking, I came out and took the designéra. ”</seg>
<seg id="47">About 90 days later we were able to produce perfectly reliable mouse for $15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">How big companies to be running out of steam:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before he led the resurrection of Apple 's jobs, presciently predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision zakolísá and lose their share of the market.</seg>
<seg id="50">“ Let 's say that you are working with the companies or IBM xerox, so do better kopírky or printers, so what next? ”</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly on the market, so the company is no longer a company can be more successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">In that moment, no longer dominates the sales and marketing, so companies šéfují people, who are in charge of this, while people who in charge of their own products are played off against from the decision - making process.</seg>
<seg id="53">Technological genius, which brought the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad products - zručnost and technical expertise are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">This is exactly what happened in society xerox …</seg>
<seg id="55">The company xerox could own a literally the computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It could be ten times more than it is, could be Microsoft 1990s …</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead of victory, however, has created a defeat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">As it takes innovation as a form of art:</seg>
<seg id="59">“ Between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a long way to go and a lot of work … and how he is making a great idea, and is also changing and growing. ”</seg>
<seg id="60">During that time, about a lot of it teach.</seg>
<seg id="61">You have to agree to a series of compromises - certain things simply elektrony, glass, robots or factories do not force.</seg>
<seg id="62">You have to bear in mind constantly 5 000 things - different concepts - and called them together …</seg>
<seg id="63">At the end of the day, depending on taste - trying to think of the best things that ever what created the humanity, and, in a way, is trying to translate into what they are doing.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">I have never nestyděl for this, that I am the best ideas uloupil.</seg>
<seg id="66">The company Macintosh was so great and successful, therefore, that the people who work in it, were excellent, artists, musicians, básnící zoologové, historians and, coincidentally, also the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">Had it not been for computers and new technologies, we can be wonderful things in a totally different sectors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas večeřeli with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case to be addressed the court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On a day when the Supreme Court picked behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial, the question of whether to take the objection to President Obama 's health care law, two of the judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attending a gala dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be before the court is part of the negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident last Thursday, when all nine justices met to discuss the submitted proposals.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases were brought probíraných lawsuit filed by 26 states, questioning the radical overhaul of health care, Congress approved last year by - law, which mobilized the conservative activists around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed that the lawsuit heard in March, however, expects 5,5hodinové negotiations, with the result that is even more — unsettling presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at a time of a decision will be in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A lawyer, who will stand up in front of the Court and will try to achieve the rejection of the law, will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under the George W. Bush administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clementova law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which is already a long summer deals with the advocacy of a conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another company, which sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations to question the law, called the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another was a sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which are in the process of stake in huge financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held in Washington hotel a few hours after the debate on the subject of the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">He attended her, among others, also Mitch McConnell, the republican leader in the Senate, and confirmed the opponents of the law on health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">And the marketing of guests? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is nothing new: the two judges the actions of the Federalist Society in for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And certainly it is not for nothing that would be in contravention of the rules of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, these judges are exempt from the requirement to observe the behavior, which are subject to lower the federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If not, however, would certainly their behavior were under the principle of C4, who says that “ the judge can participate in events, which are related and other organisations, in order to raise funds, but the judges must not be speaker, the guest of honor, must not be given on the agenda of the action. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two legal firms účinkujícím in the case, and also the company with huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to zalarmoval activists calling for ethics in government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“ This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of some judges that the Supreme Court has behaved according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges, ” said Bob Edgar, the president of the organization Common cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">“ The judges eating meat and večeřeli on social benefici together with the legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss his case before the court. ”</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence, and helping to raise funds through this action undermines the feet of any claims of biased, which is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas against its critics have shown little understanding and tell them that they also have no problem combine their legal obligations with action groups, such as the Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thomasova wife, Ginni is highly senior conservative campaigner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Moreover, conservatives have argued that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kaganová not with Thomas and Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kaganová worked as the prosecutor for the government of President Obama, when he first appeared before a court challenge to the law.</seg>
<seg id="25">Critics kaganové on it is pushing to have renounced participation in the case, and argue that the time for the law has struggled so much, than that may now be disinterested.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kaganová not signalled that it was preparing to step down.</seg>

<seg id="16">This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the rise in fuel prices - majority that is harmful to the airlines, because it is about one of its biggest cost - is not as decisive, because the country itself on higher oil prices earns.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is important, because for them it is just as likely as other airline that might revoking or postpone the dictates of the aircraft because of an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The warning from the Pentagon about the potential cuts in defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress not properly under Pot, when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget, they could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction of start - ups in the Pentagon and the continued across the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembling linkám.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon will have to already spend a budget cut of about $450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears reduction for an additional $600 billion, if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire portfolio, ” Panetta wrote in a letter to the senátorům John McCain, of Arizona, and 's Lindsey Grahamové, South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that Congress' s inability to reach a consensus on the budget and, by extension, the so - called attachment to 23% across - the - board decline and stop many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">“ Because of this enormous reduction, used an unwise this way, it will not be possible to implement most of our construction projects or ship - you cannot buy only three - quarters of a building or boats. in addition, there may be a serious damage to other modernization efforts, ” Panetta wrote senátorům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">“ We will also be forced to retrieve it, many of our civilian employees, and because it has a reduction in place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly civilians to send on furlough, in order to be able to meet the requirements. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">“ These changes may shake the faith of those who are in charge of our army and seriously damage its readiness. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the end of the day, with the cuts affect and combat troops, said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">“ Although the accounts for the funding of possible war operations overseas this obstávka directly affected, the operation will be affected by serious changes in other budgets, ” warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">“ There will be a cut in the contract personnel, which will result in delays domluvených contracts supporting the war effort of our people. ”</seg>
<seg id="12">“ The cut will be the paid staff, all of which will come too late payments to suppliers and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Both senators Panettovi ten days ago, erased and asked him about the details of the possible effects on the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“ The consequences of obstávky at the Ministry of Defense, could lead to a rapid deterioration in the point of view of the United States as the world 's military superpower. ”</seg>
<seg id="15">“ We are strictly against this brutal measures, ” the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when Panettův published a letter.</seg>
<seg id="16">“ This is not the conclusion that we have been able to live, and we certainly do not want to sign him under. ”</seg>
<seg id="17">“ The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which should not be allowed to happen. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“ It remains to be seen whether Panettův letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress authorizing the budget and will amplify voices calling on the Pentagon 's omission from the list of seškrtaných areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta was recently in talks about a possible cuts ever more open, although he switched to its high position in the Pentagon with years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so I knew that going into a tough fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference held by minutý week defense minister has indicated a brief description of what his department can wait - shell of the army, within which, however, will miss the core.</seg>
<seg id="21">“ It will be like a ship without them. ”</seg>
<seg id="22">“ It will be as a brigade without ammunition. ”</seg>
<seg id="23">“ It will be like the air force without a well - trained pilots. ”</seg>
<seg id="24">“ It will be like a paper tiger, as an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough - grown soldiers, who would be able to complete the mission, ” Panetta said at the start of a speech at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">“ It will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a potential enemy. ”</seg>
<seg id="26">“ As a result, we will welcome the aggression … ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the annex supplied with McCain 's letter and Grahamové Panetta specifies how will be reducing resulted in “ significant operational risks: late response to the crisis, wars and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibility of operations and deployments around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in the future of combat operations. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition, Panetta added that some of the greatest defense projects would have to wait for the end, including those that are already being tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the list, for example, a project of the plane F35, the planned new bombardéru, ballistic submarines, a new generation of new littoral combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, which like the Army and Marine infantry replace humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Halting the further development and testing the plane F35 over the next ten years, save $80 billion, but his supporters say that it is a necessary next step in the fine - tuning of the army, which is the need for countries to deal with the possible threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This is a demonstration of a transcript of the interview, which you can find in the pages of La Nación on the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For your kostarické supporters is the realisation of a dream. Pearl pits will play in Costa Rica. do you realise, what are your fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The journey to Costa Rica is our dream, which is becoming a reality.</seg>
<seg id="11">In South and Central America, we barely a second time and experience to date have been great.</seg>
<seg id="12">I went to Costa Rica only once, on leave. this is a wonderful country, and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days.</seg>
<seg id="13">So we have a great joy, that you can bring our music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask, because this group of literally zbožňují, fans are in these days of preparation is very hard.</seg>
<seg id="15">What do you say their nejskalnějším supporters?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you, that you have stood with us so long for a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="17">It took us almost 21 years before we get to Costa Rica. thank you, that you have been waiting for so long, and we regret that it took us for so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people talk about koncertu already as the greatest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">This raises in you more pressure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the biggest show, which we have for the last 21 years, came out in a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have some excellent Show in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get to a concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">In truth, the concert power forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">Love this country, like serfujeme, like the jungle. for both the activities of Costa Rica is the best country in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">As you get to know of Costa Rica and its waves due to surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have a lot of friends netizens and I have a good friend who lived in Tamarindo. the waves are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends from travel to Costa Rica or in Nicaragua, or to Mexico, and those are the best places to surfing, and so we have to Costa Rica, we were told by people who love surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">If you look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many písněmi.</seg>
<seg id="28">What have you planned on their presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Given that there are never play, there are no restrictions on what we could do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We are going to try to demonstrate what the best show with a variety of skladbami. will try to play a couple of songs from each of the ALBA and imagine our fans good and varied repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never neopakujete repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think that this is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves other compositions, therefore it is difficult to choose what songs will play every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we are in the repertoire, two of the three songs, which we played for a long time, we are concentrating on them and also made a surprise, because we remember that, why are we so liked and that we have on this may have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">So it is for us to show more interesting, and therefore I think that is interesting and for the people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This tour celebrate 20 years the artistic career.</seg>
<seg id="37">When you look back, it is hard to believe everything you could?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, it certainly.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I think, that none of us could imagine, that we will be in one big rock group and that it will remain in more than 20 years. it sounds like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We are aware of how much we were given and it moves us, that we can continue to play together.</seg>
<seg id="41">Do we have to be happy, and they like to make music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted.</seg>
<seg id="43">We could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What you mean that you were an important part of the grunge žánru?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Always for us it was an honour that we can be part of this group, in which is represented by the same velikáni.</seg>
<seg id="46">People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is hardly surprising, when there is a movement of a group of friends, very often it does not happen.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common, so that from one city suddenly came out five to 10 groups.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud of that and we are proud to be part of the group that we can from Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes, with some even playing.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains, and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden on tours. we are fortunate that they are all our friends and is an honour, that we can be a part of this movement that began in Seattle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also a very unusual for the group as you keep together, and even after those years are still the same members.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, we have four together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) join us 13 years ago, which, in itself, is a much longer than is usual duration of the group.</seg>
<seg id="54">I think, first of all, that we have all been fortunate that we are still in this world and, secondly, a role played by the fact that they are constantly concerned about one another.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all close friends and, thanks to this, we managed to open the musical journey, which let everyone enough freedom to his own experimentation.</seg>
<seg id="56">Each other, we believe, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think that it could be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship to the word celebration was not easy. however, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.</seg>
<seg id="58">How are the balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">How we rostli, has gradually been increasingly easier to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are trying to nejezdit too on the circuit, because it is very easy to fall into this trap crowds and the people who love our music.</seg>
<seg id="61">When you consider that people have come because of the music, that you have to confront the music and what you give it, you must not get carried away with respect. that you famous, rock stars. that neither of us never really was interested not in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">As you remember another project Mother love bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think that we were writing great songs, and at the beginning of this was something grand.</seg>
<seg id="64">As a band we were three years and we never get any album until after umřel Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">It was very frustrating because it took so long., the most important thing is that it is now přátelíme with Bruce (Fairweather) and Gregem (Gilmore), who started in kapele with us; when we listen to a song or looking at the pictures, I remember how Andy was incredible, as I have with him nasmál. always a pleasure working with him, laughing, talking with a bang or a football and many others.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an incredible person and power is missing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">National band Las Robertas will be charged with that, in Costa Rica began the show.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you do it is chosen as předskokany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production has sent videos with several proposals and this group we liked the most, which is why we are wondering what Las Robertas offering face to face and must be very funny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why always on changing the words Yellow Ledbetter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">He singing and I think that adds up to the first of what it invades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Who you like basistu influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">A lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="75">As the first spring to mind Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski …</seg>
<seg id="76">There 's so much that I could throughout the evening talking about basistech, who I like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has managed to keep the pits Pearl grunge, although they are not in vogue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think that we all felt always slightly separation from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When we think of grunge, presenting the group, to which I have mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all the others that have emerged in the same period, and if it is, even now, this music in place, so it is something of a beautiful, because this is the music, which is worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney today play better muziku than ever before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the beginning of the should your music easily bleak nature and now is more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">What is behind this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This is interesting because I feel that in the new album is a couple of songs, which are lighter - style, but also there are songs as the leading or Juste Breathe, which are considered very glum, although may be as positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">In either of the two, when me is Ed, so I cried, and these are the songs of the deeply dark.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think that when vyrůstáš and you have in the life of any trauma, ztratíš someone from the family or friends, these things start to influence your art and music, and these two songs for me, this is what they represent.</seg>
<seg id="85">I also think that you can be a happy man, and yet we do pochmurnou muziku.</seg>

<seg id="1">Park or the mountains?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Architects have gathered on the occasion of vypsání management, which involves more than about the controversy</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Urban tender for 16 gates again opens the debate about the role of the park Collserola in Barcelona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid - 1980s, at the time the largest heyday of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the Authority vytiskla several pamfletů in support of the park Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">Letáček defined the mountain as a great park Metropolitan Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">What is more, was accompanied by the comparison with newyorským by Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, in 1987, the CMB, Park to come back into the thinking of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. the Catalan capital is one of the few that do not focus on the axis of the north - south, but up (Montenegro) - down (Sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">Qualifications Collseroly as natural park was moving in that direction.</seg>
<seg id="9">References already was in Central Park, but with Yellowstone divočáky instead of Yogi Bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">That was the position until September, when the city declared a mega competition consisting of 16 konkurzy on the same number of entry points into Collseroly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Of course, the idea of recording taken rather Park.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or someone trying to locate a gateway to the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">But there is only one question: Collserola, Park or the mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisation on the basis of reflection on the town, the issue becomes a central theme of all the Barcelona architects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is already the subject of just otřelé, as when two members of the old caste selected at the meeting in the lift shake hands.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it is this feat has caused one of the rare matches between what they think three barcelonští architects and předstoupivší university professors.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: selection process makes sense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to Roldána after načala question of the Gulf, “ should ” discussed on “ the side of the mountain ”, so the speech Ildefonse Cerda on green apples has run its course.</seg>
<seg id="19">“ We must be based on the principle that the Barcelona nejrozlehlejším Park is a beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, its great availability.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, ” said architect, for whom the title of “ the gates into the Collserola ” in the “ lexikologickou trap ”: we must not be a “ as input into the park, but rather as a definition of the zones, where it is possible to act. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experience of the world urbanismu qualifies as an “ intellectual challenge ” skýtající “ some danger. ”</seg>
<seg id="23">The dangers involved in “ uncertainty, which today is a project of public places ” after the experience of the 1980s, which should be in the area of the forum “ its Swan voice. ”</seg>
<seg id="24">The first concern is the very definition of the border, where should build.</seg>
<seg id="25">“ Something to define the means to do another step, ” that is, in principle, to move a step further.</seg>
<seg id="26">“ We need to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current (referring to the general Metropolitan plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster ”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">If we focus on the issue in more detail, Modol believes that a slope údolní Collserola can be considered a “ park, ” but not part of the Barcelona, for reasons of purely topographical.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol also reminded that there is already a work by the Patronat de Collserola, which “ must not end up in the dustbin ”, although welcomes the fact that the city offers his grémiu, that the project will hit from the “ first time ”.</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition, and they understand that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a kind of propustkou, which allows architects to engage in the debate, but “ doubt ” that it should be precisely this technical profile, which will be led by a multidisciplinary teams (“ this is all about the skills, ” adds), which is necessary to create: “ the architects should be the only tools. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, which has given the title of this game, it is difficult, because in the material for the selection process is missing a global vision Collserola: “ has been declared a 16 tenders, which deal with all the axis of the mountain - Sea, but there is no podélná study, which would have on the field looked and saw it as a whole. ”</seg>
<seg id="31">It gives the impression that he at least, up to all 16 tenders.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the project one gates can turn to the concept and the definition of the architect of the neighbouring gates.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his view, the city should ensure that the band was located immediately above ronda de Dalt should ensure in the length of a zone equipment, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Mexico 's Institute of health insurance (IMSS) announced that leads research in order to identify the gene for obesity among children and young. research entitled “ the genetics of obesity among children and adolescents ” to get the results of the overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the report, the leading research medical units in the biochemistry of specialist hospitals National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, he explained, that was set up a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, experts on nutrition and social workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the centre of the research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) National polytechnického Institute (IPN.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To participate in the research can also the general public, or nemající authorisation. people can come into participating in sports centres IMSS in Valle de Mexico City, where it will be every soboru from 8 hours to conduct stress tests by young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">To emphasise that the research began in the sports centre Cuauhtémoc (the mexican state) and from 8 October, this activity is also in the sports center Nezahualcóyolt (east of Mexico 's state).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As soon as they obtained data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the sports center Independencia (south of the Federal) and eventually in the sports centre Morelos (north of Federal Center).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the ingredients and the importance of genetics, in terms of the development of obesity, and traced in Mexico 's children and young people risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, which is celebrating its 14 November, reminded us that the aim is to collect data from three of thousands of children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent of the and under the supervision of the parents, for the use of specific questionnaire about nutrition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The questionnaire will also ask for physical activity, and the family 's track record hereditary disease in order to avoid risk factors, which could cause diseases such as diabetes or ledvinová inadequacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Sure, that every Saturday with all the participants are antropometrická measurement (weight, height, waist size), measured by the blood pressure, is determined by the level of glucose, cholesterol, inzulínu trigliceridů, and studying the genes (trying to identify genes that are involved in the creation of the child obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects concern over an alarming increase in health workers, the children 's weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“ Health exit polls carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there has been only for boys to the rise in obesity about 77% and for girls to 47%. a dramatic increase in also occurred in the case of overweight, ” said expert from IMSS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">He said that one of the reasons for seeking indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from the others of their genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Informed that the average Mexičan has a 65% indiánsko - american genetic predispositions, 30% of the European and 5% of African. this is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is routinely explains as failure to burn excess energy they consume (calories) and which carries in the form of fat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Researcher explained that the direct benefit participants lies in the fact that they will receive the overall assessment of the state of the children, which will see whether they show any known overweight or obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">He said that even the presence of vrásek dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and předloktí indicates the likelihood that a person will suffer metabolickými problems and předcukrovkovými positions.</seg>

<seg id="20">The information is confidential, doctors it in writing to parents and to explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must carry out to their children avoid disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main ingredients that are causing the overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary life involving the lack of daily physical activity a day vysedávání in front of the television and the use of vehicles instead of walking on a short distance away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Overweight also causes great kalorický income, which is the greater consumption of slazených drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgry, etc.) high in fats and proteins, and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the asphalt from UNAM there will be bumps</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrero, a scientist from the department of chemical UNAM creates a modified asfalty with polymery and creating a mixture of drawing better functionality, independently on climatic conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If it is rightly fostering dláždění, it would need to be repaired almost 200,000 výmolů after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valle de Mexico City, to draw Rafael Nájera Herrero, a scientist from the chemical School (FQ) from UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt dláždění was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of výmolů, or even may be completely removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In its přednášce technological cause výmolů, made in the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership is modified asfalty with polymery, thereby should rise to mix with similar characteristics like asphalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resilience, and both at the low, so at high temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrero Nájera believes that this kind of modified asfaltů could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some towns in the north of the country improve. so the functionality and reduce the creation of výmolů.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt, the most difficult part of the oil, is a grouping of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with great molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and others with low molecular weight, which are called malteny. together add asphalt typical viskoelastický character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Viskoelastický nature of asphalt lies in the fact that, for high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acting as a discharge, in 120 - degree has high viskozitu and in 50 degrees is almost in solid shape, while at low temperatures of asphalt has tended to lámat, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but it changes during the day, according to weather conditions and temperature, draw expert in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Scientist from the department of chemical observed that most streets in Ciudad de Mexico City is covered by flexible dlažbou, which is made up of six layers of materials, three of which are the latest mixed with asfaltem.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between nejsvrchnějšími classes are asfaltová vložka, consisting of a small add zalitými in the asphalt and then stlačenými.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To emphasise that every block, which is made up of vložku is zalit asfaltem.</seg>
<seg id="12">In transit cars or in the creation of the pressure it is possible to force in the ditch well spread.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it were a modified asphalt, spread would be even better, believes the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Add that to the asphalt vložku are the last class called the mantle, consisting of a fine stones, so the sand also zalitým in the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given that this class will come into contact with ráfky vehicles must be more mechanical power than asfaltová vložka and must ensure the friction of roadway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Given the fact that, as a part of dláždění will be exposed to the great burden must have the mantle of sufficient width and must be careful not to material from which is zhotoven.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factor, which is important to bear in mind, especially water is having a major impact on functionality asfaltové vložky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Once the terrain vlhký, water is spreading inside and it is difficult to get it out, it causes a softening of all classes dlažby and the emergence of výmolů.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">He explained that during the creation of výmolů as the first film will eat away at pláště, and then there is damage to asfaltové vložky. to damage but does not occur in one moment, but this is a gradual process, which should stop at the first signs of through appropriate programmes maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a member of a national system of scientists also explained that the burden of the vehicle is another important factor in creating výmolů, and therefore tloušťka each layer dlažby must comply with the burden of vehicles and must ensure that this burden on the cross. is the only way we can avoid many of výmolů.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrero pointed out that when it comes to the asphalt, yet we have a lot of work and research is at the beginning of a. is worth noting, for example, asfaltové emulze, which are in other countries are already available on the market and allow easily repaired bumps without having to use high temperatures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury chose to name it only the first vícemiss, is the fact that convinced his answer to the question: “ which book you enjoyed the most and why? ” asked by MURILLO Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The answer is not happy about the term “ culturize ” and, therefore, that she explained what the latter books marked.</seg>

<seg id="15">And you people, read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. ”</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the front - runner position.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bogotský journalist suggested that this, that she has been since the beginning of the most popular, nejoslavovanější and one that I learnt all previous prices (gastronomická challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dresses and the Queen Mother), raising the envy of other uchazeček, vystresovalo queen, which then on the stage has failed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This was evident in the first presentation plavek on the beach Hiltonu and during two parades before final crown.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although on both zářila, was to know that it lacked the strength and vitality, which showed reprezentantky from Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, journalist programme “ at home ” on Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first vícemiss confirms the fact that List, which during the competition will get the most titles at the end of the day, with neodchází korunkou Queen ”.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle in recent days has held the rather nevlídný attitude to the media and that it will pay for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince porotu on its interest in social work, which are the basis for national beauty contests.</seg>
<seg id="23">As an aside, two days before the choice of the international jury member of Luca Doughty said that they are looking for a woman who will be aware of social needs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">“ In the competition Miss Colombia beauty in itself is not enough, we need to see something more than just physical beauty. we need to focus on social conscience and it is important to list before entering the competition, to be involved in such projects, ” explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Also, there is speculation that the candidate Valle has lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibróze, which was on the abdomen materialising. but this is completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, which it has chosen Miss “ natural beauty ” for the healthiest body, a healthy diet and responsible physical activity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing for the Queen, acknowledges that Melina had the best body, that there were better girls, “ but the problems with the fibrosis in the abdomen, which in my opinion is not too noticeable, her ubraly points until the last day. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos from magazine Cromos believes that myself from Valle made a mistake when he took a couple of surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="28">“ Surgical interventions are in order, but in the Valle they go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her body has never been a strong side here and chose its toll. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this award, which, for the first time, the National Assembly udělovalo beauty, after the parade in her was a cruel forecasts, which are realized. it was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melině allowed that it might eventually give the highest crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina today 's day started year of their softness, not as the Queen, but as a princess, from a position, which gives it the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the national competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, will go down in history as one of the queens, which despite strhujícímu success in Cartageně is the highest korunce received.</seg>

<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career González worked at a town hall in Chocó, where he has had often even more than five days web jungle, to get to the place where they were walking, that there was a need to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000, the přemístil into the capital of the Valle and after he graduated from the courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. this science deals with studying friction skin, so their hands the hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="16">It does not mislead the eye: it was a “ Alfonso Cano. ”</seg>

<seg id="20">A lot of people don 't know our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">Daktyloskopie is not an exact science, without the possibility of mistakes that can play a key role in the decision - making process of crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In addition to identifying corpses to help these people in research crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identities of people caught.</seg>
<seg id="23">If they are caught, a lot of offenders presenting false papers or have Securities at all.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Investigator told that in case of injury, had to be in the house to remove a piece of a wall of the house, because at this point, the thief relied for his trezor full of jewellery and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The walls are difficult, because they are not intended for fingerprints, but in this case we could get stamp on the eye, and to identify the perpetrators, who was involved in several krádežích ”, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder.</seg>
<seg id="28">Not long ago, found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the basis of the investigation has found that could be responsible for the murder of one of the family members and the stamp on láhvi it really has confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although it could not be 100%, to confirm that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime.</seg>

<seg id="31">An expert on the fingerprints of the honor, explained that the objects with prints of “ blurred through chemical or physical reactive materials. ”</seg>
<seg id="32">When there is, and has been for their collection uses transplantátor or the tape.</seg>
<seg id="33">Stamps are then shipped to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or on registraturu.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">GDP is growing about 1.5% thanks to the household consumption and the end of a period of crashes, which began in March</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Since March last year, Japan 's economy was paralysed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake, which had turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster, which has had to face since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first estimates tokyjské governments have quantified material loss of 300 000 million dollars, blow, which, despite the difficult global situation well healing.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three quarters of the value of GDP between July and September, got into such a position, that it was possible to finally turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and a 6% a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The results of the second quarter - to Japanese tax year starting in March 2012, moreover, assume the greatest growth rate in comparison with the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery is partly explained by purchasing machines, which are necessary for the reconstruction of areas devastated the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the January - March. this is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.</seg>

<seg id="9">However, the real wake - up call in the japanese economy is based solely on momentum, which forces taking advantage of the crisis to emerge from it much strengthening, or to rebuild infrastructure. is about to take advantage of the lack of it, is to start from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan is awoke. in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan 's GDP.</seg>

<seg id="14">The stronger currency are products more expensive abroad, which is a negative for the country, whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, the Toyota or Sony přičítaly their weak results in July when in September just rate Yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While the markets continue to obléhají peripheral EU countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda is being cautious.</seg>
<seg id="17">“ We need to be careful about the risks that remain, as is the destruction of some overseas economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in Yen, ” said yesterday, the state secretary for economic policy Motohisa Furukawa.</seg>

<seg id="1">The CDU is proposing to elect the president on the basis of universal suffrage</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).</seg>
<seg id="3">The issue of Europe 's future on the programme was not initially, but it became her up in the autumn, in particular, to be satisfying for party members, who see the policy of the government today to the Greeks and maybe tomorrow against the Italians for lax.</seg>
<seg id="4">A proposal for the president of the European Commission, given the leadership has been accepted almost in unison.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only nine of the number of 1001, delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few minutes standing ovation from vstoje at the conclusion of the speech of Angela Merkel and, eventually, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro - european finance minister, left no room for doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: “ the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe means peace, but because “ the nine million jobs depend directly on the euro. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">According to the Chancellor in Europe, “ the time has come to change. ”</seg>
<seg id="10">This could give the changes in the Lisbon Treaty for control of the European Union over budgetary policies of member countries of the euro zone, but it could also result in the election of the president of the European Commission, on the basis of universal suffrage, “ in order to give Europe a face. ”</seg>
<seg id="11">This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which is clearly inspirátorem Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is certainly a little unlikely that all 27 countries in this revolutionary move quickly agree: is opposed the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU thinks that the same position will also Nicolas Sarkozy.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the direction is vytýčen.</seg>
<seg id="14">As well as delegates rejected by a large majority of the proposal to appreciate the weight of each country in the board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in a boost to the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Driven by concern to reassure the climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. attempted to obtain Congress but talk of the “ small ” european states or the countries that are in trouble, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.</seg>

<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux and visiting the office for the provision of social support, where prosloví speech on the subject of recurring since 2007 on the fight against fraud and redistribution of social solidarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">As escorts for the offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but it is no less clear from the point of view of the right - wing of the presidential campaign, with most of the right - wing wants to concentrate on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, because of budgetary savings the government intends to impose on the staff of the private sector 's fourth day sick before they begin to take in support of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To be clear, without the consent of the enterprise, the employee who is ill, he lost four days of wages, so at least 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">The measures, which risks to cause a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos could bring about 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">And also the measures, which would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic impact: to give public employees one day nehrazené sick (so far have no failure over three days in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these issues are the subject of discussion, the majority of the right launches also focused on the theme of fraud this time abuses tied with the labor neschopnostmi.</seg>
<seg id="10">“ The controls will be much larger and more: if you get, you will come back, ” pointed out Xavier Bertrand in granting an interview station RTL on Sunday 13 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seemed somewhat disproportionate to the truth about nepravostech in job neschopnostech.</seg>
<seg id="12">These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political pressures, which bear fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are more sick than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The first stop on a couple of official figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to nationale Caisse d 'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance companies) was in 2006 paid out more than 237 million euro the daily allowance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute for Research and documentation in the health sector accounted for in 2008, the per diem with its 11.3 billion euros of 5% of spending on health care.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, 46% concerned parent contributions and work - related accidents and 54% on working in default, i. e. 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">So the only 2.5% of the cost of health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">According to a study of the Alma Consulting should the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="20">The average, which holds some variation: another anketa R. published in 2007 in the pages of the Jobs behemoths. com showed that 75% of those surveyed 40,000 french employees said they have no nevybralo day of disability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time by institutions sickness insurance, makes it clear that in R. 2010 37,8% of defaults was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 in three months and 11% took longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When compared with its european neighbours, french workers are more prone than elsewhere to work neschopnostem.</seg>
<seg id="23">One long study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence of (for health reasons or not) in France has alternated between 10% and 11.8% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Cheating in job neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the relative to work on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="25">When it comes to fraud, these are just a small - scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of the legislation from R. 2002 ensured that there are systematic controls aimed at working the inability of more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, CNAM noted that when 1.5 million checks was 13.8% of 285,000 carried out because of the short - term neschopnostem “ unwarranted or too long ”, i. e. 37 050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of systemically - controlled the inability of more than 45 days, with napočítalo 11% of cases “ adapted or unjustified ” at 1.2 million checks, i. e. 132 000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">A total of 169 so 000 “ unjustified ” cases on several million workers who have been sick.</seg>
<seg id="30">The figure, which is much less than the number of its work on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to members of the UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent a 9 to 15 billion euro missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i. e. more than the total amount of the daily allowance and the infinitely more than fraud related to the aforementioned.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the matter of palliative care Commission urgently needs to governments, institutions caring about health and doctors worked together with the aim of ensuring the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The canadian company 's idea of denial of death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of Canadians really accepts the opportunity to talk with the doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and accepts the decision in this sense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of the report 's extensive royal canadian companies, which have helped six experts working in different areas, among whom was ethics, law and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Commission recommends the government changed the criminal law to dovolovalo assisted suicide and euthanasia, seems to be if this choice as needed on a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">At the beginning of the experts cited the recent polled independent agencies Economist Intelligence Unit, which compares the quality of the death penalty in 40 countries on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="9">While Canada is placed at the 10th spot, the study notes that “ medikalizace death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medikalizace yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the royal canadian companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the wish to die at home, which has a majority of Canadians 68,6% of them die in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average pay for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Québec, this figure is the highest with 86% of people dead in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">When it comes to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report, arrive at conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">According to experts, who also scrutinised all countries, where these approaches are legalised or are not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that this odkriminalizování causes any abuse in the app, i. e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides in person or nepříslušné nesouhlasící.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, P. Jocelyn Downie, co - author of the report, confirmed yesterday when teleconferencing more than many cases these mistakes that in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“ Euthanasia is carried out, and in Canada, where it is clearly illegal. ”</seg>
<seg id="17">“ Assisted suicide is being carried out and in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, ” explains Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadians are in favour of euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let us remember that, according to the investigation conducted by Angus Reid Forum in 2010 with 85% of Canadians have already have in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that will allow people to the end of her life to alleviate their suffering.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia does not mean that we are sending a message that the life of the elderly or disabled has a lower price.</seg>
<seg id="21">When it comes to those who follow the assisted suicide, 41% of those polled people believe that the court should not be prosecuted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the matter of maintaining or interruption of the care of the patient 's situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also on the list of their recommendations are proposing, that was in criminal law, said that the resignation from the treatment, for which there is a legally sanctioned by the refusal is not a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Commission experts also requires that by specialist physicians were educated obligation to respect the treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the matter of palliative care Commission urgently needs to governments, institutions caring about health and doctors worked together with the aim of ensuring the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the end of the day on the final paliativního or defuse already widely used in the canadian medical equipment, the Commission wants to be seen at a time when no longer serves to the reduction of physical pain, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other experts reservations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts on medical law already have expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report experts royal canadian companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Mr Pierre Deschamps, specialist in medical law, described as experts - signatories of the report as “ extreme ” among other things, therefore, that does not restrict the practice of euthanasia in sick in the final stage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">“ This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and that should be more than 18 years, could ask for it to be helped to commit suicide, ” says Pierre Deschamps, who yesterday résumé to study the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ms. Deschamps also underscores that it looks as if the authors of the report, built the autonomy of the people above all other values that are shaping the social fabric of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Because “ in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialistka medicínského rights Margaret Somerville also expressed “ strong objections to the report 's conclusions, which kvalifikovala ” as a manifesto for euthanasia. ”</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal canadian companies, in particular, is skeptical about the dates of the report concerning the absence of failures in some countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i. e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="4">Disponibilita and the price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and business competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is natural for a meeting in the election was an opportunity to think about such deposits and on the ground, which takes a power from nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will be successful only if we explore all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must establish its position on the objective facts and rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">So far, it is on the planet 7 billion human beings, but demographics, causing odteďka by 2050 to duplicate the demand for electricity, if we do not want a large chunk of the world 's population to get rid of an important part of life.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, we will need to face a shortage of fossil sources, in order to be able to continue to produce electricity, and cannot be, forget the necessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the fight against climate change, which is something, which at the moment are disappearing from the environmental debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">An accident involving in Fukushima have no influence on any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">And that is why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="12">But this is not the case in Belgium, which are subordinate to their decisions need to find some other source of capable of replacing oneself or Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the latest generation of power stations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote, at least some of the country 's continuing with the determination of their projects.</seg>

<seg id="15">If the german model based on renewable energy sometimes presented as an example, the reality is at odds with this.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin appear zdražením electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas importovaném especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions in the wake of the construction of the plants to natural gas and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of these unpleasant effects will be felt in a few months.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark deserves to be given to him pause.</seg>
<seg id="19">European champion in the wind, of which accounts for 30% of its electricity, is also one of the world 's largest consumer of coal and gas because of the disturbances of the wind, which are the CO2 emissions and danish higher electricity prices by 65%, or 50%, than the european average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the stable of our energy policy will pay our neighbours electricity bill by 40% higher than the payment of french households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry on the national territory, the french companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is for this reason that any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would give rise to a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make a beautiful illusory statements about re - industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The price that the vast majority of the french refuses to pay, as well as it does not fundamentally against this energy, as polls show.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The development of equipment - producing low co2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment using renewable energy sources by french industrial group AREVA testifies to achieve better complementarity sources of energy.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts rigorous and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new plants in Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, whose vocation is recognised, have the idea of security in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="33">For 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accident.</seg>

<seg id="35">In Chernobyl drama created the concept of the reactor and unjustifiable human error.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forgetting that the accident was the result of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will take the lesson to be learned from this accident as well as it did in the two previous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The fruit of the move and cooperation between the french and german authorities on nuclear safety, operators and designers is that type of EPR reactor is a concept that is able to withstand such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While all of the candidates who want to build a nuclear power plant, it attached to stop its construction in Flamanville, it would be a wonderful gift nabídnutým competitors of the AREVA and company EDF and the release of the way for it to seize the lead in the nuclear development.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is for the economy of the immigration burden or a chance?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the area of immigration policy pursued for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles, an oversupply of the police, courts and subjected to administration policy numbers, the compatibility of this policy to the status of “ the country of human rights ”, which boasts of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently it was the administrative harassment, which have been the subject of foreign students, which has become an up - to - date, when Interior Minister (see newspaper Libération on 23 May) said that France “ does not need foreign talent, zedníky and servírky. ”</seg>
<seg id="4">But so far, the only rarely rozebírána under the angle of the economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It has to be said, that in this area is fairly broad agreement between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">The right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac by saying that “ 900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million workers immigrants ” and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990, said that France “ cannot take all the misery in the world ”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, the fear of invasion hordes polish plumbers on french territory shared on both the right and the left.</seg>
<seg id="9">In both camps are immigrants to be seen as a burden for the economy and a french company.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the state of grace, who deign to immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme is François Hollande is limited to banalities, though, given that the joint development will solve our “ migration problem. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem may be valid in the elections, economically but it is very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As this is reminiscent of the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional PhD: how Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 page.): between specialist, there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, employment and wages in countries that immigrants are taking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Restrictions on immigration is paralyzed by the growth and employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Concerns about the impact caused by the migrants are based on the idea that these people may replace french workers, particularly those less - skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants, adding more than náhradníky for french workers by doing work in sectors with a shortage of staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">Few skilled immigrants in sectors that nepřitahují french employees, and the most skilled in fast - moving sectors in which education is not enough supply of jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The positive impact on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As well as the surgeon will have trouble with work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesteziologů, this supplement between the French and the migrants are causing that came the immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of french employees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri and reckons that growth of migratory movements of 1% to spark a long - term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And while it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of přinášená immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalizovaných immigrants among America 's conduits of Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been based immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Migrants are also in european countries net contributors to the social systems for an average of 1% of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">The World Organisation of work, for example, estimates that in Germany one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring for their whole lives to public budgets net contribution (revenue minus spending) of 150,000 Hiroshima euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy said at the start of his mandate desire is for the lack of growth in “ with vyceněnými teeth. ”</seg>
<seg id="25">The teeth to deter immigrants should have just the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="4">Despite voluntaristickou public policy, introduced in R. 2005, is the percentage of unemployed disabled two more times higher than average, i. e., 19% compared with 9% of the population.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is a depressing?</seg>
<seg id="6">“ No, underscoring the likewise Blanchet, director - general of the Association of Adapt, which organizes a week for employing disabled. ”</seg>
<seg id="7">“ The advances made for 15 years are remarkable. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">“ At the time, it was the percentage of unemployed twice, but three times. ”</seg>
<seg id="9">“ However, it remains a lot to do. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It has to be said, that for the unemployed disabled people remain numerous obstacles before they came to work.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is an older person: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">Are low - skilled: 80% have no baccalaureate and 2.3 million of university students is only 10 000 disabled.</seg>
<seg id="13">And at the end of the day - long - term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, these are the criteria, which is particularly difficult to return to employment and that they are “ at the heart of the problem, ” according to the Christian Grapina, Director - General of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992, to help companies hire disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So, when it comes to the objective brakes.</seg>

<seg id="19">The last known figures, which come from R. 2008, give equal state of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">“ Now we are moving around 3%, ” says Pierre Blanc, director - general of the organisation Agefiph charged with collecting fees from companies that fail to comply with the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof is in the number of ” fined ” businesses, as well as paid, which have fallen between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit businesses to 46,000 (and of the 606 at 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">“ The law of R. 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc. ”</seg>
<seg id="23">“ But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, particularly in large companies. ”</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Department of work only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 workers employed by disabled workers compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.</seg>
