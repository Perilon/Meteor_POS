</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The story of the liberation of Libyan or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muammar Gaddafi is buried at an undisclosed location in the desert and without him the war is over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It remains to define the winner.</seg>
<seg id="5">As is customary in the county, the Islamists win elections, but it&#39;s about whether moderate or radical.</seg>
<seg id="6">Transitional National Council has agreed to a customary law and sharia, it was an idea we have.</seg>
<seg id="7">Libya will become the country without crime, because the theft is cut hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women can forget about emancipation, potential defectors from the faith awaiting execution, and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Instead people will be dictator company consisting of warring tribes unite the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Libya will order what we can and can not imagine that we certainly do not.</seg>
<seg id="11">But our way of life is neither the only nor the best objectively and probably would not suit for a change just to be mentioned Libyans.</seg>
<seg id="12">Actually, it is surprising that Islamic militants have taken help from the infidels thankful dogs.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sorry it is only that in their view did not follow the NATO bombing of an American general, but Allah, the size of each intervention celebrated hilarious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">So when looking for winners in Libya, the West is among them.</seg>
<seg id="15">We engaged in a firefight, served Islam and our politicians get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally, without a guaranteed profit.</seg>
<seg id="16">After a bad experience fresh from Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya does a militarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus there is no problem with the local expulsion of &quot;crusaders&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="18">They will have no occupation but the oil companies for a song Libyan black gold?</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps not, and the West will finally be able to boast selfless protection of human rights.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Stylist must also be a good psychologist, says pros</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the opening article on how to teach stylists, I complained a bit that this was the opening hours of the lot.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had no idea what will follow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lectures three pros in the field, troubled characters and dressing up a seminar on how to go about the place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even if the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, is really &quot;crack&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we discussed with the director Alenka (of course not the only boy), dressed as a woman who has a perfectly symmetrical figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And such is the vast majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Someone has a short neck, boyish figure someone again without the proper curves and again someone overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stylist must know how to visually soften broad shoulders, neck and extended to provide the necessary curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We got the tips on how to type in a woman Jennifer Lopez, that is, larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, nice figure and emphasize a woman simultaneously neobléknout too provocatively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">For example, if the difference between waist and hips such that the skirt or trousers really does not fit, then it pays to have at least one such tailor-made piece.</seg>
<seg id="14">Certainly you will not regret it perfectly fitting clothing is priceless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The tailored skirt, you will feel much better than the one that will constantly shifting, rolled up, standing off at the waist and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Boys turn the character can afford to wear clothing with folds, applications, or by collecting embroidery.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Such information and types of characters is of course a lot, so I&#39;m glad I have a whole week for me to have all the information summarized in the head.</seg>
<seg id="18">And, I&#39;m afraid that due to the given homework that is enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each is given kurzistek assigned celebrity, which has come up with two outfits: day and evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">We must take into account the current design, fashion style and the personality type of character.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I will &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria&#39;s Secret campaigns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the spirit of rejoicing for me personally, definitely better than those Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained a hundred pounds (Please keep in mind hyperbole), Selena Gomez or wort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Clothes have to cut out from magazines or search online and print graphically and then processed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moodboard as a whole the result says, and then express our personal style and relationship to graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Think about the graphical styling is important.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stylist is neobléká only physically, but also creates a so-called product pages for example in magazines (to specific tasks, such as trends, handbags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">Told us about that stylist and designer Mario Stonemason.</seg>
<seg id="28">But until Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Stylist must have a general overview</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturday charged a lecture about the types of characters diversified by three guests from the field.</seg>
<seg id="31">Stylist Jan Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.</seg>
<seg id="33">A good stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">Variability in this case is crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So to be such a trench coat (or if you originally Trenchcoat) can be worn over jeans and classic t-shirt as a jacket, but you can also put on the bare body, put on heels and a dress shoot.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just roll up our sleeves and collar, and now the whole look is different.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;Play with it,&quot; stressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But I most appreciated the following advice: &quot;The work you need to know the rules perfectly.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="39">&quot;Then you can begin to break,&quot; said James.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, it is clear to me why we excel in all these propositions, combined with what what, what, why, when yet in fashion magazines, sometimes we see something else.</seg>
<seg id="41">The shows not to mention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to photographer Ben again, I know that stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing options than they shoot it.</seg>
<seg id="43">So the fashion story that will have ten pages (ie, ten outfits), I have to be prepared &quot;nastajlovat&quot; at least fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And that dress in the photo looks and works in combination with other pieces of sometimes very different than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With that, we have to count when making outfit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Image and style that often makes up half the success, we confirmed John Pokorny.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna, the singer is not exactly magic, but the image and marketing made her a world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic has access to use the services of stylists rather cold.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even familiar faces can sometimes considered unnecessary (just know that something I can do, how I look at it, is secondary).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if you already have from us lets anyone create styling, then we have to keep in mind that we are likely to dictate a completely different (smaller) size than actually has.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then the left than Google&#39;s and find out if the tabloids did not write that, given celebrity ztoustla / lost weight and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">John and Mary on Sunday, we put on the heart, the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion and be able to put together outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">In my work primarily communicates with people dressed, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">Be able to assess people nepodbízet to stand up for their opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">&quot;If you ordered a manager to her wardrobe protřídili and added some nice pieces of it, so it can not throw a box and say, God, that&#39;s awful.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="56">&quot;There are a couple of things to praise and recommend what you can wear,&quot; says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He showed us concretely what to include so-called &quot;placovka&quot; or bag set.</seg>
<seg id="58">It&#39;s the one you turn around your waist and you possess all the necessary accoutrements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In addition to clear things like scissors, roll the hair or safety pins, there are also nylon thread (it helps with your stylist photography products such as handbags and hats), special clips, which closes behind clothing if it is greater (pin or other terminal is not permitted, destroying the clothing), or sewing kit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">We just did not hear them, but they also tried practically anything, we learned how to podlepit shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even when shooting in the studio, where a flat surface, it may damage the sole, let alone outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">So we are stuck and stuck.</seg>
<seg id="63">Using scissors, the bot must not even touch that accidentally damaging.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is really necessary skill.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario comforted me when my work unqualified praise.</seg>
<seg id="66">Advertised skill is really not my friend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a tiny fraction of what we continue on the second weekend of the course hear.</seg>
<seg id="68">It starts me to be more and more clear that given the styling on a professional level is really not a cakewalk, let people say what he wants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Need for Speed: The Run is a race across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Originally carefree ride due to a series of sloppy mistakes entirely unnecessary changes in the routine way to the morning shift.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ambition is true to a large extent managed to fill, but it&#39;s not valid when you obviously did not want anyone to do anything extra.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">New volume, subtitled The Run alert before the high expectations.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised that the long-standing racing series Need for Speed ​​again moves towards a new piece of playable demos and appeared to be a game that would be in the genre of action may not be racing in just a number.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were also curious about what happens inserted passages in which the main character of the car and will be held at his.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As NFS series but it is customary, many of them in slightly different result than we expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are potentially decent arcade racing, but a whole pulls down a few unnecessary errors that appear in a series of more or less for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So it&#39;s actually not even mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible speech lazy developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">You mentioned a story whose main character Jack has some problems of a personal nature and is offered as a solution to participate in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea brings some interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into ten stages, and then to more than fifty races.</seg>
<seg id="16">It follows that every race goes to the track and the other stages are set in different, different enough and interesting environment.</seg>
<seg id="17">One does not have a moment to feel that the game offered the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some of the environment are also very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of graphic works in line with previous series.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it&#39;s not much to brag about.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the journey across the desert, autumn landscape, or high in the snowy mountains has very visually pleasing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Races are also diversifying from time to time some atypical feature.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the desert, for example přimotáte to sandstorms, which greatly reduces visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">In contrast, in the mountains again you have to be careful that you nezasypala avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, they are well deployed behind the races.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although there are only a few types, but just that.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is trying to overtake the number of opponents (in fact a classic race), then again catching up with time (a classic duel with a stopwatch) and then waiting for you to be a duel with a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this still from time to time and the police alike, that all your efforts even more disturbing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">New passages are outside the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rather, it is just such an interactive animation, mostly from Jack when someone flees him and you in that you must help so that in just the right moments print button.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Surprise, however, that these passages in the game is much less than you&#39;d expect (specifically, perhaps only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">In the end, but it&#39;s a good thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying in the context of the said amount is now one of the elements that punctuated the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Driving model goes in the footsteps of previous episodes.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that today it is definitely not who knows what, but you can not say that was negative.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But akčněji conceived of the local road racing model fits still quite good, although at the competition we could find better.</seg>
<seg id="37">So far, everything is in perfect order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But problems begin to appear after some time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the model is already driving power in the collision model is not okay.</seg>
<seg id="40">Since we do not expect this type of game that calculates the complex deformation and collision, but when virtually no impact to the front of any object you do not have the slightest idea how to maintain your car, it probably is not everything in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typically close to overtaking or passing cars in normal operation is sometimes only lightly lick each other, but sometimes in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild spins.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or even straight to smithereens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system restarts it although not particularly mind, but your moods, it reliably.</seg>
<seg id="44">Restarts are designed so that if you ride away or smashed off the track, the game throws you back to the last clue on the track.</seg>
<seg id="45">But restarts in each race only five available.</seg>
<seg id="46">When you reach, you must start the race again.</seg>
<seg id="47">So it is rather a dummy, in case something goes wrong than that you could literally they rely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">But sometimes even reboots do not help solve the need to learn by heart the section of the race.</seg>
<seg id="49">A great infirmity game is that the same things often happen in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some of the corners so as to test the specific way, otherwise it simply will never enter into them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sometimes you will meet again at the place of &quot;civilian&quot; cars always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">It sucks, especially in situations when you see oncoming cars between two rival easily passes in front of you while you drive when there are no cars in a position that you must slow down or detour.</seg>
<seg id="53">It does not matter when they arrive, because it is &quot;calculated&quot; to a given situation was always close to your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents also have another advantage.</seg>
<seg id="55">To play all the time you come across a few places where you, again regardless of the time, always overtakes the same opponent in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">Most striking is the conclusion of the game on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The adversary must be there before you get obviously perhaps at any price.</seg>
<seg id="58">When going before you, giving you an overview of the worse because of oncoming cars, so there are probably a couple of times initially rozmašírujete nicely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">One can understand the intention to make the game exciting and adrenalinovější, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgusted.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it&#39;s a shame, because despite the simple model is driving fun and playing well enough action points that sometimes literally are not able to see where that flies.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it basically does not matter if it has the merit concept with fifty unique track, shifter races to boredom no chance, or anything else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Unconventional idea is to change cars during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">Care must be taken at a gas station along the roads, because there you can change the car, although in most cases to make do with what you have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sport cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American Muscle Cars on the highway straight and exotic supercars on technical riding, for example, the winding mountain roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The main narrative mode goes hand in hand mode challenges, which are plants in different locations, you know the story.</seg>
<seg id="67">You get not only medals, but experience points to your profile, which is common to call the story.</seg>
<seg id="68">To obtain higher levels of driver unlock various things: cars starting and ending with backgrounds for your profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">He is also connected again with online functions Autolog, which also compares your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the more difficult the situation is understandable kicks from the last race in the story.</seg>
<seg id="71">With his car to get to the subway tunnel (okay), where a woman in the dark tracks (okay).</seg>
<seg id="72">The tachometer will flash numbers between 150 and 200 km / h (be it) and it comes in from behind the kit and uncompromisingly underground sešrotuje you.</seg>
<seg id="73">The editors are probably more so for a few days last debate on whether to create games no one really thought a little, or whether the authors have for us really as big a fool.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical aspect of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is usually very pleasant and in some cases even great.</seg>
<seg id="75">So pity that in some tenser moments decreases imaging, and in some cases, tragically enough.</seg>
<seg id="76">This applies to crashes but also a number of participants, which would give you a smooth imaging was not valid anyway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Audio page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In an effort to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audience was the soundtrack from &quot;other dog every village&quot;, but it can be assumed that because the game listening to music just about anyone will buy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game is completely avoiding unnecessary mistakes, then we were not afraid to say that the best is The Run NFS work over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="81">Way but the game has not finished.</seg>
<seg id="82">Entertainment is certainly fine, but be prepared that errors will batter you in the eye power of airport lights.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brand story:</seg>
<seg id="2">Innovator IBM begins its second century of existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If anyone was looking for a word that expresses precisely the strategy IBM, the closest would probably be &quot;patient&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, yet since it was founded a hundred years have passed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of the sustainability of the company laid the first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr..</seg>
<seg id="6">Already he coined the slogan that many of the world&#39;s problems can be easily resolved if people are willing to think.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His motto, &quot;Think!&quot; imprint that happened around which life will depend on future giant (and also called internal magazine that began publication in IBM back in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">Watson was also the basis of a carefully crafted corporate culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">&quot;For us, of IBM&#39;s long-term thinking means a continuous movement toward the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years that remained true to its core values ​​and yet afraid everything else around you change.</seg>
<seg id="11">This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second hundred that we manage to achieve even more, &quot;said the anniversary of the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Sophisticated system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson approached the thirties to care for their employees as an entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people at IBM were among the first U.S. employees paid leave, insurance from the employer plus employee uniforms elegant and sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and businessmen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Equally sophisticated and IBM has a long relationship with the customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was brilliant from the start of mining talent - one of the first world companies abolish any discrimination, so you can choose from.</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with the strategy of anti-discrimination is the current plan, headed by Palmisano that IBM will succeed in the next year a woman - Virginia Rometta.</seg>
<seg id="18">The IBM has been working for thirty years, yet he is the boss of sales, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in recent years makes the so-called yams, online brainstorming sessions, which raises many of the strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not surprisingly, the idea is enough - the company operates nearly half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Fixed position in the company&#39;s business provides a strong internal and external image.</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;From the beginning the concept was IBM&#39;s institutions rather than just technology companies,&quot; said the Economist Harvard Business School professor and author of books about IBM Kanter Rosabeth Moss.</seg>
<seg id="24">&quot;IBM is not a technology company but a company that helps solve problems for Business use technology,&quot; said George Colony of Forrester Research consulting firm.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself says, the difference between the market and enter the market directly create.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or &quot;Big Blue&quot; as it is because of its logo in the United States familiarly dubbed - in a hundred years has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is probably the most versatile technology company - develops hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting and consulting services in the range of products, from servers to nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">He holds the most U.S. patents in all technology companies and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among her inventions are to be ATM, credit card, financial swaps, bar code or disk.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM has around 220 billion dollars this year became the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), the first time since 1996, ahead of Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations to hit the taste of customers and time - for example, IBM failed to bet on their own operating system, OS / 2, on-line services and Prodigy IBM PCjr.</seg>
<seg id="33">&quot;If your business is built on moving forward, emotionally can not draw on the past,&quot; poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM has no problem to build their foundations on many platforms - and when not working, so leave it.</seg>
<seg id="35">In contrast to Microsoft&#39;s competition, which basically stands or falls on the Windows operating system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Technology Perspective</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">IBM in sales is primarily attributable to service, after about one fifth of them are software and hardware.</seg>
<seg id="38">It still was in 1990 with more than half of the strongest representative of the hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $ 15 billion during the same period of $ 58 billion invested in the purchase of promising technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">The investment is continuing since 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM is by reference to his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the volume of investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">So far it seems that IBM through the current crisis intact.</seg>
<seg id="43">IBM&#39;s share price since the beginning of 2008 rose 120 percent of the rocket, the company net profit has grown continually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">IBM&#39;s corporate motto to change everything, but their values ​​Sun</seg>
<seg id="45">It can therefore expect that even if there will be another crisis, this giant flexible it can handle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">History of IBM: From cheese slicers for space flights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally had a difficult Computing Tabulating Recording the name of the Corporation.</seg>

<seg id="49">The basis for the subsequent merger of IBM gave four companies whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.</seg>
<seg id="50">Owned technologies such as the famous &quot;time clock,&quot; the clock record the employee&#39;s arrival and departure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Architect of the new company was businessman Charles Flint Ranlett, which until 1930 also chaired the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint hired a chief competitor of Thomas J. Watson to help him with the management company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The leader then overshadowed by the founder of IBM - Watson at the thought still built invincible corporate culture and identity.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the company until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of machines for all sorts of business - from meat and cheese cutters after the box office.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years since Watson headed the company, turnover has doubled to nine million dollars and began an extensive expansion of firms in all continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was indispensable for the company so that after almost forty years in the chair, his place and he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM has begun work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the sixties, people and computers from IBM helped manage NASA&#39;s space flights - the Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the moon.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.</seg>
<seg id="61">Classic &quot;PC,&quot; which raised the standard of computer time, called the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold its PC production to Lenovo of China, on the contrary acquired the consulting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully focus on consulting and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, which in the past three years paid IBM - Smarter Planet is a concept, a &quot;smarter planet&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="64">Its aim is to use smart technologies yet to be or unplanned areas, such as improvements in transport and urban governance.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">As prices have developed tours since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989, Czechoslovakia was allowed to travel only five state agencies Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Rekrea Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies at the time sold only in the vast majority of trips to the socialist bloc countries, since travel to the west was very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Czech tourists to travel on vacation to the beach to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the USSR (the Crimea Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Lake Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav regime, however, inclined to the West and Czech tourists travel to Yugoslavia were consequently very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (ie, the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel individually or in the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen wanted to leave Czechoslovakia individually such as in Poland or the Soviet Union and this country need an invitation letter to an individual not otherwise be possible path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agencies offer at the time and travel to the West, but had to stand the queue overnight sleeping bag or a travel agent to have &quot;known good&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even so, it was won.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called. exchange promise, which was a condition for traveling to the West, was awarded the &quot;politically unreliable people&quot; who do not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Czechoslovak currency is not freely convertible currency, without the promise of foreign exchange was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on a journey to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But by far the most Czechs spend holidays at home, which was due to a large number of lodges and cottages, which the Czechs procure and this custom still survives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Travelling Czechs and since 1989 has experienced a real revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While the year 1989 was a holiday in the GDR and Bulgaria to our maximum, Czechs spent last year abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Great paradox that you already realize, is that for us to present the most popular in Croatia was not possible to travel freely in 1989 as it was then part of Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just early 90th of the last century there was a visa waiver to neighboring Western European countries, which started a huge wave of mainly short-term visits Vienna in Austria and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">Czechoslovaks could not get enough of the long trips to the West, where everyone wanted at least a second look.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in Paris tours Czechs slept in tents in parks, because then our income did not allow us to be able to pay hotel or guest house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of the Czechs were traveling in the car at your own meals, canned foods, sausages, etc., in order to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of convertible Czech crown, and our tourists could finally, after many years destítkách freely buy Western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and thus the average salaries rose, however, which resulted in around 1997 another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With increased demand for travel agents began traveling regularly since 1997 to prepare the charter air travel connections, making air travel thanks to the contracted volume discounts compared with the past incredibly cheaper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">End of the 90 of the last century had already Czechs visa virtually all developed countries except the U.S., which continues to facilitate our travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred once in 2000 when he was dispatched by strong demand from the Czech Republic&#39;s first ever direct charter flight to the exotic, it was in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">From this year, so each year with Czech tourists vylétávají direct charters to warmer far-off lands, this winter will fly directly from CR longer than twelve exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Exotic currently visiting the country has around 100 thousand Czechs year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another interesting point in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">17th November 2008 canceled U.S. visas for Czech tourists and thus our country definitely ranks among the most advanced country in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, Czechs spent time in history more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and the first time ever spent on a holiday abroad, including the cost of the whereabouts of more than 15 thousand. CZK per person.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The General Assembly is to find the President, but again there is a stalemate</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months without football, the Czech President and the risk that successor Ivan Hasek led the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not know for another EGM to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Still, there is no agreement, according to what the Electoral Code to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without it even begins to vote on which of three candidates will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="5">Interest in Czech football have lead Rajchl Henry, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hasek, resigned in June and called upon his retirement colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the era after Hasek slid back to the football between the two půtkám svazovými chambers, which are unable to agree on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It fully proved 16th September, when the new president should be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates to the General Meeting of the National House in Prague arrived in vain, because the negotiations remain blocked and was not just a method of choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus regarding the right to vote at the meeting actually - if only statutory representatives or officials authorized power of attorney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point, since there was a partial match, which helped the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law under which the representation by proxy is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there are still disputes about the electoral code.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Too light on the situation nor did introduce the executive committee, which has at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in fact does not solve anything.</seg>
<seg id="14">View of the option is changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round, to prevent the heel?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">&quot;The dispute is over whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or find a different model,&quot; said one of three vice FAČR Dusan Svoboda, who represents the association in the management of professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round of the winning candidates will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, which stands for.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is reportedly willing to go to the concession to win the candidate who obtains a higher percent of the total votes of both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">A Czech side enforces the condition that the winner in this percentage must get at least two-thirds census superiority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">&quot;But it would make sense then forfeit two previous rounds, it would completely negate the concept of a bicameral,&quot; understands the Freedom Moravian objections, that would be the best choice of procedure and not bending under the applicable statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">With this agrees surprisingly well Paclík Thomas, although it is estimated that the statutes designated election procedure meets most of all candidates Pelt.</seg>
<seg id="22">&quot;I wish to be voted up by the statutes.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;That is nonsense did not invent a wildcard as the last General Assembly,&quot; said owner Victoria Plzen, which stands for the first time and in explaining their observations, especially against the Pelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelt remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Nymburk according to him, the new president know and believe that the candidates together will work constructively in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;All passions soothe any progress today on the national team championship.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="27">&quot;Football is again a happy wave will be greater willingness to cooperate,&quot; said Officer Jablonec, which has all three of the greatest football management experience in both professional and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is restrained.</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;I hope the agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much torn.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="30">&quot;It&#39;s the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adjust the assigned requirements.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="31">&quot;This can cause the block to the General Assembly will again.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="32">&quot;But I hope that sanity will prevail,&quot; said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The agreement of all parties have much time left.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the match will not complete football generals.</seg>
<seg id="35">Aerial special in which they travel to Podgorica including Vice Dalibor Rajchl and Kucera, namely from Prague in the morning due to a technical failure has not flown away, looking for the alternative option as part of the Executive Committee to deliver a venue barážové retaliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Finally, it may be a crucial meeting at ministerial level, which may be alleged in the center.</seg>
<seg id="37">Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobes would like to split caused by the strongest within the sports associations in the country to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">The game is a lot: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming General Meeting of CSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport Sazka after financial problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík going to fight for the President because there is no suitable candidate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the head football Plzen Tomas Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate that would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor to fight for the top position known.</seg>
<seg id="41">&quot;If there was a good novice, I&#39;m fighting for it and going into the election.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="42">&quot;But the current situation could not find anyone like,&quot; said ČTK Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The battle with Miroslav Pelt and Henry Rajchl herds Paclík motivation to just Pelt, alleged election favorite, tried to avoid the journey to lead FAČR.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also points out that if his victory would be as President lasted only until 2013, when the scheduled Annual General Meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the future, the function would like to see an experienced and top executive who is not linked to football events.</seg>
<seg id="46">&quot;With some people who would come into consideration, I have spoken.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="47">&quot;For me it was crazy, though some say that at this moment, with the Czech football do not want to identify.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="48">&quot;Such a sight I would like to change,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Paclík says now matters more than anything else Peltovo liaison with the President by Regional Football Association Berbrem Roman, a man with a controversial reputation, which is known backstage as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting delegates at the General Meeting.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclík is so unacceptable that Pelt became the presidential position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">&quot;If they won, so the pause button on the current state and nothing in football should not move forward.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="52">&quot;In combination with support Berbra who is savvy trader, it did not help even more football,&quot; said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Impact and that the name Peltovo years ago came the wiretapping in the investigation of corruption scandals, of which, however, Pelt went unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">&quot;I do not know what prestige would Peltovo football victory would bring.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="55">&quot;And we also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, but that it also takes it easy with his former statement that would &quot;sell Pilsener Club, Pelt if he became chairman.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the event that Paclík in Thursday&#39;s election triumph, he could have imagined but Pelt future cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Just considering other candidate Rajchl which Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">&quot;He (Pelt) would be the first for whom I went.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="59">&quot;He has great ability.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="60">&quot;I could imagine him to be as head of representation.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="61">&quot;But a manager should manage the association failed.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="62">&quot;I also nestrkám nose where it can not,&quot; said Paclík, in September attracted much attention by standing for appeal of arbitration commission headed by Ludek Mácel, which replaced the Damková Dagmar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík claims that he dared to lead the association.</seg>
<seg id="64">Refers to the ability of its management of private companies since last summer boss also Pilsen, with its support in May celebrated the premiere league triumph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">&quot;I have to force it to be in a football environment has changed something to contribute to its particular culture.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="66">&quot;To reduce the effects of some interest groups that tend to be disciplinary influence and Appeal Board, which treats up to unsavory situations,&quot; said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, the Spartan chief Daniel Křetínskému.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">One of the priorities would also consider a closer relationship with FAČR Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of political leaders should lobby for it to get into the sport more money from the lottery tax.</seg>
<seg id="68">&quot;It&#39;s one of the key things that should give the new President.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="69">&quot;If there is a gambling tax to declare a political party, so I understand their argument, but frankly have to say where the money will go,&quot; he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">As a burden now does not Paclík its association with Pilsner club, although he claims that the President FAČR should be &quot;non-partisan.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelt is in turn associated with Jablonec, Dukla Prague with Rajchl.</seg>
<seg id="72">&quot;It&#39;s not ideal.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="73">&quot;I do not see nor sense in me hypocritical for someone transferring their shares in the Pilsen club and a year and a half back there,&quot; said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelt FAČR promised new statutes that would eliminate the electoral stalemate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the football associations of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that, if elected, endeavor to have FAČR new statutes that would definitely avoid future disputes over election rules.</seg>
<seg id="76">Jablonec Thursday before the official is acting in Nymburk optimist and believe that the election campaign substantially dampen the potential success of today&#39;s football team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelt had not made before the September option promised that on the representation and acquisition finance, if elected, intends to concentrate.</seg>
<seg id="78">The last elections before the General Assembly decided to go at the last minute, so he could throw a two-month delay to his ideas about the governance of football defended and presented in a broader context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">&quot;People at all levels of football are doing for a long time and expect that on Thursday the President of the unknown.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="80">&quot;I feel it is high time that someone has led the association,&quot; says a man who is primarily associated with jabloneckým club, but who for years worked in Sparta and Union Executive Committee.</seg>
<seg id="81">I therefore believe that he has enough experience to be able to manage the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He believes that the current problems with the choice of the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="83">&quot;Unfortunately, the June general meeting were approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="84">&quot;If they did not permit different interpretations, we had a President since September,&quot; said Pelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It is the most important document processing Civic Association took delegates as bait.</seg>
<seg id="86">&quot;If I become President, I&#39;ll take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to give personal responsibility if they fail.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="87">&quot;It&#39;s a matter of principle, without which we can not be,&quot; said Pelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Beyond trying not to identify the allegedly against their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">He had announced that you can imagine Rajchl collaboration with Henry, which recognizes právnickému due to his education, and knows that his opponent was his first deputy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">Long did not attack nor Thomas Paclík that contrary to the thread Pelt let dry.</seg>
<seg id="91">&quot;In football moves over a year, has won some successes.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="92">&quot;His attacks were disgraceful and a lot of people way the campaign by surprise.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="93">&quot;That is why many are now doubts about his real character,&quot; said Pelt opponent&#39;s address, which apparently remains faithful proclamations which announced in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His strongest weapon is in his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest to the representation.</seg>
<seg id="95">This should be a showcase for football.</seg>
<seg id="96">&quot;And I was trying to end all scandals from the Bohemians and the aftermath of scandal corruption scandal last year.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="97">&quot;Immediately after I threw the negotiations with the private and public sectors, to ensure enough money for the football,&quot; said ČTK šestačtyřicetiletý candidate two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">At that time, vowed that his arrival at the head of football would not involve any personal cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="99">&quot;I would first meet with the filling of individual employees,&quot; sent a message to Strahov, where a long interregnum, there is understandable nervousness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the forthcoming General Assembly, believes that the delegates not traveling on Thursday to Nymburk unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="101">&quot;If the only point of contention is how it will vote in the third round, and through it we can bring.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="102">&quot;Football needs credibility, and the only gains that will finally turn their leader,&quot; Pelt remains perhaps two days before deciding on his career functionaries optimist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that underneath the hard work began FAČR</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If the new Chairman of Football Association of the Czech Republic in Thursday&#39;s general meeting elected the current Vice-President Henry Rajchl, many people said the association would be pleased.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that if elected his hard work begins.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants to promote systemic change and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football field.</seg>
<seg id="107">It also promised to resolve the case against the Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football bring in more money and continue the work begun by the previous chairman Ivan Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">&quot;As President I would like to football as a whole.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="109">&quot;The international contacts with UEFA and FIFA over representation, professional football, football performance by young people.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="110">&quot;But that&#39;s not to say that I did everything myself,&quot; he said in an interview Rajchl ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">&quot;I am a team player and I want to split the Executive Committee of competence so that each member gave a certain area.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="112">&quot;And I will give hard tasks to each segment that kicked a soccer mile step forward.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="113">&quot;Many people would have done some fun, because it started to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others,&quot; he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Due to the critical atmosphere in a football movement apparently thought that it would not stand again.</seg>

<seg id="8">For citizens of the federal thing is clear: 84% of Germans, according to one study considers it unacceptable that banks speculating in agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of respondents even require that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions stood out from this business because it deepens the problems of the poorest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result Forsa poll on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report by Foodwatch presented in mid-October.</seg>

<seg id="21">Ackermann is working on your self image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The head of the organization Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but also intensified his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically, regardless of how banks today harms the common good.&quot;</seg>

<p>
<seg id="26">Ackermannův preview appears at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the concern boss a few months before his departure from office would like to leave a perfect image.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the boss of the Board other than planned, the supervisory board does not move.</seg>
<seg id="28">Diversion from the controversial agrarian speculation could improve its image.</seg>

<seg id="4">The story of architecture, with peaks, falls a happy ending: Austrian Pavilion at the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 prices gained, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and dilapidated.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When the mountain of postwar modern architecture, to form a clear, glass halls, daring booms and new building materials that are typical of the faith in technological progress, then the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzera pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 and famously concise example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzerův pavilion had received the Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture for his light and graceful acting construction of steel and glass.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is still considered a milestone of modern architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Famous architect, so that also for the next World&#39;s Fair pavilion built in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace made plus side as the key building in Munich, eventually became famous internationally in 1973.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its construction as a temporary exhibition pavilion designed by the World Exhibition located in Vienna at the Schweizer Garten Südbahnhof (South Station), reconstructed in 1962 the Museum opened the 20th century - was named as the &quot;House of the 20th century.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="12">Suitable for the museum building but was not technically or spatially - missing wall for hanging art exhibits, a suitable climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yet was used until the forthcoming contemporary art in Vienna a new stand.</seg>
<seg id="14">From 2001 the building was empty and deteriorated more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now architect Adolf Krischanitz reconstructed pavilion, now bears the name &quot;House of the 21st century&quot; and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday evening there opens the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace is the first exhibition - a happy plan in every respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">It has been recognized a new beginning Agnes Husslein-Arco, which in 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, among other things, figure skater in her youth, and later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, reconstruction strongly pushed by politicians and conservationists, sought public funding and private sponsorship money and designated uses.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to contemporary art should be exhibited sculptor Fritz Foundation Wotruby same name, it should arise cafe and bookstore, and had to be built to an office building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision, low budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The design was then Krischanitz ideal cast.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only that sensitively refurbished and expanded the building by Joseph Olbrich Art Nouveau in Vienna and won the competition, but because of Schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him &quot;an extremely important place&quot; in which he &quot;almost every weekend,&quot; viewed the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the primordial project and knew the problems of building that is in their relocation to Vienna and change of use has lost its generosity and lightness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">During the recent reconstruction were far greater problems: The building was a &quot;catapult for energy,&quot; says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">Profiles of the facade glass windows were replaced, used glass fiber reinforced glass and insulating glass roof replaced with special safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cold-steel girder bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings redeveloped.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two underground floors provide space for new uses, recessed lighting channel between the building and street lighting caters to the entrance bridge leads - almost new building, but still magnificent Schwanzerův pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original entrance doors have been preserved, the building is painted in the old anti-rust colored reddish tone.</seg>
<seg id="29">A cinema is even exactly the same as that used to be before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all under strict supervision Heritage Office and the low budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">&quot;I often had to be found material that is good and cheap and also appealed to památkovému office,&quot; says Krischanitz and highlights broken basement floor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction of the building remained flexible and airy.</seg>
<seg id="33">Difficult it was apparently with the pavilion, &quot;which arrived here from Brussels,&quot; he said recently Krischanitz, a typical &quot;Drop-in-the-City-history.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="34">Such an architecture is said to &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;give adequate confidence.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, but not House 21st inappropriate place for centuries, as happened to urban fluke: In the circle around Schweizer Garten creates a completely new designed &quot;Urban district near the main railway station&quot; with office and residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="36">And perhaps there is another happy coincidence: House 21st century could receive support from another building Krischanitzovy as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporary Kunsthalle and what is heard, it is a city of neighborhoods in the habitat in the Schweizer Garten.</seg>

<seg id="5">This message is in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and worry.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because for many German Turks back the specter that has long been considered dead: From arson in Mölln in November 1992 and in the Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable right-wing extremist violence in the background.</seg>
<seg id="7">That in Germany there are about xenophobia but never in doubt.</seg>

<seg id="9">&quot;Bloody ideology alive again?&quot; sounded subtitles web edition of Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; by contrast, emphasize that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police agent of the Department for Protection of the Constitution and the fear that the German authorities could be implicated in the radical right-wing swamps.</seg>

<seg id="14">As boxes are works of several Turkish news media: &quot;A gift to the fiftieth Germany&quot; is the title of the article in the Turkish internet platform &quot;Haber X,&quot; which reports on a series of murderous background.</seg>

<seg id="19">Why not think the German authorities much earlier, after searching the suspected right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scandal at the bank of Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Europe&#39;s most adventurous bank is not established in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">UBS has suffered a financial crisis nearly bankrupt, and since then glides from one crisis to another.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it has a German comparison.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So it certainly did not think Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his noisy departure from the front lines of the Federal Bank became known in July, 2013 to the board almost as spectacular new job: President of the Board velkobanky Swiss UBS - an unexpected step in and lucrative career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber was looking forward publicly, whether praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound respectability and said a friendly note to future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">&quot;Die UBS achieved a turnover.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="9">&quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübelem&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September it was clear that everything will turn out differently.</seg>
<seg id="11">One dealer from UBS in London, all safety systems bypassed the banks and approximately 1.7 billion euros zmarnil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">UBS chief Oswald Grübel board, not just in Switzerland recognized banker, had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">President of the UBS Board of Directors has since been scalded as well - and we all ask: When Axel Weber finally comes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It became known that Weber from the bank in February 2012 may advise.</seg>
<seg id="15">A assumes the chairmanship in May - not only in 2013 as Bank on Tuesday communicate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber, it will be hard.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is no banker, but rather a professor of economics and emission banker and she would need time to incorporate.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then suddenly assumes responsibility for the bank&#39;s strategy, which was once again proved that it deserves the title &quot;Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe&quot;</seg>
<seg id="19">Because UBS is a giant - until recently was the largest asset manager in the world - both slides and for years from one scandal to another.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing as it seems, left the Swiss bank proud spared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started with the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">UBS until 2007 enjoyed an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Image silent and solid, but also astute trustee is combined with ambitious goals: I mean something in investment banking.</seg>
<seg id="24">So UBS 2007 to manage the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money to wealthy clients than any other bank of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, an investment bank advanced to the league of the world&#39;s largest banks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">It made an impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">Former banker and later a long-time professor of banking at Zurich Hans Geiger says: &quot;I had my students UBS has always featured as a model of good banks.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="28">&quot;In retrospect, one wonders: How could I have just been so wrong?&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Greatly mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, the first obvious that something went wrong at UBS properly.</seg>
<seg id="31">In mid surprisingly resigned chief of the Board Peter Wuffli, who was still regarded as highly intelligent as well as brilliant banker.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later he had suspected why he left.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment bank division Subprime-wasted paper and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">In order to stabilize, UBS announced by a capital increase amounting to 13 billion francs really.</seg>
<seg id="35">But really find investors, but those over which they have recently nose curling manner: Opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one does not learn his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But it was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 a second best-paid Board of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, followed by disaster: UBS was due to their faulty investments on the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nationalbank purchased from UBS tens of billions of questionable securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatory convertible bonds, for which he could become co-owner of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole was shaken Switzerland - as noticed as dramatic for a small country, when their territory is so large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">After all, UBS balance sheet total was 2007 more than five times bigger than Switzerland&#39;s economic performance (see figure).</seg>
<seg id="43">&quot;Once again we were unable to rescue UBS,&quot; said banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster follows another.</seg>
<seg id="45">For several months, surrendered to UBS in a tax dispute with America, and expressed willingness to release data affluent customers if possible for banks to help while away the tax.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition to the agreed payment of $ 780 million - as the recovery of undue profits from these transactions, including penalty surcharges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">This UBS has undergone more or less openly, to assist tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time losing something that was always the capital to compete for rich clients: halo discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After this scandal has been the Swiss banking secrecy what earlier.</seg>
<seg id="50">This was followed by the resignation of the chief of the Board and President of the Board.</seg>
<seg id="51">A customer exodus of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So the bank has lost over several months, your credibility in both the central business areas: investment banking for the poor and speculation in asset management for the facilitation of tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when it calmed down a bit, just as it was thought that UBS is again recovered, here comes this unhappy business adventure: The only dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, it still seems wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">&quot;The case is about Adoboli found that the control of risks has changed very little,&quot; said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance Finanz Banking Institute at Zurich University.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also, Chief Financial Officer large German bank is sure: &quot;The problem is that UBS, the control can not cope with risks.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">However, it was exactly she did the idea of ​​prudence with which Swiss bankers stepped out long ago to become watchdogs of large estates of the world: no undue risks, but security for the money - even on this side of the Alpine republic collapsed world again.</seg>
<seg id="58">Safes Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability Lindt and Sprüngli chocolate for extra quality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">UBS headquarters in Zurich, still fits the cliché of good Swiss private banks - is only slightly larger.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is a classic location.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank is headquartered in Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, is framed by snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Jewelry such as Tiffany&#39;s, the Swiss will find traditional shops such as confectioner Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries, it houses the Swiss banks: from the Nationalbank via the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Baer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The reception hall is entered by UBS heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside the walls are lined with marble, they face a huge leather chair, next to the logo signs to large banks &#39;safe&#39;.</seg>
<seg id="67">UBS knows what customers are looking for: safety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of ​​the two Swiss banks Swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - or betrayed suppressed, finds as chief of a small Swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name would rather not want to read in the newspapers, finally concludes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both velkobankami shops.</seg>
<seg id="70">UBS is probably not increased, the checks - especially in investment banking, where he also expanded the Anglo-Saxons.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss are not about to have something to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">&quot;And if they did, long ago adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS has changed, it brought about high profits initially and then disaster: No European financial institution lost in the jungle around as much money as Subprime Großbank Schweizer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">15th October 2008 disaster was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="75">&quot;At that concluded Wednesday, the coalition government sedmimilionové small country in the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately € 45 billion approved by politicians to save from bankruptcy velkobanku standing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If the talks with Swiss bankers, so they see a problem mainly in the size of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998 he joined two of the three Swiss velkobank into a massive conglomerate.</seg>
<seg id="80">Bank was established that the merger was already too large to small Switzerland - and still continued to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">At the same time conducive to the two different bank UBS predecessor complementary: one rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and poorer, but more strongly engaged internationally.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly came internationalized investment bankers favorably to many money with which to spin the big wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">With the rise of UBS are linked two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 group chief Marcel Ospel and UBS, then Chairman of the Board.</seg>
<seg id="84">&quot;I always thought that Ospel and Wuffli are a team of the future,&quot; said banking expert Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">&quot;Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows much about the models and statistics and Ospel, the person managing the feelings around the stomach, which has been fully developed science bank up.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel said in the end relied on Wuffliho.</seg>
<seg id="87">And at the end Wuffli probably made a critical error: &quot;I thought that its models are a reality,&quot; says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">&quot;This is a tragic case.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">This much is clear: Pride preceded the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">UBS employees can clearly remember the meetings of managers, the chief of the concern which Wuffli repeated again and again the same password: Goldman Sachs knock down from the throne.</seg>
<seg id="92">U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank world.</seg>
<seg id="93">Stated &quot;League Tables&quot; waiting list, which documents the success of banks at that time.</seg>
<seg id="94">In it, she tried to UBS on the location at the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">A few steps she had succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="96">The trade in foreign exchange and equity attended games at the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">Business advisers, who were charged, however, highlight one weakness: The interest rate international trade, bankers in a speech &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, perhaps there is a large gap for the largest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">UBS has some gaps in the American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To conclude this gap, resolved to UBS for adventure that nearly cost her existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, investing the bank itself as well as her fund based on the hedging of investments in U.S. subprime.</seg>
<seg id="101">Has developed into a mighty machine that přebaloval securities on U.S. mortgage loans and passed on - while he himself also left a risk.</seg>
<seg id="102">Also, even when other banks long search for a solution.</seg>
<seg id="103">&quot;In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there,&quot; said banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">How big is the euphoria and deep fall.</seg>
<seg id="105">One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than had been thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Positions at UBS became katapultovacím seat and rock to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Who leads velkobanku now has almost unmanageable work.</seg>
<seg id="108">They must find a strategy for the bank to close all business models disappeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End to investment banking, asset management concentration, a return to Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">Completely so far, although the bank (still) want to go.</seg>
<seg id="111">But investment banking has strongly accommodation, so much is now clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">Next Thursday he wants a new bank boss Sergio Ermotti introduce the world to its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">51-year-old Italian Swiss was actually seen only as an interim solution, surprisingly, when the bank broke its predecessor Grübelem.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, asserted: Does long-term business lead UBS, Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti investment bank wants to give back to the state in the mid-nineties.</seg>
<seg id="116">3500 sites as appropriate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But that&#39;s not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is she?</seg>
<seg id="120">What he wants to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are questions that Axel Weber already considered.</seg>
<seg id="122">But not yet said publicly only that he and his wife first find an apartment in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<seg id="15">Removing nests by spraying with water or felling of trees is often undesirable consequences, he said, also an expert on the environment Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">&quot;Animals give way, a large colony is split and distributed to other places.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="23">&quot;The vacuum resulting from the lack of facts,&quot; noted Mr. Englund, &quot;was filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.&quot;</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">These phrases may look innocent, but no debate, concerning Libya, and has not been easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">During the summer, lawmakers from both parties constantly argued among themselves and with the White House as a series of statements to the contrary, approval or rejection of the United States military role in NATO&#39;s mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, McCain and Kerry introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.</seg>

<seg id="16">&quot;We&#39;re not victims,&quot; ​​said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon leave.</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;But it seems that the only way some of us can support is built into the role of us unfortunate souls.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This topic is very sensitive to army commanders who do not want to seem ungrateful or spoiled relations with the public they serve.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also realize that anger, which had to face once the unit returning from Vietnam, was much worse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The result is that most words of pity is uttered quietly and privately among war veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">When two sons of a retired Colonel Mark Canciana returning from combat operations, serving as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service to people outside the military will look from two angles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">From the perspective of some will feel respect and awe, because the defeated enemy insurgents and visit exotic places.</seg>
<seg id="23">Another but will wonder if the &quot;evil hiding beneath the surface, violent veteran,&quot; said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and on his return took place in Washington in the government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">He claimed that he was looking for a job, some people who do interviews with him, quietly suggested that so soon after returning to the fight can withstand the stress that is associated with work in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">&quot;When you talk about your service, you must expect negative reactions,&quot; he instructed his sons Cancian.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The concern stems from the army of American indifference to the wars.</seg>
<seg id="27">Success on the battlefield rarely reap recognition in a country that has a private army, and little awareness in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a few own benefit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">&quot;As a nation, have military heroism for granted as they used to be common during the Second World War,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barna, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focus mainly on the suffering of men in arms.</seg>
<seg id="30">Soldiers are distinguished for the number of events, which suffered through, a number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Army is facing increasing pressure not to hit hard against rape</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week will decide whether to start trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the case of rape.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they are not prepared to take action hundreds of other applicants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was at night when she was allegedly raped by a colleague from the Army, 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="5">It happened in October 2008, she headed for the barracks at the Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with my friend ran into her male colleague carrying a box with 12 beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked her if she can connect to it, that if he alone could drink a bit.</seg>
<seg id="7">&quot;In my mind flashed a warning light,&quot; described Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the native Texan&#39;s objections completely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: No, he is 19th</seg>
<seg id="10">&quot;He&#39;s from Texas,&quot; she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">&quot;I wish I listened to my instincts.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="12">They argue that only a few minutes after they went into her room, walked over to her husband, threw her on the bed and raped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, 18 November, the Lyman and 27 other current or former military members wait for the verdict hearing that could have historic implications. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will go on whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, he gets to court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The indictment states that Rumsfeld and Gates failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The indictment was filed in February, Washington&#39;s lawyer Susan Burke and the plaintiff at the time had 17 members. During the following months, however, their number has grown to 28 to 25 women and three men, who all claim they were raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and the army after the announcement of these picks have failed in the investigation and punishment of any quest for justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke argues that the neck is the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts right at them.</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;The army&#39;s directive system,&quot; he says.</seg>
<seg id="18">&quot;Who are the people who are in a position that they can avoid trying to introduce measures against such acts? High Command.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also contends that since February contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">Her strategy: Rather than grouped all the allegations in this case - piled all your eggs in one basket, as she says - an action in several different cases, if necessary, the pressure was not relieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ministry of Defence team defending the prosecutor leading the United States Neil MacBride, who along with his colleagues to reject the initiative of the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Court documents obtained by Newsweek, discuss in detail the defense strategy - in essence the point is that current or former army soldiers can not sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the Regulation of the Supreme Court in 1950 called the Feres Doctrine as the federal government is not liable for injuries sustained by soldiers in active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">&quot;The alleged injury to the plaintiffs concerning military service,&quot; says the document.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have not changed since the fifties.</seg>
<seg id="27">Although women are still not officially serve in combat, it is just a quibble: in modern wars, it is difficult to find clear given front line.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers teams played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communication with civilian women occurring in a war zone.</seg>
<seg id="29">Result: the wars between the 150 soldiers killed female - two thirds of them in battle.</seg>
<seg id="30">It&#39;s time to upgrade, it was in the army, says Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In their fight is not alone. In addition to her with the case involved three other attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School Visits veteran preparing a seminar on legal services action on four main military academy for alleged development atmosphere that promotes hatred towards women.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regardless of the non-profit organization of American Vietnam veterans gather evidence for its action directed against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder&quot; which was allegedly found in rape victims to have the army an excuse for their release - according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women&#39;s Action Network, is a completely routine practice.</seg>
<seg id="34">Her group in December filed for actions against the state organization for dealing with veterans, he accuses of discriminatory practices, which should occur during the processing of requests for help from people who claimed they were sexually assaulted on duty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Congress was introduced nine separate proposals put forward by a group of senators and members of both political parties, and they proposed a number of corrective measures.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the agency for preventing and addressing sexual violence, the Ministry of Defence in 2010 reported 3,158 sexual assaults.</seg>
<seg id="37">This type of attack remains mostly unannounced and the Pentagon&#39;s own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents, which occurred in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="38">In a report issued in March is analyzed and the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, the court received 20 percent of cases reported in the army - which is half compared to the civilian judicial system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The claimants in the case of Deputy Burke described the attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Private First Class Lyman reported the alleged rape, such as military police less than an hour after it should have.</seg>
<seg id="41">During the night, he says, was asked to give details about his repeated rape of eleven different members of the police, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">Underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape and her bed was found the blood forward - from the wound, which he did on his arm.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions relating to whether the day of the attack in love with her boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="44">It summons six persons as witnesses to testify in favor of the reputation of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">&quot;I remember the day when the judgment was given,&quot; says Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">&quot;I think right then and there give birth - I ran screaming from the courtroom.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="47">&quot;They placed me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I was his commanding officer said: It was not his trial. Was mine.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman ordered to attend a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which it described as unfit for service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010 the army was without honor, and therefore not entitled to seniority released.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whatever the case Lyman and other applicants will move to the next phase or not, it&#39;s the long run, says John Turley, law professor at George Washington University Law.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, remarks, &quot;From my point of view, should be able to advance to the next stages of negotiation.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="52">Between them and the said verdict, however, is a doctrine that has been criticized from the first moment he saw the light of day.</seg>
<seg id="53">I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The military is decades behind, because their duties do not provide the same level of motivation to comply with incentives and deterrent capability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: &quot;The odds are heavily against them ... but it is important for them to try it.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="56">The change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Unless the hearing decided in their favor, Burkevoá, the plaintiffs lawyer, gathers hundreds of other people ready to take action and begin to work on other matters dealt with regarding this topic.</seg>
<seg id="58">&quot;Not cease with the army to fight on this issue, where there is no reform,&quot; he says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Or until you die, whichever comes first.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: How can scientists have been studying on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before Anders Breivik Behring became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man who presented their views, anti on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday Braivik who admitted the July vraždícímu rampage, which left over 77 dead in Norway, participated in his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although Breivik could act on its own in cyberspace definitely not alone: ​​during the preparation of an attack a lot of time spent at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of supporting right-wing nationalist groups on social networking sites.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn about these people more.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how to find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy - just go to Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">&quot;We realized that the find is not actually all that difficult,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent British research team reports, covering the European digital populism.</seg>
<seg id="9">The supply of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says that scientists enough to simply use advertising on the site and thus determine with absolute accuracy sought demographic group - something that marketers have done for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartlettův team across Europe found half a million supporters of right-wing groups, and then focus attention on them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of through them is invited to the newly created group, or offer them some dietary products, urged them to complete a questionnaire in which they occurred questions regarding their level of education, relationship to violence and optimism in relation to their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Through Facebook to Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave office.</seg>
<seg id="12">&quot;It&#39;s a completely new way of conducting research,&quot; says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, which irritates the growing rate of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But on the other hand, &quot;those who have their online activism combined with off-line activism are wiser, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">DEMOS team work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Research teams, scientists and health policy researchers use these sites to study everything from health issues to social trends lurking status updates, wall posts and pressed the button &quot;I like it.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="17">Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each day will provide an average of three different data, making the social network has made a &quot;supernova information&quot; behind the development of many new research. Number of academic work, in whose name the word occurs Facebook has increased compared to the situation five years ago to almost 800%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some scientists the magic of Facebook lies in the fact that it gives them the opportunity to study people without the hassle on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;Previously it was determined that if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="20">&quot;You&#39;d have to get to the side where you would never let go,&quot; says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">&quot;It all breaks down Facebook - just go directly to them.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify the socio-medical problem and avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outputs on Facebook, were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who remained silent on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suggests that students&#39; peers monitor the site and came up with an offer of help to a student who publishes too many drunken status.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;The problem is not solved if it can not diagnose,&quot; the Washington Post said Dimitri Christakis, co-author Dr. Moreno and Director of the Center for Health, behavior and development of children at the Children&#39;s Research Institute in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;We found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise have a chance to emerge.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook itself constantly probes the data of their users.</seg>
<seg id="28">Information developed by a team of site statistics about the context of relational status and on St. Valentine&#39;s Day, turnout in 2010 and the satisfaction of the nation&#39;s coefficient (mainly using the information to which they had access - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site had its treasure of information made available for research as well as others).</seg>
<seg id="29">But Facebook users know that the page is monitored, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site must provide their personal information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if Facebook users become part of the research, which do not even know?</seg>
<seg id="31">Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. On-line data are not accessible to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="32">&quot;I think most people imagined that scientists could be seen in their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study from 2006, carried out using public facebookových walls of their students.</seg>
<seg id="33">&quot;If they were, they took it so that only the information between them and their friends.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then also consider the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even when off-line research, there is no guarantee that the body is completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook there is no way to verify how much of the information on the profile and contributions to the true wall.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;What do you think about Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, these are two entirely distinct things,&quot; says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why Selwin who spent long years of research into new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook and remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.</seg>
<seg id="39">&quot;When you go into the real world and talk with real people, this is something that can not be replaced,&quot; he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">&quot;Social research should be on the company and social activities - a heck of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line.&quot;</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs Firing in the film to cinemas this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">When Steve Jobs 5th died in October, began to discover the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford - and elected him as its greatest modern genius inventor.</seg>
<seg id="3">The recently rediscovered Jobsově interview, which was dusted for special film, which is heading to theaters this week, will be for all fans of Apple the fact that his creative mind perfectly understand business processes and workflows standing behind his products.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also the organizer and pedantic man who every detail fits into the smallest details - believed that many businesses are suffering, &quot;the notion that truly great idea is 90 percent of their work ... [ but] the great idea and an excellent final product is still a long way to bite work. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob worked on the TV show Cringely Triumph fools computer, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming took place unique, more than an hour interview.</seg>
<seg id="6">By then it was already ten years since Jobs has been forced to leave Apple, and had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and eagerly looking to take the general public access.</seg>
<seg id="7">The TV show was eventually used only a small part of the interview Cringelyho and original copies of the interview was said to have been lost in transit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after the death Jobsově VHS copies were found in the director&#39;s garage.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is this material, slightly edited, is the basis 68minutového image Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which heads into selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who is famous for its reluctance to provide long talks, there has surprisingly Jobs enthusiasm that can be drawn out of his philosophy of technology and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And also proves to be very thoughtful man.</seg>
<seg id="12">Four times during the conversation happens between that question and the answer comes a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, which is seen as the perfect answer then develops Jobs to be as brief and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when the sail surface Jobsův perfectionism, when the issues Cringelyho act impatiently and hurries him to quickly get to important issues and topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The interview was filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone and appear in it frighteningly prophetic thoughts when Jobs assess what other companies are doing well and poorly, but offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.</seg>
<seg id="15">One thing is to read the reviews Jobsovy posthumous career, but for Jobs, whom we see here as eager dreamer in the flowering of his genius is something raw and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">Here has its own vision of how the thing could and should look like.</seg>
<seg id="17">It did not take long, and once expressed his thoughts, he is also put into practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick summary of the seven scenes from Lost interview is definitely worth noting:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">How he learned to manage the business:</seg>
<seg id="20">&quot;During the years in business, I always asked: Why are you doing? And the answer was always the same: Well, that&#39;s how it&#39;s doing.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody knows why he does what he does, never on matters relating to the business does not think in depth.</seg>
<seg id="22">That&#39;s what I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify the accounting in the Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was utterly confused by the way costs have been recorded - often beginning with &quot;standard costs&quot;, their size could only guess. At that moment he decided to go their own way - has developed an automatic tool that guarantees that they could determine the cost of business in no time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As the Pope made mischief:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs says the &quot;Blue Box&quot;, which was constructed with Steve Wozniak - devices that enable people to effectively hack into the phone company and call for free anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">The equipment that was already written in the past many, but Jobsovo thrilled when Blue box describes it as an instrument of power is literally contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">It tells how to Wozniak tested the device using the pay phone during a call and let the swap from one network AT &amp; T to another, while to use as many satellites.</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;At least we půltucetkrát this round twined around the world, so when we then shouted something to the pay phone, it came a minute later from the other phone at the door,&quot; laughs Jobs.</seg>
<seg id="30">&quot;We were young and we found ourselves able to construct something that is able to manage infrastructure worth billions of dollars around the world.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="31">You two have made a tiny little thing who could control a much larger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I would have never been without Apple.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs goes on to describe prank that Wozniak with almost dragged to the end. Through the blue box in the middle of the night called to the Vatican and asked about whether they could speak with the Pope, taking the best posing as Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">Gradually they were called upon more and higher-ranking members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, and only shortly before the phone woke up and the pope himself, the couple laughed and put the handset.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How to fall in love with technology (and telephoned Bill Hewlett)</seg>
<seg id="35">When he was 12 and looking for spare parts, so that he could build a frequency meter, found in the telephone number on the list of Bill Hewlett and called him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Not long after their 20 minutes of conversation already secured Jobs had a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">&quot;Incredibly influenced me. It was the only company that I knew at the time, and shape my view of what it really such a society is and how to treat their employees.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company&#39;s research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="39">He was big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor and I fell in love with him immediately.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a teenager I progressed in HP up and up, I hung around the computer and began to write programs for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">How to invent innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">Jobs at several places during the interview talking about how to invent new products at runtime.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the beginning of his career when he went to sell a pair of printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to put together for him together the whole computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">There had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished device.</seg>
<seg id="45">When he was later at Apple, recalls the challenges faced in the development of a computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">&quot;I remember how we fought quite fiercely ... shouting at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, which would cost 300 USD] when I was bored, I went out and found a designer.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we were able to produce perfectly reliable mouse for 15 USD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">As large companies out of breath:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before leading the resurrection of Apple, Jobs wisely predicted that many industry leaders in their vision falters and loses its market share.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the bill on health care when their case to court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept the challenge to the law of President Obama&#39;s health care, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the gala dinner sponsored by the law firm that will before the court to participate in negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submitted proposals.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the discussed cases the action was raised by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care that Congress approved last year - a law which mobilized conservative activists around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed that the application will listen. In March, however, expected 5.5-hour meeting, the outcome also stirred up even more presidential elections are scheduled for 2012 and at the time a decision will be in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lawyer who confronts the Court and seek to achieve rejection of the law will most likely Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under the George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clement Law Firm, PLLC Bancroft was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner group, which for many years engaged in the defense of conservative principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, representing one of the trade associations challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which they are in the process of a huge stake in the funds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dinner was held in Washington hotel several hours after the court debate on the said case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attended by, among others, also Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and confirmed opponents of the law on health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">And the placing of guests? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">There is nothing new: These two judges are Federalist Society, a group of events involved in for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And certainly it is not even about anything that was contrary to the rules of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, these judges are exempted from the principles of behavior that are subject to lower federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If it was not, their behavior would definitely fall under the principle of C4, which states that &quot;a judge may participate in events that are currently connected and organized by other organizations in order to obtain funds, but a judge may not be speaker, guest of honor, nor be featured at the event. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, Scalia and Thomas relation to the two law firms in the case of performers, as well as companies with huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to alerted activists calling for ethics in government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">&quot;This is a shocking breach of ethics and disregard for the code of conduct is contrary to what some judges, the Supreme Court acts under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;The judges dined and drank at the party benefici with attorneys who are waiting to discuss your case before the court.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines all claims to the legs impartiality, which is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas to their critics have shown little understanding of them and sent word that they also seamlessly combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thomas&#39;s wife Ginny is a senior conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Conservatives have argued that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kaganovich and not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kaganovich worked as Attorney General under President Obama, when he first appeared before a court challenge to the law.</seg>
<seg id="25">Critics Kaganovich pushes her to renounce participation in the case, arguing that the law had fought as much as to now be disinterested.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kaganovich does not indicate that she was about to resign.</seg>

<seg id="1">Warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress really put under the boiler, he warned that the looming automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and financial cause a chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Pentagon will spend an already reduced budget of $ 450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears a further reduction of $ 600 billion if Congress fails to conclude an agreement on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">&quot;The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the whole sector,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the inability of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment causes a 23% fall flat and stop many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">&quot;Because of the huge reduction used in this ill-judged way, you can not do most of our building and marine projects - you can buy only three-quarters of buildings or ships. Could also cause serious damage to other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">&quot;We will also separate the forced many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction take place so quickly, we will almost certainly also need to send civilians forced to leave, we were able to meet targets.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="8">&quot;These changes might shake the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Finally, the cuts also affect the combat units, Panetta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">&quot;Although funding accounts for possible military operations overseas, this obstávka directly affect, the local operations will be adversely affected by significant changes in other budgets,&quot; Panetta warned.</seg>
<seg id="11">&quot;There will be cuts in staff contract, which will result in delays to the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="12">&quot;The reduction will become paid employees of which will flow, delayed payments to contractors and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Both senators, Panetta wrote off ten days ago and asked him for details about the possible consequences of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">&quot;Consequences of the Ministry of Defence obstávky could cause rapid degradation of view of the United States as the world&#39;s military superpower.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;We are strictly against such tough measures,&quot; told senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when a letter published Panettův.</seg>
<seg id="16">&quot;This is not a conclusion with which we could live, and definitely do not want to sign under it.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;The planned cuts are a threat to national security of the United States, which should not happen.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">&quot;It remains to be seen whether Panettův fresh warning letter and will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplifies the voices calling for the Pentagon&#39;s omission from the list seškrtaných areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta was recently in talks on possible cuts becoming more open, although he switched to his high position at the Pentagon with long years of experience to the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that tackles the tough fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference held by Secretary of Defense bypassed week signaled a brief picture of what his department can wait - Army shell, but inside the core is missing.</seg>
<seg id="21">&quot;It will be like a ship without sailors.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="22">&quot;It will be a brigade of ammo.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;It will not trained as an Air Force pilot.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="24">&quot;It will be like a paper tiger, as a military barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission,&quot; Panetta said at the beginning of his speech at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;It will be as a unit with no morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a potential enemy.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;As a result, will welcome aggression ...&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the annex supplied with a letter McCain and Graham Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in &quot;significant operational risks: late reaction to crises, conflicts and disasters, significant reduction opportunities and parachute deployment around the world and has an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Panetta also said that some of the largest defense projects could wait for completion, including those already tested, even those still in early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the list were such as F35 aircraft project, the planned new bomber, submarine ballistic new generation, new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicles, which wanted the army and marines to replace Humvees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Stopping further development and testing of F35 aircraft would be over the next ten years, save U.S. $ 80 billion, but its supporters argue that it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed to deal with potential ground threats from China and other rivals .</seg>

<seg id="1">How to recognize a lie</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A glance at recent headlines suggest, how serious and pervasive are the lies and deception in everyday life.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="9">And never forget the media circus that broke out about Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in office of his sex with Monica Lewinsky Eq.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Everywhere is packed with stories about cheating in school and at university.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are cases where teachers give their students their own test answers, only themselves to look good in their reports.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mentors, who should teach otherwise, send the message that lying and deception is acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How many scams have come across?</seg>
<seg id="14">Studies show that in a single day Zalze somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.</seg>
<seg id="15">Suppose that many of them are the merciful lie.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that strangers during the first ten minutes of the first meeting he lied three times in my life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Determination of lies, or &quot;lie detection&quot; is an essential skill that should make everyone learn, whether for personal or professional reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is not no party game that would be similar to, say, Charade, when a man shouts &quot;Gotcha&quot;. Detection of deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities in the detailed research projects, especially in psychology and philosophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One result of this research is that most of the old myths about the lie was refuted.</seg>
<seg id="20">Liars will still look into his eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">It&#39;s not that they are stumbled, stammered, blushing or fidgeted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">But not up to the fact that it is somehow difficult to detect a liar and boots.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trained lies identifier can reveal the truth of sentence structure, small facial features, mode of formation of questions and their timing.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years collecting extensive scientific knowledge and developing the sector regarding the detection of lies and it is clear that detecting deception is an advanced skill that is easy to learn in today&#39;s complex world, you can greatly help - especially if one of your responsibilities include recruitment, organizing interviews, negotiating or leadership.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Good liars are able to read well in the other, let&#39;s let his guard down, directing their emotions and intuitively aware of how the other party accepts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">From research we know that extroverts lie more than introverts, pronouncing that men more &quot;self-centered&quot; lies, while women tell more lies &quot;aimed at other&quot; - largely to protect someone&#39;s feelings - that married people were lying to their partners less often than single people (of course, lies that say most are &quot;outrageous&quot;).</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when you lie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How do you know that someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is called &quot;initial observations&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="31">With him will later identify with what to compare.</seg>
<seg id="32">Notice the body posture, his laughter, with the voice work.</seg>
<seg id="33">You should know if anyone ever routinely pats down to wrongly accuse him of lying just because you start patting through meetings feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="35">Think of it but only as warning signals, not as proof of lies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People may stop uttering false move upper body when trying to recall his fanciful story, can make toes to the door, lean to the east, significantly change the posture or evince &quot;relief after the conversation&quot; - exaggerated Sighs of relief and change position when the confession is difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="37">People conducting interviews often issue false signal that the interview is over, just to see how it will look like a relief after his termination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Feel the body language.</seg>
<seg id="39">Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson přeřekl once and used the past tense when he claimed that his murdered wife is alive, which ran nationwide search for her body.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">A controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat emerged delay approval of the U.S. Government</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Several days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which he played off against each other unions, environmentalists, but calmed down - a company with the construction of pipelines in charge announced that it is willing to redirect the project so that they can be things in motion again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The company on Monday evening, TransCanada announced that it moves the planned route of pipeline ecologically sensitive areas in the Nebraska Sandhills, and believes that the project will still be approved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of Nebraska government.</seg>
<seg id="5">Representatives of TransCanada Pourbax Alex says that the company is confident that the pipeline construction will eventually be approved, even though another route leads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This announcement came after the Foreign Ministry last week announced that it is postponing a decision on federal approval of the project, where does not study the possible alternative routes through which it would be possible not to intervene in the Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground reservoir of water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">&quot;This is really moving forward,&quot; said Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">A new environmental report commissioned by the State Department would probably postponed any decision until the year 2013, one year after the elections next year, but the authorities deny that the decision would play a role in politics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama in a written statement last week described the decision as required by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed their support for him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">1700 miles long pipeline will connect the Gulf of Mexico and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">From Alberta to refineries in Texas by a day flow through 700,000 barrels of oil.</seg>
<seg id="12">This way will be cut through 6 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This project absolutely hate environmentalists, but he loved the work crew, which estimates that the pipeline will work on 20,000 new jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Legislators in Nebraska, however, stood against the plan and consider the introduction of laws that would have forced the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Existing studies on the environmental impact, commissioned by the State Department found that the project will have only a small negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry said the inspector general of the Ministry ordered a new review process of the original study, and focused mainly on two questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One was whether TransCanada lobbyist hired by the company, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser in 2008, Hillary Clinton, did not constitute a conflict of interest in the program.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other then that the company that was hired to conduct the original study, was chosen inappropriately, because she had ties to the company TransCanada.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian president, introduced him to a new government that will face a crisis that holds this country on the brink of economic disaster, which put into danger the whole eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The presidential palace issued a report that said that Monti, appointed on Sunday, on Wednesday will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano, confirmed to him that he could form a government.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected that the present government composed largely of technocrats, although still not yet clear when the new government takes power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said that the president will present the results of their talks that led to political parties in an effort to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">&quot;I confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult period,&quot; said the former European Commissioner reporters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti said explicitly that it could form a government, but the tone of his comments suggest that the obstacles are overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">&quot;The framework is now well defined,&quot; he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, at a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against political and financial crisis, due to the amount of the debt climbed to unsustainable levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti has approved tough austerity measures required by European leaders. The only way to restore battered credibility of Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Monti is a lot of pressure to hurry. Due to market volatility exceeded the interest from the Italian BTP bond with a maturity of ten years of 7 percent threshold level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confindustria employers&#39; organization, told reporters after meeting with Monti: &quot;We have said that this government will support a&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance to get to Italy from the burning situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Monti hopes of success are greatly multiplied with the support of the PDL Silvio Berlusconi, the crisis which forced the resignation on Saturday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">&quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti is destined to good results,&quot; she told reporters Angelina Alfano, Secretary of center-right parties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">PDL Support, the largest Italian parties is significant because up until this point, many of its members opposed to the technocratic government majority, which compiles Monti.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Support for Parliament</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Monti&#39;s new government must have strong support from Parliament in order to promote efficient unpopular reforms.</seg>
<seg id="20">Any obstacle or delay in the effort could bring a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure and warns that failure Monti could mean disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began on Monday dealing with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organizations and women.</seg>
<seg id="23">Round ends on Tuesday night.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed by President Napolitano on Sunday, allowing the reaction to the crisis very fast process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief decline in the late last week when it was already clear that Berlusconi submitted his resignation, the interest of Italian bonds returned to a critical threshold and respond to the uncertainty whether the new prime minister will reap success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Save Italy, where public debt is estimated at € 1.8 trillion, would be beyond the capabilities of the current financial reserves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said that the government should stand in power until the next elections are scheduled for 2013, despite the general assumption that the claim that politicians only give him the time in which to carry out reforms, and then announce early elections .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would like to incorporate the policy of his cabinet, but the major parties insist that the government must be composed only of professionals to lead Italy out of trouble into which the country came because of financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate government and political figures.</seg>

<seg id="7">This day will perform at 19:30 at the National Stadium with the angelic group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This is an excerpt from the interview, the entire transcript, visit La Nacion on the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For your Costa Rican fans is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Journey to Costa Rica is our dream that becomes reality.</seg>
<seg id="11">In South and Central America and the second time we have hardly been a great experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was in Costa Rica only once, on holiday. It&#39;s a beautiful country and I believe that we can stay a few days.</seg>
<seg id="13">So we are very happy that we can bring our music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask, because this group literally love the fans experience these days of preparation very intensively.</seg>
<seg id="15">What do you think your fans nejskalnějším?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you for standing by us so many years.</seg>
<seg id="17">It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry that it took us so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">This raises the more pressure you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve performed over the past 21 years, occurred within a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We showed some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact at that concert too excited.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we serfujeme, we like the jungle. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">As you know Costa Rica and its convenient to surf waves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have lots of friends and surfers have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. Local waves are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learn about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Looking at your tour, you put a great show with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What you have planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Given that we&#39;ve never played, we have no limit to what we could do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to showcase the best variety show with songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and varied repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine albums, and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose what songs we play every night.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we are in the repertoire of two or three songs we played a long time, we concentrate on them and we are surprised because we remember why we liked and so that we may have forgotten it.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is interesting for us to show, so I think it is more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This tour celebrating 20 years of artistic career.</seg>
<seg id="37">If you look back, it&#39;s hard to believe everything you could?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="39">First, I think none of us could not imagine that we will be in one big rock band and that it remains more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We realize how much was given to us and moves us, that we can continue to play together.</seg>
<seg id="41">We love and love we create music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are fortunate that we can look at places over which we have always dreamed of.</seg>
<seg id="43">We could do better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What you meant that you were an important part of the genre of grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Always it was an honor for us that we can be part of this group in which all these were men giants are represented.</seg>
<seg id="46">People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.</seg>
<seg id="47">Surprisingly, when the movement arises from a group of friends, very often it does not happen.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time arise in the group, but is much less common that one of the city came at a time five to ten groups.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud of it and we are honored to be part of a group from Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes we play with some more.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we saw on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very unusual for a group like yours and had remained together even after all these years still the same members.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, we four together for 21 years, Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a time much longer than normal duration of the group.</seg>
<seg id="54">I think first we all lucky that we are still in this world and, secondly, a role played by the fact that they are always interested in each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all close friends and because we managed to open a musical journey that everyone leave sufficient freedom for their own experimentation.</seg>
<seg id="56">We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the second and I think that it could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, due to your success, you can do whatever you like.</seg>
<seg id="58">How are balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we grew, it was gradually becoming easier to find the balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are too nejezdit on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap and crowds of people who love our music.</seg>
<seg id="61">When you realize that people come for the music, remember that you have music and what you gave it, respect it. You must not get carried away by the fact that you&#39;re famous, rock star. This is not one of us never really cared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How do you remember the next project, Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think we wrote great songs and it was at the beginning of something spectacular.</seg>
<seg id="64">As a band we have existed for three years and we have never published any album after he died Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most important is that even today been friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us. When you hear a song or look at photos, I remember Andy, as incredible as I laughed with him. It always was a joy to work with him, laugh, talk about music or about football and much more.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an incredible person and we are missing too.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">National band Las Robertas will be given the task to launch the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose a support slot?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, we sent a video production with a few suggestions this group and we liked the most. Therefore, we wonder what the Las Robertas offer live and be very entertaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why do they always change the words live Yellow Ledbetter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">It is a question to Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings it and I think that adds the first thing he can think of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Who influenced you as a bassist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">A lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="75">My first attack Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many that I could talk all night about bassists who I like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How did Pearl Jam grunge maintain, though no longer in vogue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think we all felt always easily separated from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When you say grunge, imagine a group of which I alluded as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others, which formed at the same time. And if you still like this music is valid, then it is something great, because it is the music worth listening to bands like Mudhoney and play better music now than ever before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the beginning of your music had a slightly sinister character and is now more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">What is behind this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">That&#39;s interesting, because I feel that the new album a couple of songs that are lighter-style, but also there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered to be very bleak, although they may send a signal to be positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">For both, when I played the Ed, I wept, and it is deeply obscure songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think when you&#39;re growing up and some trauma in your life, you lose someone from the family or friend, these things will influence your art and music and these two songs for me are just that.</seg>
<seg id="85">I also think that you can be a happy man, and although making gloomy music.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Super Mario has more than 25 years tirelessly fights to save Princess Peach from the clutches of evil Bowser, yet we will never appear in 3D: the &quot;Super Mario Land 3D&quot; will fight for love girls with stereoscopic technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The title, which is coming this month to all the shops around the world, was formed from the beginning to take advantage of all features offered by portable console Nintendo 3DS, which allows three-dimensional game play without having to use glasses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">&quot;Mario is a character who has to tell you how it should operate without stereoscopic glasses,&quot; said a worker at Nintendo specialist newspapers in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during a video presentation in Madrid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Alvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier,&quot; because until now successful movies like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the 3D film, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;available&quot; video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Álvarez confirmed that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; includes two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot;, whose task is to attract less skilled users.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once you get over this level, you can go to the &quot;second round&quot; games at levels that are time consuming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, users can choose between real time &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the event. But it will be playing in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and &quot;succumb optical deceptions.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new onset of Super Mario in 3D is also expected to return figures on a portable console, which occurred since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this video game Nintendo is playing into the hands of those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula of previous episodes. Lies in the fact that the bearded man plumber will have to undergo dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Although the player finds the news in the movements in the neighborhood, and also disguises the enemy, you are also a &quot;playful&quot; Luigi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Architects met on the occasion of opening a procedure that entails more than the controversy regarding fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">City tender for 16 gates again open debate on the role Collserola Park in Barcelona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid 80 years, during the heyday of defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the government printed several pamphlets in support of the park Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mountain Flyer defined as a large metropolitan park of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">What&#39;s more, he was accompanied by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the lapse in 1987, CMB, Park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is indeed one of the few, not aimed at the axis of north - south, but up (mountain) - Down (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">Qualification as a natural park Collserola goes in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reference has already been Central Park, but with a wild boar instead of Yellowstone Yogi Bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such was the position until September, when the Hall announced a competition consisting of 16 mega auditions for the same number of gateways to Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gateway, of course, favors the idea of ​​the park.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or someone trying to put the gate into the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question is therefore the only question Collserola, park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">During the competition, both for purely organizational, and on the basis of reflection on the city, this question becomes a central theme of all the Barcelona architects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It&#39;s been just wiped topic, as when two members of the old caste chosen at a meeting in the elevator shake hands.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this act provoked one of the rare matches between what they think three barcelonští předstoupivší architects and university professors.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modolo Bayona and Martha: the selection procedure is justified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to Roldan, after the Gulf now giving thought to the question, &quot;should&quot; discuss about &quot;mountain side&quot; so Ildefonso Cerda expression of green apples was not tightened to the end.</seg>
<seg id="19">&quot;We start from the principle that the most extensive park is the Barcelona beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, its great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, &quot;said the architect, for which the name&quot; Gateway to Collserola &quot;carries&quot; lexikologickou trap &quot;: we can not be present&quot; as the entrances to the park, but rather as defining the areas where it can cause. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modolo, as Roldán and Bayona with experience from the world of urban design qualifies as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; providing at &quot;some risk&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="23">Risks due to &quot;uncertainty, we now project a public place&quot; after the experience of the 80 years, the Forum had &quot;his swan song.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="24">The first concern is the very definition of the borders, where it should be built.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;Something has to do is to define the next step&quot;, that is, in principle, move a step further.</seg>
<seg id="26">&quot;It should be borne in mind and new urban planning tools because they present (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">If we focus in detail on the question Modolo believes that the valley slope Collserola can be &quot;considered as a park,&quot; but not part of Barcelona, ​​for reasons purely topographical.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modolo also reminded that there is already work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which &quot;may not end up on the scrap heap,&quot; even though welcomes the fact that Hall offers his council that the project reaches the &quot;first time&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="29">And it understands that the proximity of mountains and the city is kind of a pass that allows architects to engage in debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; that it should be just this technical profile, leading multidisciplinary teams (&quot;it&#39;s all about skills,&quot; supplies) to be a &quot;Architects should only be a tool.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, which gave the name of this game is complex, because in the tender documentation for missing Collserola global vision: &quot;It was announced 16 procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies which looked at the area and understand it as a whole. &quot;</seg>
<seg id="31">This means that at least he is enrolled in all 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the project is one of the gates can run into the concept and definition of the architect neighboring gate.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, the Town Hall should ensure that the zone is located immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the zone equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and greenery.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity, and traced to Mexican children and young people at risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the occasion of International Day of diabetes, which is celebrated on 14th November, he reminded that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for application-specific questionnaires regarding nutrition.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">He said that one reason for the search parameters is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations of their genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He informed that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetics, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes responsible for diabetes and obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained that, in general genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy they consume (calories), which is stored as fat.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">The Asphalt from UNAM are not potholes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty of UNAM produces polymer modified asphalt, creating a blend having improved functionality, regardless of weather conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If properly cared for paving, it would be nearly 200 thousand to repair potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan area of ​​Valle de Mexico, Najera pointed Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) from UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction in erosion, or it could even be completely removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his lecture Technological cause erosion, which said the International Year of Chemistry, has announced that the laboratory under the direction of developing modified bitumen with polymers, which should emerge from a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but greater mechanical strength, both at low and at high temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Najera Herrera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in areas with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt, the hardest part of petroleum hydrocarbons is a group of molecules, molecules with high molecular weight, called asphaltene, and other low molecular weight, called Malten. Together they give the typical viscoelastic nature of asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Viscoelastic nature of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures around 180 degrees, acts as a liquid at 120 degrees has a high viscosity at 50 degrees and is nearly in solid form, while at low temperature asphalt has a tendency to break, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but varies during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, noted expert in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Faculty of Chemical Scientist observed that most streets in Mexico City is covered with a flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the layers is nejsvrchnějšími asphalt liner, consisting of small stones embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He stressed that every stone that forms the cartridge is sealed with asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">While driving cars or creating pressure, it is possible to force a well-spread on the pavement.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it was modified asphalt, spread would be even better, it feels a chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">He added that the asphalt pad is placed last layer called the mantle, consisting of soft rock, sand is also embedded in the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given that this layer will come into contact with the wheels of vehicles, must have greater mechanical strength than asphalt liner and must provide a friction surface.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Given that as part of pavement will be exposed to heavy load, it must have sufficient thickness and mantle must be careful of the material from which it is made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Climate, particularly moisture and temperature changes are also very important factor to bear in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of asphalt pads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it&#39;s hard to get out, it causes a softening of all pavement layers thereby creating potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">He explained that during the creation of potholes, as the first film deals damage to tires and then there is damage to the asphalt pads. The damage but not in one moment, but it is a gradual process, which should no longer stop at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a member of the National System of scientists also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each layer corresponds to the plateau musí paving vehicle and must ensure that the load exceeds this. Only then can we prevent frequent creation of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera pointed out that in terms of asphalt, we will have a lot of work and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning for example, asphalt emulsion, which in other countries are already available on the market and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use a high temperature.</seg>

<seg id="1">What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Serna Melina Ramirez did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle obtains 14th title of first runner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Valle del Cauca again reached the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Serna Melina Ramirez had to be content with the fact that she was on stage winners, won a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which became the new first runner-up Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Based on the results of yesterday&#39;s final in Cartagena, where she won and took the scepter Miss Atlántico, said the department received 14th title of first runner. Melina joins a multitude of women of Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of winning the crown, but eventually were declared first runner-up. These include Miriam Benoit Ospina (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Bellini Patricia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanqui (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuelo Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The question that many ask. What was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">The result is a defeat is a great favorite, which in all previous rounds has shown that it has to become the new Miss Colombia and not in vain became Queen of the police and the nicest tváří Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached such as Italians or Vargas Natalia Navarro, which subsequently won the title of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury has decided to appoint her only first runner-up, is that not convinced by his answer to the question: &quot;Which book did you like best and why?&quot; Which laid the Murillo Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The candidate answered the question:</seg>
<seg id="11">&quot;I read a lot. Very believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms zkulturňování. Book that most influenced me as a child, was&quot; The Little Prince &quot;, a very deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently reading &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot; It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature which we should all know. And today I bring a book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. This is a wonderful book called &quot;El Ardor de la sangre&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This answer did not like both because the term &quot;culturize&quot; and secondly, because the candidate did not explain what she referred to various books marked.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the ceremony Melina stated that it is quiet and has a happy outcome: &quot;The world is wise, what happens, happens.</seg>
<seg id="15">And you people read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">An additional hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bogotský journalist suggested that the candidate was from the beginning of the most popular, most celebrated and one that took away all previous price (Oster culinary challenge, the title of public art for the best dresses and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, vystresovalo queen, who then on the scene fail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It was apparent at the first presentation of swimwear on the beach and the Hilton during the final two shows before the coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although both shone, it was obvious that she lacked the strength and fervor that showed athletes from Atlantico and Magdalena.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the &quot;at home&quot; on Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda was named first runner-up confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most during the competition titles eventually leaves the Queen with a crown. &quot;</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, in recent days Valle took the rather unfriendly attitude toward the media and he will not pay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which are the basis of national beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just on the edge, two days before choosing an international jury member Lucy Doughty said they are looking for a woman who is aware of the social needs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">&quot;In the Miss Colombia beauty alone is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social awareness. It is important that candidates before they enter the competition, have been involved in such projects,&quot; explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">He also speculates about the fact that candidate Valle lost points because of weaknesses in their background and fibrosis, which was evident in the abdomen. It is entirely inconsistent with the jury verdict, which it chose Miss &quot;natural beauty&quot; for healthy body, proper nutrition and physical activity, accountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the Queen, recognizing that Melina had the best body, that there were more girls, &quot;but problems with fibrosis of the abdomen, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, she stepped down points on the last day.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos Cromos magazine believes that the native of Valle made a mistake when he underwent several surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="28">&quot;Surgical intervention is in order, but they failed to Valle.</seg>
<seg id="29">The body has never been her forte, and here took its toll. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this award, the first National Assembly conferring beauty in a swimsuit after the show there was a cruel prediction that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina indulged that it eventually had to give the highest crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether it&#39;s true or not, it is certain that Melina today launched the year of his reign, not as a queen, a princess from a position that gives her the chance to represent Colombia at various international competitions, which will be named itself the National competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, recorded in history as one of the queens, which, despite success in Cartagena strhujícímu the highest crown or another.</seg>

<seg id="1">Such was the work of Cali residents, who identified the corpse Alfons Cana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">An expert on fingerprints from Cali came into history as the man who confirmed the death, &quot;Alfonso Cana.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these officials is crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">4th November last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC, &quot;Alphonse Cana&quot;, through the comparison of fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who work at the Department of CTI, this week was the turn of Eliazar Gonzalez, the men of Puerto Tejada, who 21 years working in the field of legal research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, González has worked at City Hall in Choco, where they often had more than five days way through the forest to get to the place where the corpse, which had to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after graduating from the courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science is the study of skin friction, ie palms of hands and feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In the week when the operation was carried out against that Alfons Canova, Eliazar said to have brought his clothes at least three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Expected something big.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Friday night went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspects that one of them is the man who led a guerrilla oldest in the world. Therefore requested to take his card with fingerprints Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when the investigating team arrived at the place where the corpse was located, did not recognize him because of physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">He had no beard, was dressed as a peasant in the field, without glasses, much slimmer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But fingerprints do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Along with Galton magnifier, ink and light transplantátorem Eliazar daktylové began to compare records with records from corpses card.</seg>
<seg id="16">The eye it did not disappoint: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That same night a man originally from Puerto Tejada was charged with the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirmed that indeed was the supreme commander of the FARC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Stop Searching</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For daktyloskopa of Sijín de Cali is recognized that Eliazar Gonzalez showed President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference, operational services against the &quot;Canova&quot; very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people know our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">Fingerprints is an exact science, no possibility of error that can play a key role in deciding crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In addition to identifying corpses to help these people in the research of crimes such as theft or murder, and confirm the identity of trapped persons.</seg>
<seg id="23">When caught, offenders presents a lot of false papers or no papers at all.</seg>
<seg id="24">We take from them and look for fingerprints in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The investigator said that in case of injury, had the house to remove the piece of the wall of the house, because at this point is leaning against a thief, that he a safe full of jewelry and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The walls are difficult because they are not intended to take fingerprints, but in this case, we can get the whole impression of the hand and identify the offender, who was involved in several thefts, &quot;he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Fingerprints can also confirm or refute the suspicion of the murder.</seg>
<seg id="28">Not long ago a man found dead with bottles of alcohol around.</seg>
<seg id="29">Based on the investigation it was found that the murder could be one of the responsible family members and the imprint on the bottle is really confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although not absolutely confirm that was indeed the murderer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">An expert on fingerprints from CTI explained that the fingerprints of the subjects&#39; blurred using reactive chemical or physical agents. &quot;</seg>
<seg id="32">When observed, they are used for their removal or tape transplantátor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Fingerprints are then sent to Asif, a database of offenders, or file cabinets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">&quot;The problem is that currently there are still many Colombians, whose details are not recorded anywhere,&quot; said an expert from CTI.</seg>
<seg id="35">He explained that not everything is as it appears on the television program CSI.</seg>
<seg id="36">Like everything that glitters is not gold, not all of what you touch, traces remain.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, if it can be used, it must make the appropriate comparisons.</seg>

<seg id="3">Since March last year, Japan&#39;s economy was paralyzed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face since 2 World War II.</seg>

<seg id="5">After three quarters of GDP, the value falls between July and September in a position that it was possible to definitively turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and 6% a year.</seg>

<seg id="6">Results of the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - and expect the greatest growth rate in comparison with January-March period of the 2010th</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery, which are necessary for the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending drops by 0.9% compared to January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.</seg>

<seg id="9">However, the true awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on impulse, which makes use crisis for us to come out stronger from it, or to rehabilitate infrastructure. It&#39;s about the lack of benefit to us to start from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan has awakened. In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.</seg>
<seg id="11">This variable is increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.</seg>

<seg id="14">With a stronger currency products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of major technology groups.</seg>

<seg id="1">CDU proposes to elect a European president by universal suffrage</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Without serious problems for Chancellor and Christian Democratic Party chairwoman Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).</seg>
<seg id="3">The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the program, but it has to fall, especially to be satisfied with party members who believe that government policy towards Greeks today and maybe tomorrow against the Italians as lax.</seg>
<seg id="4">The proposal on the President of the European Commission handed leadership was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only nine out of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Few minutes of standing ovation at the end of Merkel&#39;s speech and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, a very pro-European finance minister, did not leave room for doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main idea of ​​Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up: the answer to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe means peace, but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">According to the Chancellor in Europe &quot;time has come for change.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="10">This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty enabling the EU to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of member countries euro area, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage &quot;in order to give Europe a face&quot;.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is in each case one of the ideas adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is certainly not unlikely that all twenty seven countries in this revolutionary step quick agrees: against the State of Great Britain and the leaders of the CDU holds that same position taken also Nicolas Sarkozy.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the direction is defined.</seg>
<seg id="14">Similarly, the large majority of delegates rejected a proposal to assess each country&#39;s weight in the Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of its economy, which obviously results in a strengthening of Germany&#39;s weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Driven by concerns to appease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But did not try to get Congress talk of &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the proposal on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel, France did not quote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only indirectly.</seg>
<seg id="18">When reminded that it was two centuries ago took place at Leipzig bloody battle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact it was one of the most humiliating defeats Napoleon&#39;s army.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">What constitutes fraud in the incapacity?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After UMP party supports trigger and the government offensive against the working incapacity.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux and visit the office for the provision of social support, which delivers the speech on the subject of recurring since 2007 on combating fraud and redistribution of social solidarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">As an accompaniment to this offensive, based on savings will implement in the context of increased rigor, but is no less clear in terms of right-wing presidential campaign, most right-wing wants to focus on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity before they take support in the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Clearly, without the consent of the company employee who becomes ill, has lost four days wages, at least 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">The measures, which risks causing many bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos sheet could bring 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the measure, which would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic hand: to give public employees not covered by one day sick leave (up to now have no failure over three days in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these issues are discussed, also runs the most right-wing fraud theme this time focused on the abuses linked to work disability.</seg>
<seg id="10">&quot;Checks will be much broader and more: if you get caught, you pay back,&quot; noted Xavier Bertrand in an interview with RTL on Sunday 13 of November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Like in other cases, the effects seem to notice a somewhat disproportionate to the truth about the injustices of sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="12">These were in fact under constant surveillance since 2002 and political onslaught that brought fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are more ill than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Let&#39;s first of several official figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Caisse nationale d&#39;assurance maladie (cname - the national health insurance) was paid in 2006, more than 237 million euros daily allowance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the health sector in 2008 accounted for per diem with its 11.3 billion euro 5% of health expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount 46% of parent contributions and related occupational injuries and 54% were for sick leave, ie € 6.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus, only 2.5% of the cost of health care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">According to a study group Alma Consulting had the French in 2010 averaged 14.5 days vs 17.8 sick leave days in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="20">Average, which conceals a variation: another poll published in 2007 on the site dealing with jobs Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they did not select any day of incapacity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time made by health insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of sick leave was shorter than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 within three months and 11% lasted longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When compared with their European neighbors, the French workers are more prone than others to work incapacity.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long study conducted in 2010, two mA researchers CNRS (National Research Center) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (health reasons or not) in France oscillated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Cheating for sick leave is only a very small part compared to the work on black.</seg>
<seg id="25">With regard to fraud, these are only minor.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strengthening of legislation since 2002 meant that there are systematic inspections focusing on sick leave longer than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, CNAME noted that the 1.5 million checks were 13.8% of the 285,000 made for short-term disability &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, ie 37,050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the event of failure to systematically controlled more than 45 days are counted 11% of cases &quot;nepřizpůsobených or unauthorized&quot; checks to 1.2 million, ie 132 000th</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">A total of 169,000 &quot;irregular&quot; cases for several million workers who had a disability.</seg>
<seg id="30">A number that is much less than the number expressing the work on black.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to Deputy Dominique Tiana UMP, author of the June report on this issue, this number would be represented 9 až € 15 billion in missing tax revenue per year, more than the total amount of daily compensation and therefore infinitely more than the fraud associated with the last mentioned.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says expert committee</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the report of the Royal Canadian society is denied the death of Canadians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the case of palliative care committee urgently requires that governments, institutions and health care physicians working together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Canadian society is the idea of ​​denying death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of Canadians actually accepts the opportunity to talk with your doctor about conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report of the Royal Canadian company, with the participation of six experts working in various areas, including the ethics, law and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The committee recommends the government to change the criminal law so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, it appears if this option is exercised in a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">At the beginning of experts cite a recent independent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries across the planet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada is ranked 10th place, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada gave birth to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medicalization of yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, communicated to us by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian society.</seg>
<seg id="11">And over the desire to die at home, which most Canadians, 68.6% of them dying in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">This average applies across Canada, while Quebec is the highest number with 86% of deaths in hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With regard to the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report authors arrive at conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has said that the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide will not change anything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">According to experts, who also underwent control all the countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that this causes some odkriminalizování abuse in the application, ie the practice of euthanasia and assisted suicide do not have jurisdiction to persons or disagreeing.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference over numerous cases of these missteps just in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">&quot;Euthanasia is performed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Canadians are supportive of euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Recall that according to surveys conducted Angus Reid Forum in 2010 to 85% of Canadians have called for euthanasia because they believe that allowing people to end life, relieve their suffering.</seg>
<seg id="20">A 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we send the message that the life of old or disabled people have lower price.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for persons who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those questioned believe that should not be prosecuted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Concerning the maintenance or disruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also in the list of their recommendations suggest that in criminal law states that the withdrawal of treatment for which there is a legally confirmed rejection, is not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="24">Commission experts also requires that medical specialists have been educated to respect the obligation to refuse medical treatment at the end of life without that fear of criminal prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In the case of palliative care committee urgently requires that governments, institutions and health care physicians working together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, in the case of palliative or definitive palliation already widely used in Canadian health care facilities requires the Commission to be considered when no longer used to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and that subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Reservations of the other experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some medical experts have the right to express our reservations regarding the conclusions of expert reports of the Royal Canadian society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified as experts-signatories of the report as &quot;extreme&quot; among other things, restrict the practice of euthanasia on the sick in the final stage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">&quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone would be tired of life, which should more than 18 years, could ask to help him commit suicide,&quot; said Pierre Deschamps, who last studied the report summaries.</seg>
<seg id="31">P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report opposed the autonomy of persons over all other values ​​that shape the social fabric of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">For &quot;the company says there are warning signs and restrictions.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialist medical law Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which it characterized as a&quot; manifesto for euthanasia. &quot;</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian society, especially doubts about the data report on the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, ie in the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">If there is an issue that can not be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or the emotions, it&#39;s energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Availability and price of electricity has a direct impact on purchasing power and competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is natural that the election meeting was an opportunity to think about such deposits, and the place that takes energy from the core.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will be successful only if all explore the economic, social and environmental consequences of proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must establish its position on objective facts and rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile on the planet&#39;s seven billion human beings, but from now on demographic causes doubling by 2050 demand for electricity, if we do not want much of the world population to get rid of an important part of life.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time will be faced scarcity of fossil resources, in order to continue to produce electricity, and it can not forget the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, a theme that is currently disappearing from the environmental debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The accident in Fukušimě does not affect any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="12">But this is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which considers only the right to build power plants last generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote a few countries, with a determination to continue in their projects.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States has for Fukušimě decided to expand its fleet by one unit restoring a power plant construction suspended after the accident of Three Mile Island power plant.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model based on renewable energies, sometimes presented as an example that contradicts reality.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin to show increase in the cost of electricity prices, increased energy dependency on imported gas from Russia in particular, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by construction of power plants to natural gas and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark deserves to think over it.</seg>
<seg id="19">European champion in the wind, which removes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of irregularities in the wind, making the emissions of CO2 and the Danish electricity prices increased by 65%, respectively. 50%, than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors to pay electricity bills by 40% higher than the payment amounts to French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in the globalized economy, energy costs are a key factor in maintaining competitiveness and security industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would create a strong increase in electricity prices that would make a beautiful statement of illusory re-industrialization of our country and defend the purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The price that a large majority of the French refused to pay, as well as in principle not opposed to this energy, as shown by opinion polls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Recall that our country&#39;s energy policy has enabled the industry to build 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 related jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Strong exporting industry for dragging on the international markets a large number of specialized small and medium enterprises that generate jobs, which can not be transferred abroad.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France has decided to leave the core, sacrificed by a considerable number of small and medium enterprises and came to 6 billion per year that the country receives for exports of nuclear equipment and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">Which owner ordered power plants to nuclear reactor designed to operate 60 years, while it was scheduled to decline by its manufacturer?</seg>
<seg id="28">In solving the energy equation must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, and even that there is not no devil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Development of facilities producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear power plants and renewable sources of energy carried by the French industrial group AREVA suggests complementarity of energy sources.</seg>
<seg id="30">If nuclear power is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which performs rigorous and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new power plant in Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams whose professionalism is recognized, they have the idea of ​​safety in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="33">For fifty years the nuclear industry saw three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only in the Three Mile Island occurred in conditions of normal operation and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">The drama caused by the Chernobyl reactor design and inexcusable human error.</seg>
<seg id="36">For Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nuclear industry takes lessons from this accident, just as it did in the previous two.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The fruit of this step and cooperation between French and German authorities, dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the EPR type reactor concept is capable of withstanding such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While all candidates who wish to build a nuclear power plant, to consider it, stop its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered by competitors Areva and EDF&#39;s release and travel to seize the leading position in nuclear development.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is necessary and legitimate search for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, and the machinations of dogma dominated the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.</seg>

<seg id="3">Recently it has been the administrative harassment, which were the subject of foreign students, which has become current, when the Minister of the Interior (see list of Libération, 23 May) said that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waitresses.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="4">But so far only rarely been analyzed under the angle of the economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Needless to say, that in this area are fairly broad consensus between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">To the right tone in 1976 Jacques Chirac gave his statement that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers&quot; and Michel Rocard on the left, when in 1990 he said that France &quot;can not receive all the misery of the world &quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, the fear of invasion hordes of Polish plumbers to French territory shared by right and left.</seg>
<seg id="9">In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that uráčíme immigrants provide.</seg>
<seg id="11">In his program, François Hollande limited to banalities, he indicates that the joint development will solve our &quot;immigration problem&quot;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of ​​immigration as a burden and a problem in the elections are possible, but economically it is very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">How reminiscent of economists, Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published work syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): among specialists there is broad consensus on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Limiting immigration paralyzes growth and harms employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Concerns about the impacts of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create downward pressure on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more than adding replacements for French workers, by working in the sectors with a lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that attracted the French workers, and those skilled in the most dynamic sectors in which the offer is not enough training places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Like the surgeon will be able to work in a country where lack of anesthetists, the addition of French migrants and cause the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri so calculated that the increase in migratory movements of 1% causes a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And it does not take into account the fact that immigrants bringing diversity contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants in the American Nobel Prize winners, Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were established immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Migrants are also in European countries, net contributor of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">World Labour Organisation estimates the instance that an immigrant in Germany came at the age of 30 years will bring your entire life to public budgets net contribution (revenue minus expenses) € 150,000.</seg>

<seg id="13">&quot;It&#39;s progress, but it should certainly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;But it&#39;s possible.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;We know for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support, and that manifests itself more and more actively,&quot; moderates statements Nigerian Kunle Amuwo investigator.</seg>

<seg id="2">In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel to help Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplifying and ignorance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">America can manage crises weakened the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?</seg>
<seg id="4">While listening to the presidential candidates would have voters think.</seg>
<seg id="5">For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other repeated loud statements and concise guidance on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or Israel to help blend with each other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, umisťující best candidate in the race for the Republican nomination &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, threatened the Chinese occupation before the World Trade Organisation and the charges &quot;because of their currency manipulation,&quot; which is the main topic in America turbulent migration of whole sections of industry towards Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even worse, if this in itself must contain start a trade war, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, Obama&#39;s former ambassador to China, and the only candidate having a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, nearly caught in the position to be &quot;smoothed&quot; emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">It required tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current stance of President Obama).</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of estimates in the election remains neposlouchatelný.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The image of President Reagan</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;If I am elected, we confine Iran,&quot; said fanfarónsky.</seg>
<seg id="15">&quot;If re-elected, Obama will have a bomb.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="16">He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama that failed in their responsibilities towards the partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best umístivší candidate demonstrates an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently called for a sharp stance against China&#39;s military threat because Beijing &quot;trying to develop nuclear capability&quot; - evidently ignorant of the fact that China&#39;s own nuclear weapons since 1964!</seg>
<seg id="19">Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike against Iran, says of himself that he is ready to send U.S. forces into Mexico to fight drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="20">The use of torture against terrorists banned expected in Obama 2009 is also recommended Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are all much else than it was in 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Opponents say the current president that Reagan also had a simple idea and yet won the Cold War.</seg>
<seg id="23">They point out that Obama himself was an amateur and that added water to their wine in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">They emphasize the failure of the naive dialogue with Iran, hasty departure &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his excuses for him by Libya and attach the label weak</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">But the attack is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="26">Population review national security policy of President Obama, who removed the Ben Laden, rather positively.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nord Stream, a new input port of Russian gas to Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Remote Nord Stream pipeline directly linking Russia to Eastern Europe and driven by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must deliver gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government attended the inauguration last Tuesday Nord Stream, a new pipeline that connects directly beneath the sea, Russia and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned around together control the valve control input of Russian gas to western grid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">This new pipeline will begin to flow each year into Western Europe, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas pipe of the first 1,224 km connecting the region with the Land of St. Petersburg Mecklembursko-Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="8">The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, an amount equal to the entire French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">And already the third points to build gas pipelines on the same route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge character building victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Project strongly protested against Poland and the Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nord Stream will actually deliver gas directly to Germany without that would be handled by a third country after country (Poland or Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Suddenly, the two countries are losing a bit of power: the possibility of threats to put pressure on Russia to shut him access to Western markets for them becomes more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Warsaw&#39;s most strongly expressed, did not hesitate when compared to the Nord Stream &quot;new German-Soviet Pact&quot;, referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in The 1939th</seg>
<seg id="15">Does it say that it is politically sensitive topic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe by supporting this project in the Russian won him more confident of their purchases.</seg>
<seg id="17">But is this the price weakened Europe&#39;s energy, because the project created a rift between Europeans from the east and west.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia managed to barely 5 years ago to promote his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high consumption of gas, whose deposits are nearing the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">&quot;This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,&quot; Francois Fillon has confirmed at the ceremonial opening of the pipeline and demonstrated, at what point the gas contracts are big things both politically and economically.</seg>
<seg id="20">All this explains the wide smiles Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, place of supply of gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical offense.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bottom line is equipped with steel concrete casing to protect it from ships anchors.</seg>
<seg id="23">Rests on the seabed at an average depth of 200 m</seg>
<seg id="24">During its construction it was necessary to avoid the mine fields originating from the time of second World War II.</seg>
<seg id="25">&quot;For safety, they almost had to be removed or destroyed by the hundred,&quot; said Jens Mueller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It should also increase measures to protect fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The very long metal pipe like a snake weighing 242 Eiffelovek appropriated for its entire length is never interrupted or valves or stations of maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">One control platform should be built close to Sweden, but it rejected the project manager, when the Swedes were just a little eager to see the Russian state company, how to permanently settle in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">&quot;In case of failure stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute&quot;, states Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In case of leakage gas contained in gas escapes into the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is considered a builder unlikely, for welds was designed so that the leak was once in 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Check the status of the pipeline outside performs underwater robot driven organizations, while the interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.</seg>
<seg id="33">This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the interior of pipe and is pushed gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the finish after three days of travel speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information on any deformation of metal parts.</seg>
<seg id="35">Remote gas pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without the slightest need to fix.</seg>
<seg id="36">Gas circulation is simply to ensure pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">The value of this pressure is 200 bar and 100 bar starting at the finish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">For this project, five companies have joined forces.</seg>
<seg id="39">Leadership remains Gazprom, which holds 51% share.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him join the German company E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">The company is headquartered in Zoug in Switzerland, where tax is extremely convenient.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom then the company has leased for five years contract, which may be renewed, all of its capacity to transport gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">&quot;Gazprom will have a total capacity of profit, whatever the real amount of any of the gas,&quot; explains Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Financing construction of the pipeline to ensure 30% of the shareholders and 70% of bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For a group GDF Suez and investment costs have risen to 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But minority shareholders are sure that they return their costs, because risk takes only Gazprom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea coast on the sandy Lubmin with pine woods.</seg>
<seg id="50">The valves are 4.5 meters high gate output gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday the terminal receives an hourly one million cubic meters of Russian gas.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6000000.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why is such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Around 19% of disabled people seeking work.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today opens 15th Week for employing the handicapped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Through proactive public policy established in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons more times higher than the average, ie 19% versus 9% for the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="5">It&#39;s depressing?</seg>
<seg id="6">&quot;No, underscores Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, which organizes Week for employing the handicapped.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="7">&quot;Progress achieved in 15 years are remarkable.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="8">&quot;At that time the percentage of unemployed was not twice but three times.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="9">&quot;However, it remains much to do.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It should be noted that for unemployed disabled people are still numerous obstacles before they start work.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is an older person: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have few qualifications: 80% have high school diploma and 2.3 million university students is only 10 000 handicapped.</seg>
<seg id="13">And finally - long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% vs. 38% disabled in diameter.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, such are the criteria that are especially complicated by the return to work and who represent the &quot;core issue&quot;, according to Christian Grapina, CEO Tremplin Association, founded in 1992 to assist businesses to adopt handicapped workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So in terms of objective brakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Left unsaid, ways of thinking which will certainly evolve, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study conducted in April-IMS Entreprendre Association pour la Cité found that the respondents are managers&#39; poor level of knowledge about handicapped persons &quot;with&quot; an exaggerated image of persons in a wheelchair and psychological or mental deficiencies. &quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching that goal to employ handicapped workers 6% specified in the Act of 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last known numbers that come out of the year 2008, indicate the status equal to 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">&quot;Now is around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the organization responsible for collecting Agefiph fees from businesses that do not comply with this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof is the number of &quot;fined&quot; businesses, as well as the amount paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 the offending companies to 46,000 (from 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">&quot;Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="23">&quot;But this improvement and also demonstrates a real awareness, particularly in large enterprises.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Portugal very confident</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts with great optimism play-off tie against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the way there both teams lacked realism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">&quot;At the end of 90 minutes we will be happy team and happy above all the earth.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="5">Paulo Bento has already seen in Poland and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">For him there is no shadow of doubt. Portuguese football team with whose helm since 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">Portugal away from happiness, in fact, 90 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="8">It remains to play one game and one opponent - Bosnia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Being aware of Friday&#39;s outcome (0-0) in Zenica Bosnia hell, it seems clear that nothing is won.</seg>
<seg id="10">Portugal certainly had superiority over an hour, but was not able to give such a rare goal, which would relieve him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">&quot;It&#39;s a good result, which in itself carries a risk, however, because we did not give out Socket.&quot;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that the forward front of an audience that there was a boiling cauldron, although the game definitely seems to be &quot;very balanced,&quot; says an optimist, but shrewdly thinking Bento.</seg>
<seg id="13">&quot;We expect a very tight game, but we are quite confident that we can have the upper hand,&quot; said the Portuguese coach dvaačtyřicetiletý.</seg>
<seg id="14">&quot;We still have 50% chance to be at Euro 2012&quot;, but qualified the successor to Carlos Queiroz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Friday&#39;s tie game in Bosnia forced the Portuguese score goals and win.</seg>
<seg id="16">Undecided match may suffice Bosnians who also need to score goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">&quot;It&#39;s a good result, which in itself carries a risk, however, because we did not give out gola,&quot; regrets Bento.</seg>
<seg id="18">&quot;We are playing against a team that has great technical quality, which has players with great individual qualities,&quot; he added.</seg>
<seg id="19">As in Zenica will develop an interest in Portuguese Bosnian team right from the beginning of the maximum pressure to &quot;not give them time to think.&quot;</seg>
<seg id="20">Good idea, provided that this time turns out to be realistic.</seg>
