MEPs refused at second reading the draft amendment to the reduction of the sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the ex-Première Minister currently imprisoned.

<p>
<seg id="4">
tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for an agreement in principle disadvantageous with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December.

<seg id="6">
tymosenko calls the judgment of revenge policy of the regime and triggered a process of suspicions of bias of the court also to the west.

The project to annul paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the Minister ex-Premère was sentenced, was signed by 147 Members.

Libyan victory

The Interim National Council ruled the law of Sharia law and we already know what it is.

In Libya is such an order as we cannot represent and as we would surely not.

<seg id="11">
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be beneficial to the Libyan.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist warriors have accepted the aid with recognition of dogs infidels.

<seg id="13">
The only excuse is that this is not an American general who led the NATO strikes but Allah they celebrated the magnitude at each attack.

When it is to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not one

After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militarily Libya.

There are therefore no problem for the premises to be rid of "crusaders."

More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, 9% of écoliersont a weight above average and 5% are obese.

As the current research obese children come from families that unhealthy lifestyles.

The survey was conducted during the last school year and involved 900 primary school children in Czech Republic.

<seg id="10">
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not by chance," action supported by the general health and Unilever.

Since the beginning it is more than 12000 students from sixth to third who enrolled in this project.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children are overweight or obese, is the absence of adequate food and not enough exercise.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
"Only half the children interviewed indicated, for instance, eat 5 times per day déjeuner-en small cases - lunch - dinner goûter-, which is a basic principles of good food," says one of the results of the investigation.

<p>
<seg id="14">
Without breakfast and lunch at the deli

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes a few basic details such as a small lunch in family at the same time.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students "families eat at the same time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
In the majority of families each takes its breakfast alone.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
And the worst was identified that a tenth of the population does not at all.

<seg id="19">
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The survey showed that in the families of obese children are more often French fries unhealthy.

"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far away, in terms of a healthy diet, the ideal."

Among their favourite meals there is a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"The more alarming is a strong preference for the sweet lemonades," is indicated in the results of the investigation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

For lunch are the pulp who took place just before the first white meat.

The designer must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
In a presentation on how to learn for the designers, I started a little angry that there were many from the beginning.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
I didn't think about what would happen afterwards.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The presentations of three professionals of specialty, clothing characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
And it will be worse.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
As we approach the final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays that is truly "packed."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This time we have with the Director (Alenka over there is no boy) Treaty of how to dress the woman who has no measurements.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
And women of this type is the majority.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
One has a small neck, the other a boy, without special curve, another of overweight.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The designer must know how optically ammenuiser arms wide, extend a neck or add curves.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
We arrived and nicely to emphasise the character and also not to pay too showy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips and a size.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
If there is a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that skirts or pants are not at all, this is the time to do it.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And you won't regret it because clothing that is impeccably is invaluable.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than in the shifting coiled and does not take to the belt and so on.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Each student received a celebrity to pay for the day and the evening.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
We must take into account the current, the type of personality and appearance.

<p>
<seg id="21">
I will have to dress up Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know of the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
At the back of my mind, it gives me pleasure, because it is better to dress as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera which has taken almost a hundred kilograms in recent times (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
We must cut and sew from magazines or search the web, print and graphic design work.

<seg id="24">
The Moodboard, as they say on the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic design.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Also reflect on the part of the styling is also important.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The designer dresses is not only the physical but creates for example, the pages in the magazines (on products given the trends for purses, coats, etc.).
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Mario, such as designer and graphic artist, we had all this.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
But this,... Until Sunday
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
The designer must have a general vision
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Three guests of specialty have given a diverse aspect to the meeting on Saturday filled with information on the different types of characters.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka designer fashion and Ben Renc, photographer of fashion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to use.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
And a designer of talent to work with a single dress differently.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The variability is for this example.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
As for example, the coats that must be raised from classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but it can also pay the naked body, with pumps and the picture as a dress.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Or simply walk up the sleeves or the pass and immediately have a new look.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"Play with this," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules perfectly."
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"You can then start doing things," said Jakub.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Finally I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines is sometimes seen something else.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
No statement on the fashion shows.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer should have much more variants of clothing that are photographed.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
That is, for fashion story which will have a dozen pages (and therefore a dozen models) I have to be ready to "trimmed" at least a fortnight.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
And also, clothing and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
We must reckon with this during a creation of a model.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success we was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but its image and marketing have made it a star.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of designers are still cautious.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
And the familiar faces the sometimes see as unnecessary (it is sufficient that I know something but I look at the second).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
And if someone is a styling from us, then we must rely on the fact that we are with high probability a completely different size (smaller) than it has in reality.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
We have then to navigate on google and ensure if Supporting Boulevard of the celebrity in question, if it has weight or grown etc.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to move in the mode and assemble models.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
He should contact the persons he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Guess is people, not to pander, keep his opinion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
"When a manager asks you sort his cabinet and the complete new elements you can't throw everything and say, My God what horror."
</seg>
<seg id="56">
"You will find a few cases that you will find him and advise them with what you wear them," says Mario.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
It has shown us what must contain what is known as the "placovka" or bag of designer.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
This is the one you hang around the waist and you have on you for everything you need.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
In addition to the things clearly defined as the scissors, the rolls for hair or pins to nurse, there is also the nylon (that the designer used to photograph products such as bags, or hats), clips with special ignored a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of bar are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or a sewing kit.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
So that we can not only of people listening but who tried something practical way they taught us how ressemeller properly footwear.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
And in the photo opportunity in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, particularly outside it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
And so we have glued and pasted.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
We were not entitled to receive the scissors to prevent injury inadvertently.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
It is therefore truly skills.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
Mario made me pleasure when he praised me for my creation.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
The jurisdiction which I have addressed is not for my girlfriend.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
This is only a small summary of what we have learned in the second weekend of courses
</seg>
<seg id="68">
I began to understand that the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants.

You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is the first to arrive in New York.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The idea has some interesting points.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The itinerary is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Which means that each race is on another route and the steps in different environments that differ quite well each other and are interesting.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The player does not have the sense that the game is something identical to it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Some environments are also quite beautiful even if the technical level is the same kind of previous levels.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Finally it is not the end of the world.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But the driving through the desert, in landscapes of fall or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant visually.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The tests are in addition from time to time with a non-standard element.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that you decreases the visibility.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In the mountains and then you have to pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In addition to that the different races are well designed them one by one.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
There is only a small number but that is enough.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
There are moments you strive to exceed the number of opponents (as in a conventional running) and then you are against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then still awaits you another duel with an adversary.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
From time to time you also have the police entering the game and trying to get the situation difficult.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
The novelty outside the vehicle.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Rather, it is an interactive when most of the time Jack fled to someone and you have to help by slapping the right button at the right time.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Nothing complicated.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
What is surprising is that there are moments of this type that what you want to be concrete (there are only three).
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The result is this because this is not likely to hinder, in the context described above, in the elements that enhances the game.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but we cannot say that this is negative.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
With regard to the realistic simulation you go see elsewhere.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But although there are better in the conccurrence the model of conduct goes very well with the type of design.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
So everything is ok.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The problems start to appear after a period of time.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Has the diffférence model of conduct, that of collisions is not yet ready.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
We do not expect this game a complicated and collisions, but when you did not, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how well your car, this is not completely good.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
During the overruns tight you touch each other sometimes slightly but otherwise your car share in acrobatics mad.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Or is found.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Through the system, this is not really a problem but that you really riles.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The recovery is so that when you phut or you are out onto the stage the game you back at the time of the last point on the route.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
But you have only 5 reboots.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
When you have used the 5 reboots you have to start the game from the beginning.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
It is therefore more a tool, in the event that something is not right, that old adage on which you can really count.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Sometimes the reboots do not help and we must find the solution in remémorrant memory piece of the route in question.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The central fault of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
For example, there are some turns that we must move from a certain way otherwise it does not.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
Otherwise you meet on a given location of vehicles "civilian" always in the same configuration that you have come first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or a minute late.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
The angry this are the situations when you see the adversary move easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, you need to be set aside and the conturner or brake.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
It is equal if you go out to him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it is always close to your nose.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Opponents also have other benefits.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
During the period of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you still have the same opponent in front of you in the same place.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
This is the thing most at the end when driving on a bridge in the opposite direction.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
The enemy must at all costs to you.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
When it passes you you obstructs the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter into a number of times.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
It is understandable that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that bored quickly.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
And it is a pity because through a model of conduct simple the game is interesting and areas with both action that you do not have time to follow everything that happens.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, the order of the races is such that there is no chance of being bored or something else.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
The original idea is the change in car during the races.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
You must pay attention to the fuel pumps on the routes because you can change cars but most of the time that you will suffice.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
The cars are divided into three categories.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
The sports cars are ideal for cities, the big-engined American for highways straight and the super sports cars to exotic trappings on the pipes very technical for example, on roads in lace in the mountains.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
And the method of challenges, which are racing in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main plan of history.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
You receive not only medals but also experience points to be added to your profile that is common to the challenges and adventure.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects are beginning to unlock:
</seg>
<seg id="69">
It connects with the on-line function Autolog which among other compares your results with those of other players and you provide other functions in the community.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
You arrive with your car in the tunnel subway (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on tracks (it looks like).
</seg>
<seg id="72">
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km / hour (a priori) and behind you is a subway train that sends you the car directly to scrap metal.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
Has the drafting we had a discussion for a few days to determine whether someone has actually thought at the time of the creation of this game or if the authors take us for fools.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really cool.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Which hampers is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
This concerns especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid does you no good.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
The audio portion is good and the runway is choice.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
In order to please the more and more particularly the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix," but it can be expected that, and the game for music.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
If the game had not these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NTS in recent years.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
The amusement is really well but prepare you to ensure that the mistakes you type in the eye with the force of a reflector aerodrome.

vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Czechs behave as négativistes and Eurosceptics
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="3">
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically deleted the balance between the institutions'
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"I did not expect such a war as hard."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players get used to their new role," is how Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law Ambassador Czech near the European Union.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
When she was able to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University could envy, it has shown how it takes its motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"From the beginning echoed the criticism that it is bland, that this is a desk, that there can rempplir no mission and I must say that it has knocked the wind out of everyone because it takes its role to perfection."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"This is a man who listens to 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who is that the European Union?" "What do I call telephone number?," so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater readability of the policy of the Union in the face of the statements, such as China or India.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese cooked who feel very strong) 
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Madam Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that has lived, lives and will live in a time near the European Council.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago of succeeding.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Czech have solved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a summit for a Partnership Oriental.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
She described the fall of the Government of very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The Czech representation to the EU is currently very busy.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In the words of the Ambassador, Madam "activity reached its high" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve even now.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
There must also approve the new budget septimal of the Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and economies, which industry will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Madam Ambassador recalled the slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an Europe understandable."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"I really don't like the foreign words, abbreviations, jargon that nobody understands.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
As the citizen must understand that it is true that nobody in Brussels of gherkins or twisted, bananas, large or that nobody has prohibited syrecky. "
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It wants to use the environment of the EU and see more of Czechs in the European institutions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptic and people who see the things that in their negative aspect that positively.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In addition it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support of the Czech part.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A Czech Presidency to success she then underlined the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Believe me, when I come to the Poles, the Magyar, the Slovak, English said:" Hey, what you do, that there is still the Visegrad? "And it is not at all happy."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future new rules hard fiscal policy facing the Member States.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at different speeds, which is rather than a "new European Federation."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
"We have countries in the euro area and other outside the area."
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
First it was said that cooperation among the countries that do or do not want to remain in their corner. "
</seg>
<seg id="35">
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be an Europe really two-speed" Madam, expects Vicenova.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases in which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not just the policy of the eurozone.

The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="3">
If someone had to seek the word which is as close to the IBM strategy, the nearest would be "the long term."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and yet since its creation it took a hundred years.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The basis of this long-term strategy has been laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He left the slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Its slogan "PENSE"! "Became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It was the basis of the culture of the veritable developed by Watson.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
IBM for us means thinking long-term continuous movements led to the future.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that she always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all other around it.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This has allowed us during our first century of technology, business and society.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "has reported for the anniversary the current Director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
A system well prepared
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Watson, in the thirties, began to take care of its employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only one of the first American to have employees paid vacations, employer-paid insurance a more uniform of Employee elegant and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and the commmerciaux.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In the same way IBM has a system of relationships with the client well developed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to abolish any form of discrimination and could have the choice.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because this will be a Rometty women- Virginia - which should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is working with IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
IBM in recent years is what is known as the jamy, brain- storming online from what are many future strategies and innovations.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It is not surprising that he had a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly 500000 people work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
An institution with a good name
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
It is the internal and external image of the company that provide a secure position in the areas of business.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a firm technology," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"IBM is not a firm Technology Policy but a firm that helps solve problems of the world of business using its technology," added Geogre Consulting firm Colony of Forrester Research.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As the firm itself there is a difference between enter the market and create this market.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
IBM - or the "Great Blue," as it is known in the United States with regard to its slogan- in a hundred years it has grown into one of the largest global firms.

This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, accommodation, services of Council at the level of the products of the server to nanotechnology.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
It has many patents of all technology firms American and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Among his discoveries is for example, the distributor of tickets, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion in the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.

</seg>
<seg id="33">
"From the moment that your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain fixated on the past," noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
For that IBM does not have a problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work she is headed.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Unlike for example, of conccurent Microsoft that at the base is and remains under the Windows operating system.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
In the IBM, services, which are trained to a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Yet in 1990 it was with more than the motié participation the highest representative of hardware.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
From the year 2000 IBM sold assets to low performance for $15 billion, during cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technologies.

<seg id="40">
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
IBM negotiates according to the requirements of its first head Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investments.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Now it appears that IBM is the current crisis without interference?
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The stock price IBM has progessé from 2008 in rocket by 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.

History of IBM: A from slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
The International Business Machines (IBM) was born in New York one hundred years ago; she had initially the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a mark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to 80 of the nineteenth century.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
They had technologies such as the old "clocking," clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
The architect of the new company was Ranlett Charles Flint that until 1930 the Supervisory Board of society.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
The leader of the then shadow the founder of the business - it is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and culture of the society.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Watson led the firm kusqu" in 1952.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production of all machinery possible for business and trade - of cheese slicers and meat until the cash registers.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
In the first four years during which Watson led, the turnover is multiplied up to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Watson was for the firm if irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership is the son who took the Chair of Director, Thomas Watson Junior.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language of programming.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
In the 60 s people and computers IBM NASA has helped guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family computer - the IBM System / 360.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
The PC classic which determined the standard computer at the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.

Twenty years later IBM sells its manufactures computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take on board and services with high added value.

<seg id="63">
The strategy that succeeds in IBM in the last three years - is the concept Smarter Planet "a planet smarter."

Rychtarova Darina (53 years) said it.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and return to the house.

If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome in the waiting room of the house.

The worst defects of women: It matters also?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
If you ask the men to determine typical defects, all women, both, are able to get them out of their hole. "
</seg>
<seg id="3">
My dear, you'll see in the following lines of vices female arriving to pump blood veins of men.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
The purchases
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
</seg>
<seg id="6">
You must buy at least a garment per week?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
You are happy to buy and packet during the sales?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In your case we can talk about the purchases as a vice.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Some women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But you will say, which would pass to window shop clothing stores, to seek for oneself of beautiful clothes and then try all cabin (the ideal of different colours)?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
And although for most women buy a hobby, it can be to man a hell.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Remember only how many times have you said to your spouse he waits to entry...
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Continuing dissatisfaction
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"I am not too big"?
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should start in sport?"
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"I like?"
</seg>
<seg id="17">
These phrases you send, not something?
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Yes?
</seg>
<seg id="19">
You are therefore part of these women who are so obsessed with their appearance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
This is not the question that you should stop to look after yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complain about her appearance.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Sex strong does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and more women are empoisonnantes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
The following orders and cleanliness in the first place
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
This is like a merry-go-round.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Window washing, vacuuming, clean soil, dust, stripping the bathroom - and this twice a week.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
You made the remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have sullied the sink, fouled the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
In case you have precisely this obsession, try to bear in mind that we should not exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness must not be the first place in the family.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This desire harmless of cleanliness may spoil your relationships and even family peace.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
The work of undermines
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
"This tracksuit used in the bin."
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"You put these old socks again tomorrow?"
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"A wet towel has nothing to do with land."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
If you do on your partner this undermining of this way several times a day, you really break it down.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
It is clear that you are not going to harm you want everything is impeccable.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Perhaps if the men knew, women would not have to be so much work of undermines...

</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Defamation, sexual taunts
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
Defamation, sexual taunts and insults against someone are also the own for some women.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Women are particularly likely to relations and so are happy to deal with issues like that, where, with whom, how and why.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Perhaps that each of us a small sexual taunts harmless here and there.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Hand on heart this is a feature of women.

How have evolved travel prices since 1989
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Until 1989 there were only 5 in Czechoslovakia travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, elements, Rekrea and Autotourist.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Travel agencies at the time of travel, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west were very limited.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Czech tourists were traveling for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
A large exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was authorized to travel in Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a fondness for the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for tourists Czech.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The great paradox of the socialist era was that he was not authorized for the citizens of the Socialist block (also for African-American) to travel individually even in the framework of the socialist countries.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In the case where the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example, in Poland and the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation if not the individual was not authorized.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the West but had to wait in line all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good standard" within the travel agency.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And even after that this was not yet won.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The agreement for the currency that was the condition for travel to the west was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of foreign currency (Western) to travel to the west.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The Czechs were most often their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs are bought and this usually lasts up to now.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Travel of Czechs have since been since 1989 a major revolution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The great paradox which we have not aware today is that the country's most popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The abolition of visas in the 90 s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave of visits of short duration especially in Vienna in Austria and Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Czechs could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
For example, in Paris organizations travel the Czechs were sleeping in tents in parks because our revenues, we were unable to pay the hotel or a pension.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The typical feature of a Czechs was at the time of transfer its own food, sausage, etc... To save.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna has allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy the currency.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased which resulted in around the year 1997 another important moment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with bonds by charter air through contracts have extraordinarily reduced costs compared to what there was before.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
In the late 90 s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries around the world to share the EU who later have facilitated our trips.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Another interesting time in the history of tourism post-revolution was prepared, when the first charter air to a country exotic, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Since this year as each year of direct air charter take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
This is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the country each year exotic!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Still an interesting time in this period that symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
On November 17, 2008, the EU have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to join completely in the group of developed countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than $15 000 per person for a vacation abroad including the annexes. Crowns per person.

The General Assembly must find its President but it may end with a situation without solution "a pat"
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Nearly 5 months already football Czech President and it is without risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known even after a General Assembly to be held on Thursday at Nymburk.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
However there is still no agreement on how to vote is required.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Without this agreement it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Hašek has resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Only during the era after Hašek football came back to differences between the chambers of the Association who may not agree on a joint candidate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This has fully demonstrated on 16 September when he had to choose a new president.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Delegates to the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiation has been blocked and there was not a question of how to elect.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
There was no agreement on the fact of who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the representatives also statutory or officials with full powers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
In this single point there was a partial agreement since that moment with the help also of the Bureau for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the full power is not possible.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The differences continue always about the regulation for the election.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its negotiation planned or extraordinary, has contributed nothing to the situation
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Opinions on the possibilitě voting have changed several times but the key point remains the same.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The question is: how to the third round in order not to become the pat.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"The bone of contention is the following fact: either proceed under the Statute or find another model," noted one of three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents professional football in the association.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
According to the rules of the model is expected in the third round as the candidates who received the most votes in percentage terms in the Chamber for which he or she is a candidate.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw in order that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes of the two chambers.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
And the Czech Republic is the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and this would completely deny the concept bicameral," admits Svoboda which includes the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote under the statutes in force.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even if it considers that elections in the Statute benefit the most Pelta among all the candidates.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"I would like to vote according to the statutes of the association."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"For that there is not yet of ideas such as imagined by a representative during the General Assemblies past," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and which in its submissions is defined primarily against Pelta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Pelta remains optimistic.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
According to him to Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will co-operate in the future together and in a constructive way.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"The qualification possible today in Championship should calm down."
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"Football will be back on a wave of happiness and there one more drive for a cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec which of the three has the greatest experience in leading football both professional and at the regional level.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
rajchl is more pessimistic.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are trends to change regulations to design."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"This can lead to a blockage at the General Assembly."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"I hope that the healthy reason will prevail," said Rajchl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
There is not much time to a common agreement to all parties.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if any management of football will be complete for the match.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The specially chartered flight in which had to travel to Podgorice between the other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not departed for technical reasons and it was a variant to bring a part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the parties torn within the sports association the country and to an agreement.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
In the game there is a lot: a state subsidies, the credibility of the football and also the General Assembly of the Union of the Czech Sports that must determine the direction of the sport Czech after the financial problems of Sazka.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because it sees no candidate correct.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly that the profile would have responded to what it calls for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in campaign to this high office.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"If such a candidate, I support, I fight for him and I do not go for the election."
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (TKC).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta access to the head of the AFRT which in principle would be the most likely candidate for that election.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Paclik also points out that in cases where it won the next election it would hold the post of President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
He would see in an experienced manager and of a high level, but that is not linked with the world of football.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I have discussed with people who would have the profile," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"I would like to change this image," he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
Which, it is said, especially Paclik embarrassment, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Union regional football Plzen Roman Berbr, man to the controversial reputation that is known in the wings as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
</seg>
<seg id="52">
"And with the support of Berbr, which is a trader from top flight, it would be even less favourable football," proclaimed Paclik.
</seg>
</p>

What the still shocking is the fact that the name of Pelta was delivered a few years ago in the course of eavesdropping as part of a corruption investigation, for which Pelta has emerged without any sentence.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
"I do not know what Pelta prestige would bring to the football."
</seg>
<seg id="55">
"And how would we be regarded in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," says Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
In the case where Paclik prevail in the vote on Thursday, it should prove that he could work with Felta.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, think the same thing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
"It (Pelta) would be the first with which I would go."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
"It has strong abilities"
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"It would be able to show up for example, as Head of the representation."
</seg>
<seg id="61">
"But as manager of the Association it would not be capable."
</seg>
<seg id="62">
"I keep my nose out of this that I do not know," says that Paclik in September attracted much attention when it has called for the annulment of the Commission of the arbitrators with ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
Paclik says that it would be at the level to lead the Association.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that he also directs since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with its support last May's triumph in first division.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture."
</seg>
<seg id="66">
"I freinerais the influence of special interest groups that have for example, tend to affect the Commission disciplinary and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik that do not chache its antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
It also would consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power to lobby with high-level political would provide for sport more money from the tax on the games.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
"It is one of the key points that the new President should address."
</seg>
<seg id="69">
"If it is the tax on games of chance and the political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
Paclik does not take its current with the club of Plzen as something negative even if he says that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties."
</seg>
<seg id="71">
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
"This is not ideal."
</seg>
<seg id="73">
I see no reason to convey my shares of the club of Plzen to someone if I have to go back a year and a half after, "said Paclik.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to situations of pat.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidate to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future to rows over the regulations for the elections.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
The official of Jablonec is before the meeting on Thursday to Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the success today of the representation of football should calm this squabble before the vote.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
Pelta before the election of September which has not carried out promised precisely to focus on the national representation and financial resources if elected.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly and the delay of two months could allow him to defend his vision of the direction of the football and present it in a broader context.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
"People at all levels of football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday, there is a President."
</seg>
<seg id="80">
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association," he says, but it is more closely associated with the club of Jablonec, worked a greater number of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
That is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is an euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly of June of the Statute were approved that were not perfect as all have seen."
</seg>
<seg id="84">
"Had it not all these various interprétattions we would already have been a President since September," said Pelta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the attention of delegates.
</seg>
<seg id="86">
"If I become President, I will take it as a personal mission and I am prepared to take all the responsibilities in the event that it does not work."
</seg>
<seg id="87">
"It is a principle without which we would not exist," added Pelta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">
Then it works, it is said, not to confront its adversaries.
</seg>
<seg id="89">
He said previously that it may cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he acknowledged having regard to his training in law and it knows that its adversaire-candidat would be its first Vice-President.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">
It has not contested for a long time Tonas Paclik that instead of criticising Pelta.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
"It is changing in football for a year and has already had some success."
</seg>
<seg id="92">
"Its attacks were not of the most honourable and has surprised many people during the campaign."
</seg>
<seg id="93">
"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," said Pelta to the address of his opponent, he says, but remains faithful to the proclamations that he made in September.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">
His weapon the strongest is his knowledge of football from the lowest level up to the national representation.
</seg>
<seg id="95">
This should be a vitirne of football.
</seg>
<seg id="96">
"And also I would endeavour to complete all the cases that begin with that of Bohémians or the result of the corruption scandal."
</seg>
<seg id="97">
"I would be entering immediately into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money to any football," said to the Czech News Agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not bring forth any change of people.
</seg>
<seg id="99">
"I should get acquainted with all employees," he told Monastery where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">
Although there are catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not Nymburk for nothing.
</seg>
<seg id="101">
"If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will come to the beat."
</seg>
<seg id="102">
"Football needs credibility and it will when there is a new leader," says optimistically Pelta two days before the day likely impact on her career public servant.

"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, of professional football and a football for youth."

"But I am not saying that I will do that alone," said in an interview for Rajchl TKC.

"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee to ensure that each member is responsible for a specific area."

"And I will hand out difficult missions for that football is a great step forward."
</seg>

"Many people will not be happy, because it will be to begin to work hard rather than criticise others."

He referred, it is said, that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical mood.
</seg>
<seg id="115">
"About me, it is known that I work 20 hours a day."
</seg>
<seg id="116">
"But I need to know if this is worthwhile and if I have people behind me that I will continually spanner in the works and issue doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.

<seg id="117">
"Many people have said that I should not give up, because they also."
</seg>
<seg id="118">
"It is a confidence that I cannot betray," he says.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">
This motivates them, they say, is also to continue the work begun with Hašek.
</seg>
<seg id="120">
"Since these last two years there has been a lot of fact and I do not want to let them down."
</seg>
<seg id="121">
"There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone.," "he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hašek.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">
"I think to a systematic work and that is something that Pelta Mirek do not know what to do."

<seg id="123">
"Behind him are people who fairaient football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been selected."
</seg>
<seg id="124">
"You can reproach me for a number of things but certainly not to support a situation."
</seg>
<seg id="125">
"I try to be objective."

"I want to make football for all because everyone will be happy not only those who have been selected

</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">
And it confirms once again that it would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="128">
"And there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do its utmost to Moravia."
</seg>
<seg id="129">
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts one and the other Czech Moravian which the winners would be in first division."

<seg id="130">
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is currently to find of young players.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl can assess its own chances of winning.
</seg>
<seg id="132">
"I feel the ongoing support of the House Czech who elected me as its Vice President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl which envisages among its future success to save tens of millions of kronor on contracts disadvantageous, negotiations of contracts with television and on the law on the games.
</seg>
<seg id="133">
He said that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">
While he said about Pelta "that it is disqualified because with him the footblal Czech would lose its credibility," he thinks that the second Paclik adversary is a strong candidate who has to offer football.
</seg>
<seg id="135">
"No one can doubt Plzen he made that year a superb job."
</seg>
<seg id="136">
"If elected he would continue in what has been started by Hašek and would not change among the people in the Commissions."
</seg>
<seg id="137">
"It does not want to spoil its success," said Rajchl which has assessed his rivals.

When Iris Meder were traveling research during the past 18 months, there is a subject that should not be missing from his baggage: a bathing suit.
</seg>

Lying on his back in the water, it was the cupolas artistically arranged, and swam against the marbles Putten who was waiting on the other side of the pool and was to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools of these converted.
</seg>

If a covered swimming pool was fun, it noted in his notebook without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented in his book already published: "Badefreuden Bain (the joys of everyday life." The municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the palaces of historical bath in the forest, "buildings of concrete Hardcore" in the Taunus.

The German 46 years is a real devotee of the culture of the bathtub.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Meder, explained that she has not much interest in the sport but feels particularly attracted to water in a completely different way.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It is irritating that fans of swimming must be content to rest of blue tiles and live with the stench of bleach, whereas the joggers breathe perfume mesmeric of spruce forests, or can listen to the trill of birds in the park.

</p>
<p>

And if the builders would have given a little more, the rooms to swim could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor has a surface water in the swimming."

The smell is alkaline waters therapeutic containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black and its silt you sticks to the skin as soon as you let slip in the pool - a spa experience.

According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has established a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.

Hamburg -
</seg>
<seg id="8">
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that the banks are speculating on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this business channel because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is the result of a decline at the direction of the organization of consumers Foodwatch.
</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid October.

<seg id="12">
The author Harald Schumann stressed in this paper that speculation Awards on raw materials, the price goes up and that banks share a complicity to famine.
</seg>

The campaign consumer protection is specifically against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect against price fluctuations.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But the majority of experts now share the view that the betting public have posted offers and requests - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.

Ackermann was responding to the criticism differently from U.S. competitors: It promised to investigate the allegations and said, "no matter is worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly today under obligation.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in his portfolio, for which the money was invested in speculation," said Bode.

"It is not important, for Mr Ackermann, but it is a question of people hungry or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
</seg>
</p>
<p>

The awareness of Ackermann may seem at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.

A history of architecture with senior, low and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell in ruins.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Now it is open to new and takes place of house of exposure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
If there is an enthusiasm for post-war modern architecture, for his clear forms, its hangars glass, its patterns and bold and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief to technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the event in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Pavilion Schwanzer was formerly the "Grand Prix for Architecture" for its construction steel and glass, and suspended.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The construction is up to our days as an important step in contemporary architecture.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He has made the architects if famous, he has also built the Pavilion for the Austrian.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
With its legendary home to four cylinders BMW and its adjacent construction in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the world in the Garden Switzerland at the station in the south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
</seg>
<seg id="12">
But the building was not physically or technically adapted for a museum - no walls to the works of art, not a good environment.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
However it was also long used, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Since 2001 the building was empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now known as "House of the 21th century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.

On Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The new start has been carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, which has become the new Director in 2007 of the gallery Austrian Belvedere.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian at a considerable career in his youth, figure skater, subsequently in Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, it has led to the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained of public funds and private sponsorship and exploitation.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Except contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba which the foundation of the same name have been exposed, a café and bookstore, and an office must be built.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Strict monitoring, small budget
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
For the Krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Not only because it had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna, and for him the flag was "an extremely important" place where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exhibits.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, who lost in generosity and lightness following his visit to Vienna and by its change of use.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In the current changes, there were major problems: the building was "a chasm energy," said Krischanitz.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The profiles of windows of glass facades were changed insulation, glass fibre reinforced glass and the roof was replaced by a glass of safety.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Two basements made room for the new operation, a sign of light, between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entry - it is almost a new construction, but always the slight Schwanzer Pavilion.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The exterior doors origins remained, the house is painted in a hue protection against rust colour red-brown.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
And the movie theatre is even exactly identical to what it once was.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"Often materials that are good and cheap were to be found, and that appeal also to the Office of the protection monuments," says Krischanitz and it draws attention to a soil crude underground.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Despite all the constraints, the problems and the transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a story typical of "Drop-in-the-City."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the conscience."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
But in this case the House of the 21th century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck: urban construction around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the "neighbourhood of the Central Station" any newly planned, with offices and apartments.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
And another stroke of luck may occur: the House of the 21th century could benefit from the support of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased the art centre temporary Berlin, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.

Since March, it bought shares with a value of more than ten billion.

So far the large U.S. investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not invest in companies computer IT, given that the long-term evolution of companies do not disclose that poorer prognosis.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, he read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector.

He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes especially of supply of services and computer systems for the IT sectors other companies.

An investment of Warren Buffett is seen as an attack on in the world of finance.

Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.

Buffett said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment so far.

"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.

After the discovery of the "cell Zwickauer" the Turkish media are skeptical of the state of German law.

<p>
<seg id="4">
The killing of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
As a result of this new, Turkey and the population German-Turkish reacts with fear and concern.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Because for many of the German-Turkish spectrum thought to death for a long time coming back: since the incendiary attacks in November 1992 at Mölln and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with this context extremist right-wing against the Turks.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
There is in Germany a xenophobia, it has never been question.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, shows the proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
"Is it a return to the ideology," bloody "was the title of the publication on the Internet for the Turkish daily" Haberturk. "
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-homme Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the quagmire of extreme right.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It is calmly responded that the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It is only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German political and Turkish had thought about a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It is with tapestry-woven woollen that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The reports of some Turkish media are the effect of a slap in the face: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the platform turque- Haber "X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Also the release of the "German Hürriyet" is not short of unambiguous conditions.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"It begins to puer," This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.

<seg id="17">
It stresses that people would have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The police action was seen very critically on the forums German-Turkish and they were subsequently discussed the success of their research.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Why it is not already come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities to investigate suspects in some quarters of the extreme right, wonder the authors.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
More than a means to at least rhetorical or drastic: "If the case continues to be rushed, it will remain to migrants nothing other than self-defence and armaments."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"It will be the best self-defence."

What this means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks at Mölln and Solingen in the 90 s have explained.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, on what the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The attacks have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community.

Once it is the failure of the German policy after the terrorist attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors at Mölln.

The Bank the most adventurous of Europe is not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
UBS has been almost in bankruptcy the financial crisis and patina meanwhile from one crisis to another.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is a German who must lead now.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
This is certainly not what Axel Weber's "was imagined.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
After his departure of the head of the Bundesbank; it has been informed in July that it would occupy a position in 2013 almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a major step towards a career unexpected and lucrative.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, has welcomed Switzerland; for its beauty and the UBS for its strength and has recently obtained from kind comments on the future colleagues.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"The UBS has passed the Turnaround."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything was going to change.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A merchant of securities of UBS in London had diverted all the safety systems of the Bank and had singed approximately EUR 1.7 billion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The head of the Board of Directors of the UBS Grübel Oswald, a banker known not only in Switzerland, has had to leave.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is regarded as since suffering - and all are asking: When Axel Weber does finally?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as communicated the bank on Tuesday.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It is not much more banker, "economy professor and President of the bank, and certainly would have needed a period of adjustment.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
At one time it assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has yet to prove once again that it has long since earned the title of "the largest bank to scandal in Europe."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Indeed, the UBS was a huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it patina for years of a scandal to another.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Nothing, it seems, are the proud if Swiss bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
It started during the financial crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and sound, but also shrewd, she combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Therefore the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
On the other hand, it had raised as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
This has made an impression.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The former banker Hans Geiger and later Professor of bank for many years in Zurich said: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank to my students."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"In the current perspective, we wonder: how is it that I could have simply mistaken to this point?"
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
It is profoundly wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In 2007 it emerged that for the first time something was amiss at UBS.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In the middle of the year the President Peter Wuffli withdrew from surprisingly, which was previously regarded as a high intellectual and a brilliant banker.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
A few months later it was why it was gone.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The division of the bank had singed with documents and has risen to write off billions.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
For this she did find investors, but that, shortly before, would have her: a bottom of Asian state non-transparent from Singapore and an Arab state, which was passed over in silence, to the point where it has never even learned his name.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
"This was the first time.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In April 2008 it has worsened.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The bank was to announce losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Ospel Marcel, who in 2006 was still the second Board of Directors paid to Switzerland, withdrew.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its mistakes, investment in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The National Bank has bought from UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which she could become co-owner of the bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Any Switzerland was hit - because it noted how this can be dramatic for a small country, to house if large banks.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Finally, the balance sheet total of the 2007 s "UBS rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"We have not been able to save the UBS once again," says the researcher of banks, Geiger.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
After the first disaster as a result of the second.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and was ready to publish the data from the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the taxman perhaps with the help of the Bank.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million - for repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with a fine.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
And UBS has more or less published that she had assisted in tax fraud.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
After the scandal Swiss bank secrecy has not been the same.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
It was followed by the withdrawal of the leader of the Board of Directors and the Chair of the Board of Directors.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
And the exodus of money from customers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
And the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business sectors: investment banking because of poor speculation and asset management because of the assistance to tax fraud.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
And, as there was a little calm, and as previously thought, that UBS would perform this was followed by this unfortunate history of title: a single merchant as rocketing EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank to the realization that something was amiss.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
And it publishes: with risk management in investment bank this still does not work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
"With the case Adoboli, it was noted that the control of risks to too little changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Also the Chief Financial Officer of a large German bank is safe: "the problem of the UBS is that it was not the control of risks in hand."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
However it was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long since taken their function, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too many risks, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.

For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: the national bank through the palace of the Credit Suisse, private banks Julius Bär as elitist.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
It is in the lobby of the UBS by a heavy door.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, before are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a major label to "safe."
</seg>
<seg id="67">
The UBS knows what the client research here: security.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another ruled out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
He would prefer not to read his name in the paper, finally as all Swiss bankers it does business with the two large banks.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
The UBS would have become far too large, trouve-t" it - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons were also common.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
"And even so, they have long been adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">
This was indeed the investment bank that has changed the Anglo-Saxon UBS, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of risen as the great Swiss bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small countries to seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS."
</seg>
<seg id="76">
With up to 68 billion francs, or approximately EUR 45 billion, the politicians have agreed to save from bankruptcy the vast bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
How could this happen?
</seg>
<seg id="78">
If we speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially to the size of the UBS.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks have entered into a huge group.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and has been steadily increasing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">
On the whole, it is that the two banks prédécesseuses different of the UBS have completed: a bank rich, but lethargy with as strong point asset management in Zurich and a poor, but certainly more already highly internationalised.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
Suddenly, the international investment banks have had access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team," says the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, which made its way to the top with the learning of the bank."
</seg>
<seg id="86">
But Ospel has relied until the end to Wuffli.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
And wuffli would probably have committed at the end a fatal flaw: "It was thought that its models were the reality," says Geiger.
</seg>
<seg id="88">
"This is a tragic fall."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">
Tragic, perhaps.
</seg>
<seg id="90">
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
The staff of the UBS remembers clearly meetings of leaders in which the leader of the group Wuffli always gave the same watchword: a Goldman Sachs.
</seg>
<seg id="92">
The bank was the U.S. investment bank the most powerful in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="93">
It commissioned the "League Tables" the rankings, which have documented at that time the success of the banks.
</seg>
<seg id="94">
After all UBS wanted to go up at the top.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">
Some steps have already been successful.
</seg>
<seg id="96">
In case of currencies and transactions of securities it has played a very important role.
</seg>
<seg id="97">
The business advisors, who had the responsibility, stressed however a weakness: in the international operations of interest, in the jargon banking "Fixed Income," there would be a huge difference compared with larger banks.
</seg>
<seg id="98">
The UBS would have gaps in products of mortgages.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">
To fill this gap, UBS has launched into an adventure, which nearly cost him his life.
</seg>
<seg id="100">
Hungry for growth, it is the bank itself that a fund management created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
</seg>
<seg id="101">
It has been a machine massive who packaged and documents of value based on U.S. mortgages - but which has also retained.
</seg>
<seg id="102">
Even when other banks were looking for a long time to get down.
</seg>
<seg id="103">
"Yet in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. housing market was in flames, the UBS purchased here," said Geiger, the banking expert.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">
More euphoria is more the fall is brutal.
</seg>
<seg id="105">
A manager after another had to leave, when put an end to the attempts proved to be more difficult than was thought.
</seg>
<seg id="106">
Positions with UBS became ejection and are so far bancaux.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">
The bank has an almost impossible task.
</seg>
<seg id="108">
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all business models suggested have disappeared.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">
The researcher bank, Geiger has already an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of assets, return to roots.
</seg>
<seg id="110">
But the bank does not (yet) go that far.
</seg>
<seg id="111">
But the investment bank must atrophying vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
</seg>
<seg id="112">
Next Thursday the Head of Sergio Ermotti bank wants to present the world its future strategy.
</seg>
<seg id="113">
The Italo-suisse 51 years of age was only supposed to be transitional when the bank broke away with surprise of his predecessor Grübel.
</seg>
<seg id="114">
Meanwhile, it emerged: it must lead to the business of UBS, announced Tuesday, the Bank of Zurich.
</seg>
<seg id="115">
Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the status of the mid-1990 s.
</seg>
<seg id="116">
It cancels 3500 jobs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">
But it will not be enough.
</seg>
<seg id="118">
The UBS needs a vision.
</seg>
<seg id="119">
Which is it?
</seg>
<seg id="120">
What does it want to earn money?
</seg>
<seg id="121">
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.

The new book by Peter Englund depth and generosity. "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The beauty and grief: A History of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters who you heart.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
A Board to begin: tape carefully this page and make your bookmark.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
You'll learn about these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in those few moments where, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Peter Englund is a historian and journalist Swedish.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize for literature.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He has written a book of which he described, accurately, as "a work of anti-histoire."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It contains a few names, the major treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is not so much a book about what happened, "he explains," that a "book describing what it was like." There are "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
"The beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences in war of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, on both sides of the war, of young schoolgirls and botanists to stair climbing machines, doctors, ambulance and sellers.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Some will become heroes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Other prisoners of war. Will lose some of its members, will become crazy or will lose their lives.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Their lives are here as the candles of a church: while some off, and new ones.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The book by Peter Englund departs from the history books.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Perhaps some statement to the idea that the First World War is that by the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"The beauty and grief" describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, the Mesopotamia and the East Africa.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one spent Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are a problem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
This book is moving from the first page.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such a hurricane Katrina, which the cordite.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
When its cannon ringing in the distance, and you are a mother at home, or are you staying fuyez-vous?
</seg>
<seg id="21">
That will come anyway?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for the war.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been expanded by assumptions, expectations, fears, ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
"The beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young Marine German ports.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Their stories are drawn primarily from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Most address the deprivation and the ability to cope.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "apex, ersatz everywhere."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Coffee, false imitation of aluminum, rubber, paper, wood."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
It builds on the food replacement in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It describes the "meat made of rice cooked in fat mutton (and finished with a false bones of wood); manufactured tobacco with root dry and dried skin potato; the amount of wood."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
He says that "837 meat permitted substitute are registered in the production of sausages and 511 cafés substitution."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Some stories address the honour and courage.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
An American recognizes its own drive to the savagery and declared the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what the men were targeted, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a polish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no formal barbaric behind your shirt and ultra-greasy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that it is likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
"When you is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have a public."
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Other comments related to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition" wrote Peter Englund, "a war between the plants."
</seg>
<seg id="40">
It captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and convinced ideologically, clothing well pruned, which carries out its beef while sitting behind a desk."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
People act in unexpected ways; there were as many core behaviours that heroism.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"The most grotesque in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and" splashed on the genital organs in the hope of ending up in hospital, "he writes.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"The more desperate to apply on the eyes, resulting in blindness to life."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to its task of humanity.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has "triggered forces exclusively uncontrollable: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are a war.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
The best books on the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and the memory of modern) Paul Fussel, or "A west nothing new," Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The work of Peter Englund is a pantheon.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
The end of the book is the most damning I have read in a work non-fictionnelle.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
I must admit.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
But it is as if it had emerged of his book, seized of your hands this page showing the list of people and burned with a match.

The union of school aid continues the city for redundancies
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The union representing hundreds of aid school who lost their jobs last month plans to initiate a trial Wednesday to the city to unnecessary redundancies and discriminatory. The impact is disproportionate on schools serving disadvantaged pupils.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, in an attempt to put a stop to layoffs.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Six hundred and seventy-two aid coordinators of school, parents and other employees, part of the paid less of the city, have lost their jobs on October 7. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political vendetta that she did not allow the city to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have to close the budget gap last spring.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Municipal authorities have denied the accusation.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
At a hearing before the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
A member of the Council responded, saying that the layoffs of school aid n "were not specified in the budget.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
The officers of the Council of the 37th District said they would fulfil a notice of claim, warning the Education Department that it would be pursued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Dennis M. Walcott and the department of education of the city will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers made redundant, all black in colour or origin Latin American, as most of the aid school who have lost their jobs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has still not been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union based on the number of redundancies in schools in the most deprived areas of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that schools the poorest would lose the most aid due to underfunding.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
While there are no dismissal on Staten Island, and a few sentences in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in the 23th District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts southern districts in the Bronx.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of school children live in poverty, the prosecution say that "This is not a district of affluent parents who can get funds to make up the difference."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The budget of the Public School 36 has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of supplemental funding for each entry "student.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The union also says that the directors of schools have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The memo employed the term "overshoot" to describe the action, even if "overshoot" described more generally to the action of moving a teacher in a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
According to the complaints, "Sixty-six coordinators of parents have been laid off," and "not only because they have exceeded."

Mission: Congress reaches an agreement on the issue of Libya
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
It would appear that the Republicans and the Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the question of the uprising in Libya.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It took an uprising succeeded, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as the American involvement.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
The language may be harmless but the debate on the Libya has never been simple to date.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This summer, legislators of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the role of the United States military in the NATO mission in Libya.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
But the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies has also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of U.S. operations in Libya.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The American mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory - the legislative Congress upset enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug from underneath the foot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The indecision of the Congress has been overtaken by events.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The Senate can now act.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "congratulates the Libyan people for their courage and determination in view of freedom" and "congratulate the men and women of American armed forces and their coalition partners involved in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and professionalism."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to reach an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."

In the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all of the Congress, Republicans and some Democrats.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.

Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
There are at least 15 versions in the House of the only amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who "control federal spending."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.

A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to request to change the menu of his breakfast.

More pity that respect for troops

Kid Rock sang a ballad on the powerlessness, frustration and loss.

"The men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
A higher-grade military present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States, has seen the role of troops in different ways.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," wrote the higher-grade military in an e-mail.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
I am sure that the organisers had good intentions.

But this was not just respect. The pity.

The conflicting impressions absolutely illustrate the difficult relationships which arose between the military and an U.S. public passionate but often distant.

<p>
<seg id="13">
Praise was lavished on the troops for their sacrifices.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But they have a certain price, say some.

The public increasingly acts as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.

"We are not at all of the victims," said Brigadier General B. Sean MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan.

"But it would appear that the only way we support is to lock ourselves in the role of spirits unlucky."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
It is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not wish to appear not grateful or disagree with the public they serve.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They also realize that the anger of returners troops of the Vietnam War was much worse.
</seg>
</p>

<seg id="20">
Thus, most of the conversations on the mercy are held in confidence among veterans.

After the return of his two sons of combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian has warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

Some would be with respect as they have been confronted with insurgents and travelled to remote locations.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Others may be asking if "a veteran angry and violent beneath the surface," says Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work on the Government to Washington.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people that made him the interviews were subtle if he would be able to cope with the stress of a strenuous job in Washington immediately after his return from combat.

"When you raise the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son.

The difficulties of military arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The victories are rarely pleased by a country unfamiliar with the army and who sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Susan Burke says the military galonnées, because the problem begins with them.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"Who are individuals in a position to" eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders. "
</seg>

<seg id="19">
Counsel also states that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future legal proceedings.

Its strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - putting all your eggs in one basket - it will initiate several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defence, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injury caused in the armed forces.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by personnel on active service.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of complainants" indicate the documents.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The Department of Defence refused to make any comment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Things have changed since the 50 s.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
While women have still not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction has only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, particularly in contact with the local women.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Result: on the two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It is time for the army to modernize says Susan Burke.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
It is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to his own.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
In the Yale Law School, the centre of veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, by focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" awarded to victims of rape to give them leave - a relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru Service Women's Action Network (action network of women military), a group for human rights.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
His group filed a lawsuit in December to the Veterans Administration, blaming them for discriminatory practices in the way of dealing with requests for benefits for persons have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Nine bills independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a mixture of bipartisan senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded in the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) the Department of Defence.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19.000 incidents that year.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The report released in March is also studying the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of cases in the army have been the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
The complainants "case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first in a series of injuries.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In the case of Lyman, she informed the Military Police of rape less than a hour after the fact.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
That night, she says, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape at different police, doctors and commanders.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
It has suffered a "rape kit" (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of her assailant - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, a trial in which it raised questions about his sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier on the day of his aggression.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Six witnesses testified as witnesses of moral character for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
"I remember the day the verdict was reached," says Elizabeth Lyman.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I thought I was going to begin to have contractions. I started yelling at the court."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I exit, I remember saying to my commander" This was not his trial but my own. ""
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, which eventually diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
In January 2010, she was dismissed in terms of less than honourable, to receive any benefit.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
Does the case Lyman and other complainants proceed or not, that is a long history, "says John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction comes between them and a verdict.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
I have always criticised the doctrine Feres.
</seg>

The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and deterrence posed by the responsibility.

These things change only when the right have the will to fight.

If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, counsel for the complainants, will bring together hundreds of other complainants to other trial.

The walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy with his anti-immigration views online.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken of a murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, has faced its first trial.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from the be in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with a few millions of nationalist who support the far-right groups on social networking sites.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But how to find them?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Easy... Support to Facebook.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"We have realized that he was not that hard to find," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the Reflection Group thinktank on the digital populism in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Facebook is so full of personal information, "said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the promotional tool of the site to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way marketers have for years.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
L "team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that half a million members are fans extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It has targeted with advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, announcements invited users to respond to an inquiry. Questions raised their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
By coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues interviewed 10.000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"It is a new way of doing research," said Jamie Bartlett.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Some results are not at all surprising: supporters online groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But surprisingly, "those who associate activism online and offline are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
L "study DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the issues that affect the health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "I love," publications on the walls and restated articles.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
With more than 800 million active users who add content on average three per day, the "supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research that the site's name appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study of the people that you could not approach in the street.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"Before, when you were to conduct investigations on members of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"You had to go to the party, but you would have never allowed to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and treat the health and social problems.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who spoke of their exploits on Facebook while intoxicated had significantly more likely to be alcoholics that students quiet about them.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Megan Moreno suggests that the Members of students, such as consultants, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would speak too often of alcohol.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"You can't deal with a problem if you do not diagnosed," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and Director of the Centre for the health, behaviour and development of children to the Research Institute for Children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"We know how to identify children at risk, and that would in another case not recognized."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Facebook also constantly access to information of its users.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
L "site team that handles data studied the statistics on the situation in love and the day of the Saint Valentine, the turnout in the mid-term elections of 2010 and a national index of happiness (with the information available - only the champions of freedom digital have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to others for research purposes).
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But users of Facebook know that the site notes that they like it or not - in exchange for power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres, the site is authorized to access your information.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
But what happens when users of Facebook are part of a survey that they have not even heard of?
</seg>
<seg id="31">
While researchers have clearly defined instructions on how to collect the information other than through the Internet, it is anything else online.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, according to a 2006 study he led by observing the Facebook walls of its students.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"They know, exchanges were seen by their friends."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
And then there is the question of methodology.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of an user.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two entirely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
That is why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn think a pad and pen remain the best tools that can be used.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with the people," he says.

"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" in his first appearance at the trial being held in Oslo.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
"I am a military commander of the resistance movement and of the Temple of Norway," he said before a hearing room full of 500 people.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"With respect to the jurisdiction of the court, I repudiate, as you take your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I recognize the facts but I am not pleading guilty."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue because it "did not want to give him an opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
For the same reason, it refused to allow Breivik, who has brought with it a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody twelve weeks more, he was told not to talk to the media for four weeks and that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Some parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Some came in the hope of Breivik look in the eye, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"I found cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"I n" was not comfortable, but I have a little progress having seen and heard the suspect. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at reporters and the survivors in the eye in and out of the court.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a broad movement of "resistance," the judge has determined that it was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that it has acted with accomplices.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which will perhaps some.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"I would have preferred that it looks like a monster, but this is not the case," said a relative of a victim.

7 lessons of the interview lost to Steve Jobs, film this week
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical innovations and inventor of the modern computer.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But what the fans of Apple may find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs found recently and which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the major markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the process and work flow of products.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. Identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a breeding of organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders had a "disease their that suggests that a great idea is 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work between a great idea of a product of exception."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for more than a hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
By then, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. It was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
When a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he stated that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage the director.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This video, slightly, is the basis of the 68 -minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will air in cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose philosophies technological and business strategies.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
And incredibly attentive.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in an effort to provide a clear answer.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
There are also times when perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where he seems anxious to hear the issues of Cringely, kicking it elbow to accelerate to questions or issues of greatest importance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what it sees as good or bad in other businesses and her own vision on the future of the computer.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and based on the man we see here, the dreamer anxiety on the eve of the magnitude.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It explains and then put in place.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Here's a quick summary of seven sequences of Lost Interview:
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
On how he learned to run a business:
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"During all these years, I have always asked:" Why are you doing things? "And the answers are always the same:" oh, simply because they have to be. ""
</seg>
<seg id="21">
No one knows why, no one is thinking in depth to things in a company.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
That is what I discovered.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Steve Jobs is giving details of its efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Puzzled as to how the costs were registered - it often begins with a "standard cost" of a rule of thumb, and then adjusted with a "variation" - it has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
On the opportunity to play a round to Pope:
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and call for free long-distance.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The device has been the subject of much written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
He describes how he and Wozniak have tested the box using a public phone, then an appeal by linking a network AT to another while avoiding as many satellites as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"We enveloppions the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and it was a minute later on the telephone public next door," Jobs said with a laugh.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"We were young and through the Blue Box, we learned that we could ourselves create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
We do not know much every two, but we have been able to invent a small thing capable of great things. It was a lesson incredible, and I do not believe that Apple would have ever existed without it.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Steve Jobs is telling a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are convened in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices in laughter just before the Pope himself is awakened.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
On his love with technology (and lobbying of Bill Hewlett):
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a counter, it is the number of Bill Hewlett in the phone book and gives him a call.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Shortly after their 20 -minute conversation, Steve Jobs is a summer job part-time in Hewlett-Packard.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"This had an impact on me." C "was the only company that I had seen in this article and this has formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the research laboratories at the company, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
</seg>
<seg id="39">
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small tube. I fell in love.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The adolescent that j "was returned in HP and began to write programs for this machine.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
On the improvisation of innovation:
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Early in his career, when he moved to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a computer.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Working with only 30 days of credit, it had to take care of the assembly and delivery of devices.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I remember large disputes... I was yelling, claiming that I would have five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I am out and went to see a designer."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make $15 and which was incredibly reliable.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Large enterprises that run out of steam:
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Well before it is revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
"Recognise that you work with IBM and Xerox, you are a better or a better printer, and after?"
</seg>
<seg id="51">
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the company does not meet more successful.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Sales and marketing can evolve, so [it is these types of people] that eventually lead businesses and product are available to the "gap decision-making.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
The engineering product which led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the manual work required.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
This is what happened at Xerox...
</seg>
<seg id="55">
Xerox could hold all the computer industry.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
She could have ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90 s...
</seg>
<seg id="57">
They uprooted the defeat to victory.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
On innovation as an art form:
</seg>
<seg id="59">
"A huge part of manual work between a great idea of an extraordinary income... As you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
</seg>
<seg id="60">
You learn a great deal on its subtleties.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
There are trade-offs... Some things that you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories as well.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
You have to keep thousands of things in mind these (concepts) by assembling to each other.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Finally, decisions are taken by personal taste. This is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and try to make these things to the product that you create.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Picasso once said that the good artists copy and that the great artists steal.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
We have always ashamed to fly excellent ideas.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It is part of what makes Macintosh. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
If this is for the computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.

Scalia and Thomas dining with opponents of health law while the court meets

<p>
<seg id="2">
The day the Supreme Court will meet in private to consider the issue of political discord, namely if the opposition to the law of the President Obama health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm of lawyers who will defend the case to the High Court.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges are gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.
</seg>
<seg id="4">

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument from 5 is expected in March, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilisation of the presidential race of 2012, which will be growing at the time the court's decision will be made.

The lawyer who will be held before the court and argued on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
The law firm of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen firms that have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society Fédéraliste (Society), a group of dedicated to defend the legal principles.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the court on the case.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Was there, among other things, Mitch McConnell, top Republican of the Senate and sworn opponent of the bill of health.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The featured dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Fédéraliste for years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of conduct.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
If they were, they would probably by the Code of Canon 4 C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising organizations related to the right and although the judge may not be a stakeholder, a guest of honour, or appearing on the program of such an event."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two law firms of the case, as well as a business with a financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court will meet the same rules for all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"The judges drinking and dining and a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds of this event removes any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Fédéraliste.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative activist, specifically.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Furthermore, the Conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law have been laid in the court of first instance.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
His critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself to hear the case, saying that she was too invested in defence of the law to be impartial.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Kagan has given no indication that it would do so.

The exhibition urges Asia to help the euro area
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Asian Development Bank has applied to India and China to prepare to help the euro area to get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a decrease in the long term that would prevent the development of Asian economy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Rajat Nag, the Director General of LADS based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest in the world should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or bilateral agreements.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
He cautioned the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to watch the difficulties of Europe of a "indifferent eye" and reported that a financial support Asian alongside the leaders and resources of Europe would avoid long-term impairment of the global economy.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"We are all together in this crisis."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.

"Asia can be protected until" at one point but it is not immune. "

<seg id="8">
"So if China and India can help, that there are no limits."

In recent months, the euro area has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis.

Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously skyrocketed and prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.

<p>
<seg id="11">
The crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has set off the fear that the global economy is in recession, and the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area to find a solution.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Mr. Nag raised hopes that the IMF would any aid Asian, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - as the obligations of the financial rescue of the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided a greater bargaining power to Asian partners of Europe.

Severe warnings from the Pentagon on the potential reduction of defence
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, as well as the raising of civilians.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The Pentagon was already $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is concerned now that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts are imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is known as sequestration, would result in 23% of reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
"A significant reduction, and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our vessels and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
"We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The reductions would ultimately affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
"While the funding of the accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the sequestration, the war efforts would be negatively affected by the disruptions in the core budgets," warned Panetta.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"The Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that support the war."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"The staff manager salaries would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and policy support would be disrupted."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world of military power."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"We are strongly opposed to this drastic action," said the senators in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of the letter to Panetta.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and this is certainly not the one that we should impose."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
That the letter to Panetta and the recent warnings of senators are increasing the pressure for a budget compromise or appeal to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even if he managed to the highest position of the Pentagon with years of expertise of the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
In a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what could occur - a military with a shell but no core.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"This is a ship without sailors."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"It is a brigade without bullets."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"It is a fighter pilot, without enough trained."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"This is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs who do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"It is a strength depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"De facto, it invites aggression."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has set out specifically how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in combat operations future."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could one for the axe, including those already tested and some fair in the early stages of planning.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
This list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned ballistic submarine, the new generation, the new warship coastline and the new vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the navy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that this is an essential step to improve and response to potential threats from China and other rivals.

The stories of cheating on tests of the school and the university are legion.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
There have been cases where teachers have the responses by the tests students to see on their assessments of performance.
</seg>

The mentors who teach the opposite should send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
How many let's meet deception?
</seg>
<seg id="14">
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In fact, many of these are lies.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Another study showed that the foreign lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the objective is to scream: I had, "the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities with conducted a thorough search of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
One of the results of the research is that the old myths on lies were all.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The liars look at you in the eye.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
They bégayent turn red, or if not always.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Not to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
A lie detector qualified can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the micro-expressions facial, training of the issue and the response time.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
I spent several years to review of the scientific results in the vast body and always emerge of knowledge about the deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern jurisdiction that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or management.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The good liars are skilled to read the other, at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
We know from research that the extroverts lie more than introverts, men say more lies "citizen-centred" while women say more lies "focused on other" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people less often lie to their partners that unmarried (but that the lies that they tell tend to be huge).
</seg>
<seg id="27">
We also know that if you are seen as a miscreant, the other will feel less guilty when you lie.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
How can you say whether a person?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
First of all, observe the normal behaviour of your subject.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
This is called "establish benchmarks."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Watch the posture of your subject, the laughter, quality voice.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
You need to know if someone is normally its feet in order not to launch charges unfair when you see the feet in the middle of the meeting.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
And then look for signs of behaviour misleading verbal and non-verbal cues.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Consider these indices as of red flags, not evidence of deception.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
People can misleading around the upper body when trying to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, look towards an exit, change of posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult issues are.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the maintenance is completed just to seek to trigger the reaction post-interview.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Also, be careful in the vocabulary of your subject.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The famous Scott Peterson has gone wrong in the past while claiming that murdered his wife was alive, triggering a national search for the envelope.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Individuals can also use a misleading language outpaced: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman Miss Lewinsky..." or repeat fully a difficult issue.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The indicators are the most common are subtle.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Someone can use a lot of "language" at its response to a question difficult: "Well... To tell the truth... If I remember goods... To my knowledge."
</seg>
<seg id="43">
This makes the perceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by con artists in their professional and personal lives.

The draft, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutionnel, because of the fact that the regulation of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve.

The Prime Minister designated, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put at risk all the Eurozone.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
A news release of the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is expected that it presents a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Monti said that it would submit its report the result of his conversations with the political parties in his essay to form a government.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Monti has not said explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
"The framework is now well established," he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a reduced time more than usual, while Italy combat a political and financial crisis which pushed the cost of its debt to levels impossible to support.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy who had been affected.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Noting the pressure on Monti to dispatch, the instability of markets to put the performance of obligations Italian BTP to over 10 years of 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved.

<p>
<seg id="13">
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Labour Italian Confindustria, told media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support the government."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to this kind of emergency situation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The chances of success of Monti have been driven significantly by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, in which the crisis has forced to resign on Saturday.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"We believe that the efforts of the Professor Monti will have a good result," said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The support of PDL party, the Italian, is the most significant because until now many of its members had been opposed to the Government of that majority technocrat Monti.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Parliamentary support
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be reforms unpopular austerity.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack of financial markets.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The Italian association of foreign has added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.

Monti began Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and organizations juveniles and women.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It will complete its tour of meetings Tuesday night.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Monti was appointed by Napolitano Sunday, which has empowered an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.

After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt are now at critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new prime minister.

Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.

Monti said that his Government should persist up to future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that politicians will provide only the time to implement the reforms before the elections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be made only by specialists, an index of their objections before a process required by the financial pressure.

Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us.

This is the second time in South America and Central and so far this has been.

I spent to Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I think we can spend a few days.

Does this adds a bit of pressure to your visit.
</seg>

<seg id="20">
Some of the greatest shows that we have provided over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
We have offered a two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
We are really very keen to produce.

We love this country, we like to do in the surf and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.

</p>
<p>

How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
We have many friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves are amazing there.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
My friends would always to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, to Mexico, are great places to make the surf; that is how we learned, through the UW who like surfing.

</seg>
<seg id="28">
What do you have planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
As we have never products there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
You never repeat the directory.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
What is this?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
I believe that this is partly because we have nine and we can interpret more than 120 songs and love songs each different, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have more interpreted for a very long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us the reasons why we loved these songs and that we can have forgotten.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
This fact that the show is more interesting for us and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
With hindsight, it is difficult to believe everything that you have been successful?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Yes, absolutely.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
First, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for over 20 years that this is a dream.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together we émotionne much.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
We love and we love to create music.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
We are lucky to go places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Things could get better for us.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
That means to you having been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
This has always been a honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
From time to time, a group emerging from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups out at the same time in the same city.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
We are proud and it is a honour for us to form part of the group of Seattle.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Yet we play with some of them from time to time.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden in their tour, therefore we are lucky to still be friends with them all and it is a honour for us to form part of the sound of Seattle that arises.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
It is also very strange that a group like the your community united and with the same members for so long.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally last.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
First, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, second, we are all concerned for others.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
We are all close friends, and through this there are boulevards musical that give to each of the freedom to experiment.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We have confidence in each other with the music of everyone and this could go better.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
How do you find a balance?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who like your music.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
If we do not forget that people are there to music, it helps us to remember that we must respect the music and what has made, without getting in mind the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which is not really of any one of us.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
I think that we have written to good songs and early this was.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
We were a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
</seg>
<seg id="65">
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and most important is the fact that we are still friends with Bruce Fairweather and Greg (Gilmore) that began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It was a human being surprising and we are lacking.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
The national group Las Robertas will open the show to Costa Rica.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
Yes, the production has sent us videos with various proposals and this was the group that we have the best, so we are keen to see what Las Robertas can offer online and it must be very distracting.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
For what you always change the words of yello Ledbetter online?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
That's who sang and I believe it does with the first words he imagine.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">
As bassist, what are its influences?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
There are so many...
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Among the first I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
</seg>
<seg id="76">
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon on the one that I love.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
How Pearl Jam has managed to maintain the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">
I believe that we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
When I think, this reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have all at once, and if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
At first, his music was a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
What is this change?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that appear to be lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
With the two, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I have listened to them and these are songs deeply obscure.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
I think that if you are growing and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a friend or relative, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, this is for me.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
I also think that can also be pleased and even as the music can be made.

The plumber with the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3 D Land"
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Super Mario fought, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but it had never been done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3 D Land" will contend for the love of the young stereoscopic technology.
</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">
The title, which is this month to stores across the world, was designed to operate the characteristics of the Nintendo 3 DS console mobile, which can play in three dimensions without using glasses.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"Mario is the man who must say as must operate stereo without glasses," said the head of press to Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3 D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo originally designed for this format," because so far successes like "Star Fox 64 3 D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3 D" was adaptations of existing titles.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The spokesman for Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3 D, "Super Mario 3 D Land" is a video game "accessible" that allows a rapid and fluid.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3 D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" for users less adept.

Once overcome, the experts may cause a "second round" to levels of game, which this time are more difficult.
</seg>

In addition, users will be able to choose between a "D" or an aggressive which only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to plays in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions."

This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also means the return of the character to a mobile console, was faring more since 2005.
</seg>

In these video games Nintendo is a nod to the saga and repeats the formula for success of previous games, which is in the fact that the plumber mustachioed must travel platforms to perils to release to Princess Peach.

Park or mountain?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The architects coincide on the desirability of convening beyond the controversy on the fees
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The competition on the 16 gates opened up the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In the mid-80 s, in the height of the déjà-éteinte Corporation Metropolitan Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed stickers to promote Collserola.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that will not move on the north-south axis, if not top (mountain) - low (sea).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The qualification of Collserola as natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The reference was more Central Park, with Yellowstone or wild boar on the role of the Yogi Bear.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a composed form by 16 competition for all the doors of access to Collserola.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A door to the idea of park, without a doubt.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
That is, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The question appears alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The competition, both as regards its organization such as the reflection on the town is a topic of conversation of all architects of Barcelona.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is almost a recurring theme which two members of this former caste of elected speak when they themselves in an elevator.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
And this is one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
For Roldán, after addressing the front "there is a need to" discuss "the mountain" because the speech Ildefons Cerda, that of city blocks green was not conducted to end.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"It must start from the basis that the park of Barcelona is the beach.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Among other things for its accessibility.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
collserola is more complex, "has given the verdict which the architect for the title of" Collserola "contains a" trap "lexicon: we must think about" such as access to a park, but the demarcation of areas in which we must act. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world, described the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "a few perils."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Of the perils that is derived from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience in the 80 s and has been in the area of the Forum "his swan song."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The first fear is the own boundaries on which we can build.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"Limiting something means establish already the next step," that is, its overrun.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"We need to think about new planning instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can produce authentic disasters."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
By keeping more to the question, Modol opine that, by simplifying, the watershed of the region to Collserola El Valles "may be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat of which "should not be lost," by thanking for the opportunity that the city hall offers corporation to intervene in this project "from the first time."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In addition, it means that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this profile technical must lead multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he says) of the create: "We, architects, should be only one instrument."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the foundations of the competition it lack a global vision of Collserola: "The was convened 16 competition - he says - in the sense montagne-mer, but there is not a reading longitudinal track and understand the area as a whole."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
This fact, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 competition.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
In another way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the door.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In its opinion, yes, the council should ensure that the next to that of Ronda of Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that performs a soft transition between the city and the green.

MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Insurance Social is leading an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by experts in the NPI
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people, known as "Genetics of obesity among children and adolescents" that will have the markers associated with being overweight.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In a news release, the head of the Investigation Unit Medical Biochemistry in Hospital of Medical Specialization Centre National du 20 e Siècle, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
This team is supported by specialists and students from third cycle of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre of Investigation and for Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The investigation to be invited to participate in the population with right, or not to run for units participating sports of IMSS to Valle de México, where the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
He stressed that the protocol has started in the Sport Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the business is carried out in the Sport Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
After reaching the goal of having 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sport Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sport Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
He explained that the objective of this investigation and know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identify among children and young Mexican of risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
As we celebrate 14 November's World Diabetes Day, he indicated that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the purposes of specific questionnaires relating to food.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of inheritance of their disease, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions like diabetes or kidney failure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
He detailed the Saturdays will apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference measurements), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (one sought to identify the people associated with childhood obesity).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been an increase, in the case of boys, from 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; as regards the overweight also observed a dramatic increase," the specialist in the IMSS.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
He indicated that the justification for the detection of markers is based in the fact that the country's population is different from other by its history.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
He informed that, on average, the Mexican have a 65 percent of inheritance US-India, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability of burning the excess energy that we consume (calories), which is in the form of fat.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which can detect if there is a degree of overweight or obese.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Ila even said that the presence of folds (Acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of having metabolic alterations and even pré-diabètes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The information is managed in a confidential manner, physicians provide in writing to parents, which the report explains each of the measures and changes in the way of life that they must do to prevent disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: inactivity, which is the lack of physical activity daily, most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of going to foot on short distances.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Another issue is the high caloric intake, that is, the greater consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - block meat to corn flour wrapped in leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this Protocol.

The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Rafael Herrera, researcher, Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
If the reported that the pavement were resolved, there would be no need to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera, researcher in the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, which stated that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous deck is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
During its conference A opinion on technological, organised in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which it is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with mechanical resistance greater, both at high and low temperatures.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Herrera Nájera believed that this kind of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance and, therefore, the training of blackcurrants.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
He explained that the asphalt, the more heavy oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called, and asphaltenes molecules with a molecular weight, called malthènes, which together provide the paved his characteristic viscoelastic behaviour.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is the fact that at temperatures, high of nearly 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C it presents a status almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day in terms of environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist chemical engineering.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The researcher to the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three imply the asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Between the uppermost layer is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stone house in asphalt and compacted later.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Each small stones that form the layer, signalât-il, is bathed year asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
When the vehicle is registered in generating efforts, he allows that the forces are spread very well in the streets.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
If we had of modified asphalt, they will spread better, opinât the chemical engineers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
On the layer of asphalt, he says, there is a last layer called layer of turnover, made in gemstone, i.e., sand, which is also bathed in asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, she must have more mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and provide adhesion in the street.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the layer of turnover also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, "he says, because they affect significantly the performance of the layer of asphalt.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
When the soil is getting wet, the water runs into the layer is so that it is difficult, which softened all layers of the pavement and therefore because of blackcurrants.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
In the trial of a white, he says, which is the first strike is the film and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the injury was not immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with maintenance programs.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The member of the National System Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market, and to repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.

That has failed to Valle for the candidate to be the new miss Colombia?

Analysis of the factors that Melina Ramírez Serna not issue the crown of miss Colombia.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
The new Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, wear the crown of money and the band that it as new Princess of Colombia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the scepter, the amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who have found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
</seg>
<seg id="8">
What is he has failed? Because the result is the defeat of a great favourite that in every submission has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been elected in vain Queen of Police and Better Face Jolie in Vogue, obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The first key factor in the decision taken by the sworn to designate the First Princess is the fact that it has not satisfied with his answer to the question "? What was the book that has marked and why? By Murillo Martín Gómez, the Leamos Carreta Literaria.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
This is the response of candidate of Valle to this question:
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser definitively, I believe that the book that marked my childhood is" The Prince ," this book is a deep enough.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," this is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The love of the blood." "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
This response was not the first because of the term "culturaliser" and secondly for not explain specifically how each book cited the had marked.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt quiet and happy with the outcome "universe and wise, it is what has to happen.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And for all the world, see you a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Between the assumptions set that Valle was destroyed by patronage.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A journalist from Bogota has implied that being the favourite, the highly acclaimed and the candidate who received all prices (preliminary challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best costume, and Queen Mother), "it woke up the jealousy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not shone on the scene."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
And it noted that in his first presentation in swimsuits to the range of Hilton and two parades, the eve of the coronation.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Even if the two parades she had appeared confident even, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "Como in casa" (As at home), Canal NCR stated that the fact that Melina had been designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most prices during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the board on its interest in social initiatives, which is, in fact, the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
That is why two days before the election the juror international Lucy Doughty said they were seeking a woman committed in relation to the social needs of his country.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
"Only the beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
We speculate that Valle has sinned by its flaws of its behind and fibrosis who was in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, precisely because the board elected as the candidate Beauty "natural" with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
The initiator of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina had not the best body, that it was best, "but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too well known, has left marks the last day."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the review Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were surgical procedures that she had suffered.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"The surgery are good, but Valle has not been able to do.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
His body has never been its asset and she lost due to this aspect. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
For this award, that the National Beauty calls for the first time, after the parade in swimsuits has a cruel prediction that took place yesterday evening, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was to Melina for not giving her the taste of the crown.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of rule, not as a sovereign, if not as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competitions per designation of the National.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
However, she will spend in history as one of the queens that despite its dazzling passage Cartagena, did not receive the crown.

The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste ITC Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of terrorism: "Alfonso Cano" - testing its fingerprints.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of "availability of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Early in his career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he had spent more than five days in the forest to arrive at the venue in which the bodies that were to be identified.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after classes, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin friction, i.e. the palms and feet.

During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days.

He knew he had to identify two bodies and that the suspected one of them was that of the man who led the guérrilla oldest in the world, therefore he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognized by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.

Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a doctor and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.

<seg id="21">
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
To identify the bodies, the dactyloscopistes support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of individuals captured.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
When caught, many offenders have false identity cards or have not of documents.
</seg>

</p>
<p>

"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable areas for a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.

The fingerprints can also confirm or rule out suspects in cases of homicide.

<seg id="4">
The integrative movement occupies Wall Street have defied the authorities on Tuesday in New York in trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Hundreds of protesters pushing and shoving each other around the place Zuccotti, where they go through a judicial order that allows "indignant" camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation in a park north of the city, where there have been new judgments.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will install in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," dit-un spokespersons "Held Wall Street," Mark Bray.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Bray explained that the response of "indignant" in the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the area and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
In addition, the "indignant" occupied a new park at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the tunnel Holland, between New York and New Jersey, the property of the Trinity Parish Church.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
At least for a time they have been able to make the place, but after the Police had travelled there and arrested a few protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figures, ensuring Efe the fact that he has seen a few journalists who had also spent handcuffs.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The organization ensures that there is for people who had installed in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti - which is a forum for private property - remains closed pending a celebration of a court hearing under this Tuesday, during which we must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning.

Some protesters moved so far and were distributed at that time copies of this judicial order and they were the same agents who were monitoring the place, which has caused some small clashes ,"" said Bray, who denounced the fact that some official hit the demonstrators.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The order prohibits judicial authorities to evacuate Held Wall Street or to apply laws published after the start of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators to regain access to the park with tents or other properties that they used previously.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, which it has alerted to the fact that local laws do not permit to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The city councillor has defended the evacuation made personally to the place Zuccotti, an operation during which it has arrested 200 people and which was decided by the fact that the demonstrators "violated the law."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming "a place in which people were to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people," because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life."
</seg>
</p>
<p>

That the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.

However, the real challenge of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian stimulus that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from zero.

Spain "was taking place at the global level in the role of Micro-finances."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor in the world with regard to this instrument of cooperation that the "essence" lies in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being."

The Queen opened the V-e yesterday of the Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very specifically, for the purpose of the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes below a dollar a day, which is the" poverty line ."

Spain "continues to work" to enlarge the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and undertake this task with" responsibility, "said the Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and inputs origins during the Summit, which will last until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans.

The Microcredit Summit is intended not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which we must give "two goals."

<seg id="9">
And, Her Majesty explained that the objective is that at the end of 2015 there were 175 million poor families who have been assigned to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families out of poverty in which they live now.

<p>
<seg id="10">
The momentum in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the trail initiated a few years ago in a manner" by pioneer Muhammad Yunus, "said the Queen Sofía as an" act of justice and due recognition. "

This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in every meeting I have seen a continuing evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term "family head" meeting in Valladolid on the part of the "banking on the poor."

In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a "continuing obligation."

Jiménez took the view that the microcredit involves "a serious political and rigorous dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not allow it to be the victim of the cutbacks.

The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, Leipzig, was held without any real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel, but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program but has emerged in the fall, including to meet activists who feel the policy of the Government too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps of Italians tomorrow.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
About 1001 delegates, only nine were against and ten abstained.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The standing ovation of several minutes, that was given, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel, and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Finance Minister, provided no room for doubt.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The main strategy of Chancellor - and of the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to a breakthrough in Europe."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
At least this is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Of course, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also important.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But the milestone is made.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank based on the weight of each economy, which of course was to strengthen the weight of Germany.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
To appease the climate within his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but it has not sought to win its conference on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
If the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of the "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Except in hollow.

What does fraud represent the judgments disease?

<seg id="2">
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the judgments.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15, in Bordeaux to visit a child allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against fraud and the social handouts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
And to accompany this offensive, which share a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less heralds an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on the judgments.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
First in an aim of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose to employees of the private a fourth day of waiting before taking charge of a work stoppage.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Clearly, without specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, therefore at least 15% of their monthly income.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
A measure of anger, but that would be EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: officials to impose a day of waiting not compensated in the event of a work stoppage (they have not waiting period, for three days in the private).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also the issue of fraud, targeting this time for work stoppages.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will pay," warned Xavier Bertrand at the micro RTL, Sunday 13 November.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
As in other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of the fraud to work stoppages.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
We focus first on the national figures.

<seg id="15">
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than EUR 237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
According to the Institute of Research and Documentation in health economics, the daily allowances accounted for 2008 5% of health spending, with EUR 11.3 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Of this amount, 46% were the maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were the judgments, or EUR 6.2 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
And 2.5% of health spending.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
In 2010, the French have been an average of 14.5 days of absence from work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
An average that masks differences some: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75 percent of the 40 000 French employees surveyed reported that they had taken any day of judgment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the judgments were of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
When compared with their European neighbours, the French are not more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
A 2010 study by two researchers from CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not), France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.

In 2008, on 1.5 million controls, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 made for judgments of short duration were "unjustified or too long," 37 050.

<seg id="28">
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of cases "inadequate or unjustified" on 1.2 million, or 132 000.

We must legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts

Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.

Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Only 9% of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to this effect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
This is one of the conclusions of a report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this is done with a patient is found to be competent to take such a decision.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the world.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
If Canada is ranked 10 th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
And despite the wish that most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Overall, the country, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths at the hospital.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report comes to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalised or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e., the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not consented.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
On the contrary, said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, we would have many more cases of these excesses specifically in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not permitted.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Canadians support euthanasia
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
It should be recalled that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow persons at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled persons has less value.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
For those who assisted suicide, the surveyed feel 41% that they should not be pursued.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
In terms of maintaining or cessation of care for a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be included in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal legally valid is not a criminal.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals are trained to the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Finally, in terms of palliative sedation or terminal, already widely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same procedures.

Immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles -engorgement police, judicial and administrative subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "countries of human rights" of France.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
More recently, it is administrative harassment for foreign students who was in the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming that France "has no need of foreign talent, masons and restaurant servers."

But it is rarely analysed in economic terms.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">

</seg>
<seg id="6">
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who said in 1976 that "900000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers," and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the poverty in the world in 1990.

For the two sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and society.

<seg id="10">
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we only be prepared to grant towards immigrants.

<seg id="12">
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be charged electorally; but it is economically very costly.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
As the recall economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, pp. 352), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, salaries and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may be a substitute for national workers, particularly the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their wages.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes to domestic wage earners, for most of the trades in areas of shortage of employment.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Immigrants low-skilled work in areas that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic in which training is not following the availability of jobs.

In the same way as a surgeon will be difficult to work in a country that suffers a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the arrival of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of national.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows resulting in an increase between 0.6% and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.

And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among the Nobel Prize American; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).

Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.

The International Labor Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over the whole of his life.

"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon opening this pipeline, demonstrating how close the major gas contracts are also political and economic.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
All this explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of gas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The submarine is steel wrapped with concrete to protect against the anchors of vessels.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
For the building, it was necessary to avoid areas of mines from the Second World War.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It took the measures to protect the flora and fauna.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
The tube is a long snake to heavy metal, such as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing stops along its entire length: neither valve, or station maintenance.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
A platform of control was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project have renounced while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Crown corporation Russian permanently off their coasts.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the event of a leak, the gas content in the pipeline is therefore in the air.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have provided the welds for a leak every 100 000 years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Monitoring the condition of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for external monitoring, as well as a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Of the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, large one metre in diameter, and it is driven by the gas.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 metres, the second book detailed information on the potential distortions of the metal.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The pipeline was designed to operate fifty years without the slightest compensation.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The gas flow is simply provided by the pressure.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It is 200 bar at the outset, and 100 on arrival.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Five companies have joined forces to this project.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Have joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and French GDF Suez group (9% each).
</seg>
<seg id="41">
These five companies have created a joint venture, named Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Gazprom has then leased to the company, for twenty years, all of the gas transport capacity.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of gas really transported," says Jens Müller.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
The funding of the construction of the pipeline was 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
But the minority shareholders are safe to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
The pipeline is emerging from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted pine.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the exit door of the gas.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature, and the specific characteristics of the gas that is, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas for each hour that passes.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.

<p>
<seg id="3">
It has an air of adventures, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its coverage, its rectangular black elastic, the leaves of a colour off-white, as aged by time.
</seg>

However, the Moleskine as we know it today... Was born in 1997.

The book is based on a former technical production, the mole skin (skin of Townsend) which means a cotton varnish used to cover benches for example.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This type of book was very popular writers and travellers.

<seg id="10">
"New updated version of an old and forgotten, who was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for the mark in modo simple.

<seg id="12">
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.

It is far from the production version of the early years, where only 3 000 books were designed.

It distributes its books in bookstores, the small shops downtown and has been able to impose its identity.

"We have followed the spirit of the times and this need new writing, despite the growth of e-mails," says Maria Sebregondi.

This signature cultural accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched a "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own book.

In August, it has also launched a leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.

Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers is so high?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
About 19% of people with disabilities are in search of work.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Despite a proactive policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Discouraging?
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association which organises the week for the employment of disabled. "
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"The progress made since fifteen are considerable."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"It is still a great deal to do."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, many barriers still exist prior to employment.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
They are older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average).
</seg>
<seg id="12">
They have a level of qualification: 80% have not tray and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In short, as many criteria that are making the return to employment, and that is the crux of the problem, "according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Springboard, an association established in 1992 to help companies to recruit workers with disabilities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
So much for the brakes objectives.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The rest unsaid, attitudes are changing that, yes, but too slowly.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre Precinct indicated that managers surveyed have "low levels of knowledge of disability," with a "over-representation of people in wheelchairs, deficient mental or intellectual."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Outcome, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employment of 6% of workers with disabilities, set in a law of... 1987.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The latest figures available, dating from 2008, point to a ratio of 2.6%.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre White, Director General of the;, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with the law.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The evidence: the number of institutions "taxed," just as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre White. "
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"But this improvement also reflects a real gesture of awareness, especially in large groups."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ workers with disabilities, against 82% of businesses in 100 to 199 employees.

Hazard: "That of happiness'

Prior to face the Blues on Tuesday evening (20 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure that provides this friendly match.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It will not go so far as to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.

Sitting together on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
</seg>

Five months after the mood of his attacker against Turkey, the breeder Belgian has high praise to do about it.

"I have to take my marks."

Portugal very confident

<p>
<seg id="2">
Portugal's Paulo Bento begins with many of its optimistic dam return with regard to Bosnia (22), on Tuesday in Lisbon.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The move, the two teams had been realistic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Paulo Bento is already, in Poland and Ukraine.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
For him, there is not a shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which is to throttle since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But there is a match to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to destabilise.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears clear that the games are not facts.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Portugal has dominated the party for more than a hour, but he was unable to score that goal if valuable, which would have relieved.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
"It is a good result, which is not without some risk because we don't have the goal out"
</seg>
</p>
<p>

But at home in their light the Stade de Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced of, before an audience that should also be boiling, even if the party is obviously "very tight," by one Bento optimistic but lucid.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"We expect a very tight game, but we are quite confident to take over," said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," has put the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The zero reported Friday in Bosnia requires the Portuguese to mark and win.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
No one may be sufficient to Bosnians, which also need to mark.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"It is a good result, which is not without some risk because we do not have to purpose outside," Bento regret.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualifications," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention of entry to a maximum of pressure on the Bosnians to "not to give them time to think."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A good idea, provided to be realistic, this time.
