<seg id="1">The diet of a child obese: do not take breakfast and takes the sausages for the dinner</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">More than a third of children ranging in age from 9 to 13 were overweight, 9 per cent of écoliersont an above-average weight and 5 percent are obese.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the current research shows the obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">This shows once again how important is the environment in which the human being and operates the models.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the tables of obese children examples of the sausages 50 percent more often than among families with children in normal weight.</seg>
<seg id="6">19 percent of obese had chips for dinner in the survey with advocacy "obesity is not a random"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">For the families of the small big sport is also not a habit now, which is the case for most of today's schoolchildren, only 15 percent said that at least once a week, the Movement's parents found the time for active.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Investigation on 900 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 students participated in primary schools in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was the second edition of "obesity is not a random," sustained efforts by the Assembly and the health insurance company.</seg>
<seg id="11"> From the beginning it has more than 12,000 students in sixth at the third who signed up for the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">One of the key factors that cause a dramatic rise in the number of children who are overweight or obese, is the lack of proper food and lack of physical exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"only half the children questioned notes, for example, eat five times a day small déjeuner-en cases - lunch - goûter- dinner, which is the basic principles of good food," said one of the results of the investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Without breakfast and sausages at dinner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The experts stressed the fact that for a healthy development it requires some basic details such as a breakfast at home at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of the students eat at my same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In the majority of families each takes his breakfast alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the worst thing that has been identified is only a tenth of the population does not take any of breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="19">The breakfast is the basis of a good food daily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The survey has shown that in families of obese children are consuming more often unhealthy chips.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drink every day of sugary drinks (70 per cent).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">More than 40 per cent of the children questioned the sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Prepares you tone food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another part of the survey gave children selected (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from choices according to their own taste and their personal opinions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"the preferences of Czech children of 12 to 15 years are far, to plan for a healthy diet, the ideal."</seg>
<seg id="26">Among their favorite dishes, there are many cakes, meats and mills.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the most alarming is such a big favour the sugary now," is shown in the results of the investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For lunch they are pasta which have taken the lead just before the white meat.</seg>
<seg id="29">The children have no wanted starches and preference for fish and vegetable meal was very low.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The designer must also be a good psychologist, say professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In an article for presentation on the way to learn for the designers, I started a little angry because there were many from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="3">I never thought to what would happen after that.</seg>
<seg id="4">The presentations of three professionals of specialty, the clothing of characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">As we approach the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even when it is a matter of course on Saturdays and Sundays is truly "packed."</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we have with the Director alenka (over there was no boy) Treaty in the way we dress the woman without a measurement standards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And the women of this type is the majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">One has a small neck, the other of a boy, without curve, another of overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The designer should know how presentationally ammenuiser arms wide, prolonging a neck or curves up necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We arrived and nicely to emphasize the figure and also not to pay too much of a conspicuous of types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong breast and pelvic delivered and a fine size.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If there is such a difference between the size and the HIPS so that the skirts or trousers are not at all, it is the blow to the face.</seg>
<seg id="14">And you will regret not because the clothing which falls neatly is invaluable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In a skirt on a position you feel much better than that in shifting, enroule time and does not involve the belt and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For those with a male appearance have can afford a clothing style Tucker, with pieces of tissue conjured, or embroidery.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Naturally, there are many other examples of appearances and I am happy that I have all week to sort through all the information.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I also fear that in light of what I should do at home there too.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each trainee got a celebrity to dress for day and evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to take into account the current appearance, the kind of mode of the personality, and his appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I have to "pay" Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know of the Victoria's secret campaign.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At the back of my mind, it is a pleasure, because it is better than clothing to Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently been almost 100 kilograms (do not take my statement, SVP, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">We must cut and sew from magazines or look on the Internet, printing and work the graphics.</seg>
<seg id="24">The moodboard, as we say in the end result, expresses our personal style and our relationship with the establishment figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Also reflect on the party's graphical styling is also important.</seg>
<seg id="26">The designer cannot and only the physical but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on specific commodities trends for handbags, the coats, etc).</seg>
<seg id="27">Mario kamenik, designer and artist, we have talked to all this.</seg>
<seg id="28">But this,... until Sunday</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The designer has a vision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Three guests of specialty gave a diversified aspect to Saturday's meeting filled with information on the different types of characters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub polanka fashion designer and Ben RENC, photographer of fashion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know the use.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a talented designer knows work with a single dress differently.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variability is paramount for this example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Such as the trench-coat which had to be increased from conventional way with a Jean and a T-shirt as a light coat but it also can clothe the naked body, with escarpins and taking the photograph as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or it enough to roll up the sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look.</seg>
<seg id="37">"play with this," he stressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But I especially enjoyed the following advice: "for the work you need to know the rules" perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="39">"then you can begin to break," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, I understand why it was trying to learn the rules, what to do with, where, why, while in the lifestyle magazines are sometimes seen something else.</seg>
<seg id="41">No statement on the fashion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer clothing must be more options than those photographed.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is to say that for fashion story to be a 10 pages (and thus a dozen models) I have to be ready for "retailler" at least a fortnight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also, clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">We must reckon with this in a creation of a model.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the succés has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna is not a super Singer but image and marketing have made him a star world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of designers still remains cautious.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the faces sometimes view them as necessary (it enough that I know something, but what I come through the second).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if someone is a styling from us, then we have to count on the fact that it teaches us with a high likelihood a completely different size (smaller) than he has in reality.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then we have to navigate on Google and ascertain whether the news of Boulevard are State of the celebrity, if it has lost weight or swollen etc...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Honza and Mario we have asked Sunday about the heart that it is not enough to to move in the fashion designer and assemble models.</seg>
<seg id="53">It needs to communicate with the people he dresses and it is so important to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">Know guess people, not to flatter, maintain its opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and the use of new elements you cannot just throw everything and say, 'My God! horror.</seg>
<seg id="56">"you will find few cases you find cute and that you do with what the focus," said Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It has shown us what must contain the so-called "placovka" or bag of designer.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is the one you fasten around the waist and that you on itself for all you need.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In addition to clear things such as scissors, the rollers on dépilation or pins to nurse, as well as nylon yarn (that the designer used to photograph of products such as bags, hats), special clips with which it closed a garment in the back, whether it is too much (the PIN or other staple are not utlisables because they could spoil the clothing) or a sewing kit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">For that we are not only of the people listening but have tried something so practice they have taught us how to accurately ressemeller shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">And during the photo in the workshop where the surface is equal, the shoe could spoil, let alone to lextérieur.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And so we have bonded and bonded.</seg>
<seg id="63">We did not receive the scissors for not getting hurt.</seg>
<seg id="64">It therefore really need skills.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario was good when he congratulated me for my generation.</seg>
<seg id="66">My comptence State is not for my girlfriend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a small summary of what we have learned in the second weekend of course</seg>
<seg id="68">I began to understand that making the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, for everyone to say what he wants.</seg>

<seg id="1">The need for speed the run competes across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Revision</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Originally a race without problem is due to a combination of mistakes stupid people who have nothing to do with a routine morning trip to work.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but is meaningless if nobody wants to do more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new party subtitled the run has produced great expectations before his release.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Government promised to take a new direction with the series of arms need for speed already playing a kind of old and out from the parties jouables which would come not just with points.</seg>
<seg id="7">So we were curious how will be the main added-on heroes in the fate of his car and does what it wants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As already in the series NFS, the result is completely different than atttendait.</seg>
<seg id="9">These are potentially racing games of arcades, but the whole suppresses because of some unnecessary mistakes which have existed for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are not really errors but rather an expression of idleness incomprehensible from developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">You are in the adventure whose main hero Jack has acute emotional problems and to resolve them is to participate in illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">You just behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco and your Mission is the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea has some interesting points.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.</seg>
<seg id="16">Which means that each race is on a different route and the steps in different environments which differ from each other quite well and are interesting.</seg>
<seg id="17">The player did not feel that the game offered something similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some environments are also fairly fine even if the technical chart is the same type that the earlier rounds.</seg>
<seg id="19">Finally, this is not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the actions across the desert in autumn landscape or in snow-covered mountains of high is very pleasant visually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The tests are in more from time to time interspersed with an unusual component.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm which you significantly reduced the visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then in the mountains, you must pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition to the different races are well arranged the one behind the other.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are only a handful of people, but that is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are some moments you seek to surpass the number of opponents (as in a conventional) then you chase race against the clock (classic duel with the timer) and then you still face another duel with an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">From time to time, you also the police entering the game and tries to make the situation reportedly rarely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The novelty is crossing outside the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is, rather, una interactive animated when most of the time Jack flees to someone and you must help the banging on the right button at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The surprise is that there are fewer moments of this type that what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">The result is that because it is not likely to affect and, in the background, in the elements that make up the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The code of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.</seg>
<seg id="34">Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary, but it does not appear to be negative.</seg>
<seg id="35">For the realistic simulation you go see elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But while we can find better in the conccurrence the type of conduct goes very well with the type of design of racing.</seg>
<seg id="37">So everything is OK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The problems began to emerge after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Has the diffférence's code of conduct, the crash has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="40">We do not expect this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how is your Auto, this is not completely good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">During tight overruns touch you sometimes mutually slightly but otherwise your auto part in voltiges mad.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or is in tatters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to restart system that is not really a problem but that you really riles.</seg>
<seg id="44">The restart is so that when you have broken the figure or you stepped into the scene the game you back under the last point on the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">But you only with 5 redémarrages.</seg>
<seg id="46">If you used the five redémarrages you repeat the game from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is more a tool, if something is not done properly, that you can really count on here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes the redémarrages do not and we must find a solution by remémorrant route from memory the piece in question.</seg>
<seg id="49">The major fault of this game is that the same actions were found in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">For instance, there was some disagreement that we must move from a certain way or it doesn't.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Otherwise you meet on a given location of vehicles "civilians" in the same way that you come first, fifth, five seconds ahead of or a minute late.</seg>
<seg id="52">What Angers the situations when you see easily slip the opponent between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you must either be put aside and the conturner or braking.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is if you go ahead of him because it was "calculated" in such a way as to the specific situation there always comes very close to your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents have other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="55">During the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without the time, and you always have the same opponent before you in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">This irritates the more at the end of the game when going on a long bridge in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The enemy must at all costs be heard before you.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it passes before you it obscures the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you go in collision a number of times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">It is understandable that the object of the game is to make something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you soon ennuyez.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is a shame, because through a simple code of conduct, the game is interesting and places with so many action that you do not have the time to follow everything that happens.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is if it is because of the unique concept of 50 routes, which the order of camel is that there are no chance of boredom or something else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The change is the brainchild of car during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must pay attention to the fuel pumps on the routes because you can change cars there most of the time that you enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sports cars are ideal for American cities, gas-guzzlers straight for highways and the super sports cars to exotic charms on the conducted very yaw techniques such as roads in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">And the challenges which are racing in specific areas that you know of adventure, is fine with the regime's main story.</seg>
<seg id="67">You get not only the medals but also the experience points to add to your profile that is common to the challenges and the adventure.</seg>
<seg id="68">When you have reached the highest level of driver, number beginning to unlock.</seg>
<seg id="69">It connects on-line with the function autolog which among others compare your results with those of other players and you provide other functions in the community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the more difficult to understand is the situation blows in the last race of the adventure.</seg>
<seg id="71">You get with your car in the subway tunnel (it is) where you unlucky in the dark on the way (it smacks).</seg>
<seg id="72">Your speed indicator you said between 150 and 200 km / hour (presumably) and you get a subway train that you send the car directly on the scrapheap.</seg>
<seg id="73">Has the editor we discussed for several days to know if anyone has ever considered the creators of this game or if they really take us for fools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side of the game is not extra visual, but the party is generally pleasant and in some cases really Super.</seg>
<seg id="75">What annoys is only in extreme situations, the imagery is not the level and in some cases dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="76">This is true of the accident with a large number of participants when imagery fluid does you no good anymore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The sound is good and the track is the choice.</seg>
<seg id="78">In order to please the largest number and particularly the most noise for a young audience a new track has been established in the style "I mixing everything," but it can be expected that nobody will buy the stake to the music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">General impression of need for speed: the run is really confused.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game had not these stupid mistakes we can safely say that it is the best of NFS production in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But this game gives the sense of not being finished.</seg>
<seg id="82">The amusement is really good, but prepare you for what it gets you in the eye with the force of a reflector airfield.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Czechs are behaving like négativistes and Euro-sceptics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The Treaty of Lisbon has drastically cut the balance between the institutions'</seg>
<seg id="4">"I did not expect to a war as hard."</seg>
<seg id="5">"It will take 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players are accustomed to their new role ', as miléna vicenova began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When she managed to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers of the Faculty of Law of the University Charles might envy, it revealed how she takes its motto "understandable and openly on Europe" very seriously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mrs vicenova has paid tribute to the work of Herman Van rompuye permanent, the new President of the European Council.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"from the outset resounded the criticism it is bland, a rond-de-cuir, that it cannot rempplir no mission and I must say that it has cut the impetus to everybody, because it takes its role to perfection."</seg>
<seg id="9">"This is a man who listened 27 Member States, good communication with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">She explained the new post of the High Representative for the common foreign and defence policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who's Who in the European Union?" "has what telephone call, so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater transparency of the policy of the Union faced with States, as is the China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky (cheese to paste cooked that feels very strong) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mrs vicenova also referred to the agenda which has lived, live and live in a time near the European Council.</seg>
<seg id="13">She called the Czech presidency two years ago of succés.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs have solved the mounting financial crisis, the gas crisis or had organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">She described the fall of gourvernement very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech Republic to the EU representation at this time is very busy.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of Ambassador, "the activity became prominent" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that still continues to be resolved now.</seg>
<seg id="18">There must also approve the new budget septimal who becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As it is, the budget will be thin and economies, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything has to be solved in the framework of future negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Madame Ambassador recalled its slogans with which she arrived in Brussels for a Europe 'understandable ."</seg>
<seg id="21">"I don't really like the abbreviations, foreign words, the jargons that nobody understands.</seg>
<seg id="22">As must understand the people that it is true that in Brussels person does gherkins rods or warped, banana differemment major or that nobody has prohibition on syrecky ."</seg>
<seg id="23">She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more of Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">A multi-speed Europe us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being the Eurosceptics and of people who see things that in their more negative than positive.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result, she said, a number of factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of intent and a little support from the party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Also the Czech Presidency to succés then stressed the force and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group.</seg>
<seg id="29">"believe me, when it comes to me, the Poles, the Magyar, Slovak, this French tells me: 'back, what you there and that is still the Visegrad Group?" and it is not at all happy ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">According to Mrs vicenova, in the near future that are new rules of tough fiscal policy that awaits the member countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, except at different speeds, rather than a "new European Federation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have countries in the euro zone and other" from the area.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."</seg>
<seg id="34">For starters, it was said that cooperation among countries that want it and those who do not wish to remain in their corner ."</seg>
<seg id="35">"There will be a lot of similar institutions and there will be a two-speed Europe," Mrs vicenova are expected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van rompuye to determine the basis by which all the issues that impact on the EU should be discussed among all members of the EU and not only the memebres in the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1">History of a trademark.</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovator IBM began the second century of his existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If someone should seek the banner which expresses the nearest to the IBM strategy, would be "the long term."</seg>
<seg id="4">For a wider audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet it has been 100 years since its establishment.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of the long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson SR.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has left this slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan 'believe'! "became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal newsletter that IBM began to publish in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">That was the basis of the corporate culture soignement developed by Watson.</seg>
<seg id="9">For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived one hundred years thanks to the fact that it was always true to its core values and however has not been afraid to change all the other around it.</seg>
<seg id="11">It gave us during our first century of transforming technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "a délaré for the anniversary the current Director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A clearly prepared</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after its own employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only among the first American workers to vacation pay, insurance paid by the employer over a uniform of employee elegant and well prepared a system of rewards for inventors and the commmerciaux.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the same way IBM has a well-prepared sytème relationships with clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company had initially brilliant in the discovery of talents- as one of the first companies to have removed any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.</seg>
<seg id="17">The current plan is completely in line with the strategy because it will be an anti-discrimination femme- Virginia rometty - which should replace Palmisano as head of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is working with IBM for 30 years and currently holds the post of Head of sales, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, the brain- storming in line until derive much of strategies for the future and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm for almost 500,000 people work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is the company's internal and external image that provide a secure position in the fields of business.</seg>
<seg id="23">"since the early IBM had a concept of institution, rather than of a technology company," said rosabeth MOSS kanter, a Professor of Economics at the School of Economics at Harvard and author of the book on IBM.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps to solve the problems in the world of business by using its technology," added geogre colony of the consulting firm Forrester research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and create this market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or the "Big Blue," as it is known colloquially in the United States, given its slogan- in 100 years it has grown up to become one of the world's largest companies.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is obviously the firm technological versatile - it is developing software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services for the server products until the Council nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">It has several patents of all US technology firms and five of its employees were awarded a Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among its findings stands for example the distributor of tickets, the credit card, the SWAp, the financial Bar Code or the diskette.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM has recovered this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technology firm, according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time in 1996 it above Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Overview in advance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is not every innovation and invention that took the preference of the client and the time - for example, IBM had not passed the bet on a own os / 2 operating system, the miracle online service or an IBM computer pcjr:</seg>
<seg id="33">"starting from the time when your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain ensconced on the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">For that IBM had no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it is.</seg>
<seg id="35">Unlike the example of conccurent Microsoft that at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">A technology perspective</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the IBM revenue, the services, which are trained for a fifth with software and hardwares, have a prominent place.</seg>
<seg id="38">But in 1990 she was with more of the motié in the highest representative of hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">After the year 2000 IBM has sold assets to at $15 billion, in cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the buying of technology opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="40">It continues in investments and even starting in 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM negotiates according to its first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who, during the Great Depression has also increased its investments.</seg>
<seg id="42">It appears now that IBM is the current crisis without incident?</seg>
<seg id="43">The share price IBM has progessé starting in 2008 in a rocket of 120 percent, the net profit of the company continues to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The company's logo IBM is to change everything, but not its values.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is reasonable to expect that the flexible giant master other crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM history: from the slices of cheese made up for flights in the cosmos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The company International Business Machines (IBM) was born in New York, a hundred years ago; it was originally the name of complicated computing tabulating recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">She took the name IBM in 1924 - originally it was a mark used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="50">They possessed the technology such as the old "pointeuses," the clock with the arrival and departure of employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was Charles ranlett flint that until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the society.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint embaucha the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The ITF then leader of the shadow to the founder of the firm, the Watson ideas that underpins until now the identity and the culture of the company.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson headed the firm kusqu' in 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name said, began with the production of all possible machines for business - trancheuses cheese and meat until cash registers.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years during which Watson headed, the turnover was redoubled to $9 million and began the company's expansion in all parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was unique to the company if that after 40 years of direction is the son who held the seat of Director, Thomas Watson Jr.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his direction IBM began development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s the people and the IBM computers helped NASA has guided the flights in the cosmos - on mercury, Saturn and the flight to the Moon in 1969.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM system / 360.</seg>
<seg id="61">The classic PC which determined the standard computer of the time with the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later IBM sells its computers factory in Chinese society Lenovo, but acheta the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to care for and services with a high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The successful strategy at IBM in the past three years - is the concept smarter planet "a more intelligent" planet.</seg>
<seg id="64">Its goal is the intelligent uilisation of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and urban management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the area of trade IBM has recently developed a platform "smarter" trade that helps trading manager at the trade round.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM also has a strong history in our territory.</seg>
<seg id="67">It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Now, besides IBM RT, there is also the center of strategic outsourcing of Brno.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The purchases</seg>
</p>

<seg id="5">Your half you made remarks that are dependent on shopping?</seg>
<seg id="6">Should you buy at least a garment in a week?</seg>
<seg id="7">You simply buying and over salary packages at the time?</seg>
<seg id="8">In your case we can talk about the purchases as a vice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Some women believe they should restrict their passion to make purchases.</seg>
<seg id="10">But you say, which responses to lèche-vitrine clothes shops, to seek for oneself of cute clothes and then tested all the booth at (the ideal of different colours)?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">And although for most women buy is a hobby, it could be for a living hell.</seg>
<seg id="12">You only remember how many times have you told your spouse simply wait to entry...</seg>

<seg id="19">You are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">This is not the case that you should stop to take care of yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complain about his appearance.</seg>
<seg id="21">The strong sex does not hesitate to say that increases the frequency of these complaints and more women become empoisonnantes.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How have evolved the fares since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Up in Czechoslovakia in 1989, there were only five State travel agents: cedok, sporturist, ckm, rekrea and autotourist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agents at that time offering travel especially in countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to West was very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Czech Tourists traveled to the holiday in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, the Black Sea and Crimea in Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A major exception to the period from 1962 until 1972, when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have a propensity for West and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The great paradox of the socialist era was that the nétait not authorized for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovak) to travel even within the socialist countries individually.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the case where the Czechoslovak citizens to travel individually by example in Poland and the Soviet Union it needed a letter of invitation if not the individual travel was not allowed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agents at that time also offered trips to the West, however it is important to wait all night with a sleeping bag or have a "knowledge" in the travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">And even after that there was still a long way to go.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agreement for the currency which was vital to travel West was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The currency Czechoslovakia was not tradable, however, and it was not possible to obtain resources without the agreement of Western currency (currency) to travel to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Czechs often spent their holidays in the country where there were so many summer homes and chalets that the Czechs had bought and usually lasts until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The travel of Czechs have since been great since 1989.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Although until 1989, the holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria were up to, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries all over the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the country is Croatia's most popular when it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries in the West have caused an enormous wave for short visits mainly in Vienna in Austria and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czechoslovak could not long travel by plane to the West that everybody wanted to see at least a moment.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example in Paris tour were the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income does not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The typical feature of Czech travel itself at this time to prevail with its own Food Canning, sausage, etc... to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which has enabled our tourists finally after decades of Western be free to buy the currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and that the average wages have risen which caused around the year 1997 another important point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with of air charters, which runs through contracts have greatly reduced the costs compared to what it was before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">During the late 1990s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with the majority of developed countries of the world to join the US who later helped our travels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of tourism's, when was prepared the first charter flights to an exotic countries, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since this year, as every year of direct air charters are bringing the Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is more than exotic 100.000 Czechs who visit the country each year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Yet an interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our development's arrived in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The 17 November 2008 the had abolished visas for Czech tourists and has allowed our country to be completely into developed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history has spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50, 3 per cent) and for the first time in history has spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for a vacation abroad including utilities annexes. kroner per person.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The General Assembly must find its President, but it is likely to end with a situation without solution "a pat"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">So far, nearly 5mois Czech football is without President and it is likely that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly to be held Thursday in nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, there is still no agreement on what rules of vote to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without that agreement, it is not possible to vote for one of three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jindrich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomas paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hašek resigned in June and during his departure has called his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality to lead the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only during the era after Hašek Football came back into the differences between the Chambers of the association which fail to agree on a joint candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This has fully demonstrated the 16 September when it came to choosing a new President.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Assembly delegates met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because negotiation has been blocked and there has not even been issue to deal with how to elect.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the representatives also assessed and many staff members with full power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point there was a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance of the Office for the State and the law, that the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">The differences still remain on the rules for the election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its negotiation scheduled or special, added nothing to the situation</seg>
<seg id="14">Public opinion about the possibilitě have changed several times, but the problem still remains the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how can the third round to avoid falling into the PAT.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The bone of contention is the following: either investigate the statutes or find another model," was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the rules of model provided wins in the third round of candidates who received the most votes percentage in the House for which he is a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Moravia is ready as are said to withdraw so that wins the candidate who received the highest percentage of votes of two chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Czechs explores the condition that the winner would have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"only then it would lose the idea of two previous rounds and bicameral completely reject the concept," admits Svoboda which includes the objections of the Moravian and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the regulations in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is surprising that Tomas paclik is also agree even if it believed that the rules of the elections established under the statutes most pelta benefit among all candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I hope that we vote to the articles of association."</seg>
<seg id="23">"so that there is not yet an insane ideas conceived by a representative as in past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his talks mainly defined himself against pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future set and constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible today in European championship qualification should calm the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The football will once again on a wave of happiness and Aure more drive for a cooperation" adds the jablonec officer who among the three was the greatest soccer experience in leadership both professional and regional levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is very tense.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are some trends to change the regulations to drawing."</seg>
<seg id="31">"This can lead to a deadlock at the General Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that the sound reason will prevail" rajchl said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">There is not much time left for a joint agreement to all parties.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the entire leadership of football will be full for the match.</seg>
<seg id="35">The specially chartered flight in which must travel to podgorice inter alia the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and rajchl, has not been lifted for technical reasons and it sought an alternative to keep a part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">At the end it was the Ministerial Meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be decisive.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Joseph dobes would be very happy to receive the warring parties in the sports association the highest in the country and encourage them to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the game there are many: a State allocation, the credibility of the football and also the General Assembly of the European Czech sports, which must determine the direction of the Czech sports after the financial problems of sazka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclik is off to fight for the post of President, because he saw no candidate correct.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the Chief of footballers of Plzen Tomas paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile has responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (afrt) it would not campaign for this high office.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If there is such a candidate I supported it, I fight for him and I do not come to the election."</seg>
<seg id="42">"but in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," said paclik to the Czech News Agency (KTC).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The motivation of paclik is to compete with Miroslav pelta and Jindrich rajchl to try prevent pelta access for the leadership of the afrt that apparently would be given favourite for this election.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclik also emphasizes that mean the elections he would keep the post of Chairman only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He is keen in high-level civil and experienced a manager but is not linked with the world of football.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I talk with people who have the profile," he says.</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me this has been a terrible when some said they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."</seg>
<seg id="48">"I would like to change that image," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">That, say, discomfort paclik above all is the relationship between pelta and the President of the Union's regional football of Plzen Roman berbr, rights to the controversial reputation who is known in the wings as lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="50">For paclik it is not acceptable that pelta occupies the position of President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If they win, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."</seg>
<seg id="52">"and with the support of berbr, who is a business, it would be less favourable to football," proclaimed paclik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What worries the still is the fact that the name of pelta was pronounced in tapping a few years ago as part of an investigation into a bribery scandal, for whom's pelta has emerged without penalty.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what prestige pelta would soccer."</seg>
<seg id="55">"and how are seen in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said paclik, who said some time ago "if pelta becomes President, I sell the Club of Plzen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the case where paclik will come out to Thursday's vote, it would have to prove that it could cooperate with felta.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, think the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (pelta) would be the first with which go."</seg>
<seg id="59">"It was a big capacity"</seg>
<seg id="60">"he would be able to show by example as head of the representation.</seg>
<seg id="61">"but as manager of the Association" it would not be able.</seg>
<seg id="62">"I keep my nose into what I do not know," said paclik which in September has attracted much attention when they voted for the cancellation of the Commission of arbitrators with ludek macela that has replaced Dagmar damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclik argues that it would be at the level to lead the association.</seg>
<seg id="64">It takes such as its capacity to lead private firms and that he also directs since last year the Club of Plzen who celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the premier division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the muscle to change anything in the world of sport and to provide a certain culture."</seg>
<seg id="66">"I freinerais the influence of some interest groups that have, for example, tend to affect the Disciplinary Commission and appeal, which leads to bad taste," added paclik which chache not his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel kretinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">It would also consider a closer relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power to lobby to high-level policy would generate for the sport more tax money on games.</seg>
<seg id="68">"This is one of the key points that the new President should be."</seg>
<seg id="69">"for the tax on gambling as the State political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also tell where the money goes," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paclik does not do its existing link with the club of Plzen as something negative even if he claims that the President of the afrt should be "above the parties."</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is further linked with jablonec and rajchl with dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">I see no reason to pass on my actions of Plzen club to someone if I must return a year and a half later, "said paclik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised a new constitution for the afrt which should bring an end to the situations of Pat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of presidential candidate Miroslav pelta has promised that if he is elected, the afrt will have new regulations that should end in the future to squabbles over the rules for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="76">The jablonec officer is before the Thursday meeting in nymburk very optimistic that the succés today of the representation of football should alleviate this squabble before the vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta before the election in September, which has not been specifically promised to devote themselves to the national representation and the availability of financial resources if elected.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was decided to be a candidate at the last minute just before the General Assembly and the past two months could well lead to defend its vision of the direction of the football and to present it in a broader context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"people at all levels have long been of football and expect that the President" Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="80">"they feel that this is the best time for leadership of the Association, he adds," but it is linked with the club of jablonec, has worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="81">This is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that the problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed at lépoque of Ivan Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately in the General Assembly in June of the regulations had been approved not perfect as all were found."</seg>
<seg id="84">"If there were not all these various interprétattions we would already have a President since September," said pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It is precisely the revision of the most important document in the civic association, which has taken the full attention of the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I go President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibility if it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="87">"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," added pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Then it, apparently, of avoiding his opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">He has said previously that he can work with Jindrich rajchl that he admits in his legal training and it knows that his adversaire-candidat would be its first Vice-President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">He did not attack long tonas paclik who instead continues to criticize pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">"It develops in the football for a year and has already had some succés."</seg>
<seg id="92">"his attacks, however, were not the most honorable and has surprised many people" during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="93">"that is also why some have now doubts about his character," said pelta to his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the declarations made in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">Its most powerful weapon is said to his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level to the national réprésentation.</seg>
<seg id="95">This should be a vitirne of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"and I also efforcerais to complete all the cases that began with that of bohémians or very the corruption scandal."</seg>
<seg id="97">"I would be entering into negotiations with the private and public sector so that we can achieve enough money for any football," told the Czech News Agency the KTC 46th candidate two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">He also added that his appointment to head the football would only bring no change in people.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I should get to know all the employees," he said at strahov with understandable nervousness since there is no direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Although there are catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believed that the delegates will not go to nymburk for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="101">"There is a single point of discord over how to vote in the third round when we reach the Excel."</seg>
<seg id="102">"football has need of credibility and it will not get that when there is with a new leader," as said of optimistically pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a public official.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promised that under his leadership the afrt would begin working hard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">"If the current Vice-President Jindrich rajchl was elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that does not suit to large numbers of people, apparently.</seg>
<seg id="105">However, rajchl promised that if he is elected starts to work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">It seeks to make systemic changes and Executive Committee members are responsible for different areas of football.</seg>
<seg id="107">It also promised to settle the case bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, the football more money and continue the work started by his predecessor Ivan Hašek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"as President I am deal of football as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="109">"international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, of professional football and of an efficient football for youth."</seg>
<seg id="110">"but I am not saying that I will do that alone 'rajchl said in an interview for KTC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and want to have the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member" focuses on a specific area.</seg>
<seg id="112">"and I want difficult missions for football as a great step forward."</seg>
<seg id="113">"a lot of people are not happy, because it will begin to work hard rather than criticize the other" he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">It reported, apparently, that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="115">"a connection to me, know that I worked 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"but I need to know if this is the coup, and if I have some people behind me that I will constantly in the foot and issue doubts on each of my actions," explaining why his reluctance.</seg>
<seg id="117">"a lot of people have told me that I should not abandon, because they would also."</seg>
<seg id="118">"CSTA a confidence that I cannot fail," he says.</seg>

<seg id="120">"for the last two years there has been a great work of fact and I will not let it fall."</seg>
<seg id="121">"there are processes that have been launched that will impact in some years and I would not like to see someone stopping them.," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hašek.</seg>

<seg id="131">As Tomas paclik, President of the Club in Plzen, entered in the competition for the post of President, rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I sense an ongoing support of the Czech Chamber that has elected its Vice Vice-Chair and knows that with me there will be some succés," said rajchl which envisages among its future succés to save tens of millions of kroner on contracts disadvantageous, contract negotiations with TV and on the Gaming Act.</seg>

<seg id="1">The most beautiful swimming pools of Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A leap into the blue</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Of Mr. Julia Stanek</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Wading in view of magnificent ovni, swimming pools of Budapest: who travel through the blue can be Europe's miracle - and after looking the city or made a long promenade- may hinge its legs tired in the carbonated water baths.</seg>
<seg id="5">A book shows how swimming pool you can experience the greater well-being.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris meder research will travel during the past 18 months, there is one subject that should not fail in his luggage: a bathing suit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lying on his back in the water, it OBSERVA the project cupolas artistically arranged, and Europe against the marbles Putten waiting on the other side of the pool and had to admire the Art Nouveau meticulously restored of these pools converted.</seg>
<seg id="8">If a swimming pool was her happy, she noted in his book without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian meder and it had presented them in his book published: "badefreuden (joys of bath." The municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the Palace of historic bath in the Black Forest, "hardcore" concrete buildings in the Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It has conducted its "trips to the bathroom the most exceptional of central Europe" in 13 countries in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The German 46 years is a true expression of the culture of the bath.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meder, explains that she has little interest in the sport but ELL feels drawn to the water in a completely different way.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is frustrating that fans of the swimming are forced to confront the blue tiles and live with the stench of bleach while the joggers inhale the aroma envoûtant forest of spruce or can listen to the trill of merry birds in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"one day I wondered why the pools should in fact be always if laides" said the Viennese.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I began making a collection of fine baths."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The surface of the water strengthens doubling the architecture</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">A diving into a swimming pool and the volatile oils sauna, a factor of welfare in the swimming rooms are enormous because all the senses are awake, according to meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builders would have given a little more death, rooms to swim could be a true sheer delight for the eyes: "instead of a floor there is a surface water" in the halls of swimming.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the building as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="20">All surfaces are optically in a double: voûtes high, tiling mountainsides, springboards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The volume of image of small format "badefreuden" is a worthwhile report of 190 pages in the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of welfare historic, it certainly gives desire to take a leap in the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The art-collecting meder found remarkable copies during its research in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alongside the baths of welfare splendid as the bath Ltd in Budapest 100 years old, it was water containing natural in a cave in the karst (bath of cave in miskolc-tapolca) and a bath of spas by the basins filled with water containing the alkali and (városi termálfürdö in jászberény) and within a building in form of bottle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">By contrast, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria appears to have any dramatic views while, on the roof of the bath in Zurich was the entire city to her, you can admire the Arlberg earth-shaking changes from an external swimming pool of the snow-capped St. Anton: the Turkish bath has a window from which to observe the animation on the ski trail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most extraordinary of swimming pool design looked swimmers in längenfeld: the Aqua dome ötztal resembles a ovni who has just landed in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">In winter, steam amounts of three open shelves, while in the background are the ötztal mountains to the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The smell of bleach does not come from all the pools meder collection.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal baths are a smell of sulfur, árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba is a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, would be a health SPA.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell is therapeutic alkaline water containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black, and Limon you glue to the skin as soon as you let slide into the swimming pool, SPA experience special.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">During its pursuit of beautiful swimming pools, IRIS meder has also suffered disappointments: when she wanted to visit ADB luhatschowitz free external, a swimming pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, it was faced with a ground blockaded.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bath designed by the architèque Dusan jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">By casting a glance out the window of the immeuble-art again in rouge-blanc-jaune, she noted the growth of weeds between tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It was a charming effect in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palace of baths of ADB wildbad.</seg>
<seg id="35">The building has already survived three phases; not only elements can be discovered néo-romains leaving since its conception in 1844 but still a Moorish Hall in Alhambra style that has been added to it in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since its careful modernization of 1995, the Palace thermal bath remains the favorite of wet expert, IRIS meder - and not just because she is from schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This is already a nice return than to merge construction styles so different in a unit so wonderful," said meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.</seg>

<seg id="25">"It matters little, for Mr Ackermann, if it was a question of people starving or if Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">21st home in Vienna</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The flag, which moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Of Ingeborg wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A history of architecture with ups, downs and a happy ending: the Austrian flag for the global exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 (prizes, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty, then fell in ruins.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now it is to reopen in place of House of exposure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If there is enthusiasm for a postwar modern architecture to its clear forms, its hangars in glass, its strong and bold shapes and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in the technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 in is a good and famous example.</seg>
<seg id="7">The flag of schwanzer was once the "architecture" for its Grand Prix construction steel and glass, slight and suspended.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction is considered up to our days as an important step in the contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has made the architects if celebrities, it has also built the Austrian flag for the universal exhibition next.</seg>
<seg id="10">With its legendary home in four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in form of BOL in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its draft flag as a temporary construction had been briefing after Swiss Expo in the garden at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962, a museum of the 20th century opened -</seg>
<seg id="12">But the building was not physically and technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, it has been so long used, until the contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and has increasingly dilapidated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf krischanitz has transformed the flag, it now carries the name of "house of the 21st century" in the future, and will be used as a museum for contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tuesday night the Belvedere Palace Museum opened, which makes the House, the first exhibition, a stroke of luck at any point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The start has been completed by Agnes husslein-arco, which has become the new Director of the Austrian gallery in 2007 Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-arco, has promoted an art historian with a significant career between other in his youth of patineuse artistic, subsequently Sotheby's home, the Guggenheim Museum and as Founding Director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, particularly in many alterations to the politicians and the protection of monuments, it has secured funds public and private sponsorship and established the exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Except for the contemporary art, works of the sculptor Fritz wotruba including the foundation bearing the same name have been exposed, a coffee and a bookshop is found, and an office must be built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict monitoring, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the achievement krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that the flag was "an extremely important position" place where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the original plan, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and its change of use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">During the current changes, there were major problems: the building "was" an abyss in energy, "said krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The profiles of window glass facades were changed, the insulating glass fibre reinforced glass was laid and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">The girder thermal bridges have been built or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements have made room for the new operation, a space screen light retained between home and road lighting, provides a bridge leading to the entrance, it is almost a new construction, but always the slight flag schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">The outside doors of origins are gone, the House is painted in a protection against rust hue of colour rouge-brun.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all under close supervision by competent authorities for monuments and a small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"often cheaper materials that are good and should be found, and that also appeal to the Office of the monuments' protection, said krischanitz and drew attention to a gross floor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the problems, the constraints and transformation, the edifice was flexible and light.</seg>
<seg id="33">It would have been difficult with the flag, "which came from Brussels," said krischanitz recently, a typical story of "drop-in-the-city."</seg>
<seg id="34">Such a structure is "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "awaken the good conscience."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">But in this case, the home of the 21st century is in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck for urban construction: around the garden Switzerland is precisely the "district of the central station" any newly planned, with offices and apartments.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another stroke of luck might happen: the home of the 21st century could benefit from the support of another construction krischanitz, because the art-collecting Francesca von Habsburg Berlin has purchased the temporary Art Centre, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city for a site in the vicinity of the Swiss garden.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">After the discovery of the so-called zwickauer cell "the Turkish media about the state of German law.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper speaks of a "bloody" ideology, to be new to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following that announcement, Turkey, as well as the Turkish-German population meeting reacts with fear and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="6">As many germano-turcs the spectrum has long thought dead reared its ugly head: since the inflammatory attacks of mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there was more violence comparable with the context of right-wing extremist against the Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been discussed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The network of right-wing extremist identified with, however, reveals the proportions which is far from being predictable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"This is a return to the bloody ideology '," was the title of the publication on the Internet Turkish daily "haberturk."</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper Sabah "stresses, however, that one of the authors is said to have been a v-homme of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the quagmire of extremists.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a reasoned that the Turkish community in Germany have responded: she called this weekend in a silent commemoration to victims of racial violence in the Brandenburg Gate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community of Berlin and the German political and Turks have thought at a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the recruitment agreement germano-turc.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is with gay that cohabitation in pornography, symbolizing a story of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The reports of some Turkish media are a slap effect: "the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary," that is the title of an article in the Platform turque- "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of killings.</seg>
<seg id="15">The German also published "Hürriyet" has no compunction to draw clear conditions.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it begins to puer" was the title of the Chronicle of Ahmet külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">He pointed out that people have been murdered, allegedly paid taxes and have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">The police action was seen as very critical about forums germano-turcs and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Why he is not come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities to search suspect in some quarters of the extreme right wing, is a surprise authors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people are willing to at least drastic means rhetorical even: "If the case continues to be botched, the only option left to migrants nothing other than self-defense and arming."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will be the best self-defense."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writing "selen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photograph of the ruins after the burning of Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory German and Turkish.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a credible threat, and Germans, on which the mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could result.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, the attacks have intensified the feeling of the US in the Turkish community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Never repeat the mistakes of the past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Once it is especially the failure of German policy after the attacks that the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of mölln.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Bank scandal in Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Bank most adventure of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and patina meanwhile from one crisis to another.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a German who now must work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his departure from the head of the Bundesbank, learned in July that it would in 2013, a post almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss Bank UBS, which was a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its strength recently obtained and conveyed kind of comments on the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The UBS had achieved the turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">And yet, by the month of September, it was clear that everything would change.</seg>
<seg id="11">A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all security systems of the Bank and had jumped around 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The head of the Council of Administration of the UBS Oswald grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is seen as suffering from - and all ask: when Axel Weber is finally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">We have already learned that Weber may be advised of the Bank in February, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will resume the executive presidency already in May - not by 2013, as has been reported by the Bank on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker, much more Professor of economy and President of the Bank, and it would certainly have needed an adjustment period.</seg>
<seg id="18">In one fell swoop we assume the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has still to prove once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest bank in Europe" scandal.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, on the one hand the UBS is enormous, until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it patina for years from one scandal to another.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, has spared the so proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It began during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the Swiss manager of assets, silent and solid, but crafty, she had combined with the ambitious goals: it also wanted to be, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank.</seg>
<seg id="24">Therefore the UBS operated on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, it came as an investment bank in the League of the world's largest banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This made sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker Hans Geiger and later a professor of for many years in Zurich Bank says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good Bank before my students'.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In the current context, the question is: how do I could simply wrong to me?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It was deeply wrong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, it appeared for the first time that something was amiss at UBS.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year the President Peter wuffli withdrew in surprising ways, which was previously regarded as a high intellectual as well as a terrific banker.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later it was questioned why he was gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Division of the Bank had soared with the sub-prime documents and to give up billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of $13 billion francs and made a cross over.</seg>
<seg id="35">For this she was actually found investors, but who, shortly before, reportedly among eyebrows: a background of Asian State non-transparent from Singapore and a background of Arab State, which was ignored, to the point that no one has ever even heard his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">However, this is the first shot.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April it has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Bank was to announce new losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees Marcel ospel, still in 2006 the second Executive Council the better pay of Switzerland, to resign.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October, the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its errors, investment in the financial crisis before the crash and had to be rescued by the State.</seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank has bought at the UBS tens of billion of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for in convertible bonds, for which it might become co-owner of the Bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Throughout Switzerland has been shaken - because she noted how this could be disastrous for a small country, to host such large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the total assets of the UBS 2007 S "rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).</seg>
<seg id="43">"We could not save the UBS once again," said the researcher at banks, Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">After the first disaster as a follow-up to the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with the United States and has agreed to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who defrauded the tax, perhaps with the help of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine plus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And the UBS has more or less published it helped to tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital to compete with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">He followed the withdrawal of the head of the Governing Council and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of customers' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And in a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in the two main business: investment banking sectors because of bad speculation and asset management because of tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as had been thought, that UBS would manage, he followed in this unfortunate history of merchants of title: a single trader in a flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank not to understand that something was amiss.</seg>
<seg id="54">And being published: with risk management in investment bank that still does not seem to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"with the case Adoboli, it was found that the risks to too little," said Martin Janssen, economist and Professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">As the chief financial officer of a major German bank is safe: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not have" the risks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss Bankers had long taken office, that to become caretaker of the world's great fortune: not too much risk, but the security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of an entrenched reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a chocolate worthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The Central of the UBS in Zurich goes hand in hand with the strong metaphor of the Swiss Bank closed - it is only a little larger.</seg>
<seg id="60">Already the classic situation is.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its headquarters at the railway station in Zurich, which led directly to the central station at Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped mountain Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings are here, the rental stores are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">The jewellers as tiffany' S, midway between the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the confectionery Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">Swiss Bankers have lived here for centuries: of the National Bank to the Palais du Credit Suisse to private banks elitist as Julius bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">You arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside, the walls are lined with marble, before there were thick leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the Bank, a major label for "safe."</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows the customer research here: security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The idea of the Swiss bank was eventually rejected the contract, or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank to find.</seg>
<seg id="69">He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, indeed all Swiss Bankers it also does business with the two major banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS became far too high, trouve-t' it - especially in investment banking, where there were also reports the Anglo-Saxons.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss do not have nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"Even so, they have long been adapted to the morals of Anglo-Saxon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed, this was the Anglo-Saxon which had changed the UBS investment bank, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime like Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The disaster has become apparent on 15 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="75">"on Wednesday the government coalition of small countries to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," the author Lukas hässig wrote in his book "the crash of the UBS '.</seg>
<seg id="76">With up to 68 billion francs, is approximately 45 billion euros, the politicians have agreed to save the bank from bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If we spoke with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank, which was already too large for the little Switzerland - and has consistently recorded an increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">What has helped is that the two banks prédécesseuses different from the UBS Bank completed: a rich, but in lethargy with strong point asset management in Zurich and already a poorer, but increasingly internationalized.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the international investment banks have been positively access to plenty of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS Group, and Marcel ospel, formerly President of the Governing Council.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that wuffli and ospel was a dream team," said the researcher at banks, Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very well in models and statistics, and ospel, the intuitive, blazed a path to the Summit with the learning of the Bank."</seg>
<seg id="86">But ospel has relied until the end to wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wuffli and probably would have committed a crucial error at the end: "he thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"It is tragic fall."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">The staff of the UBS remembers clearly the Leaders' meetings at which the head of the Group wuffli was always the same motto: dethrone Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The US Bank Investment Bank was the most powerful in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">It has ordered the "league tables" rankings, at that time, that have documented the success of banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">After all, the UBS wanted to climb to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps have already succeeded him.</seg>
<seg id="96">In case of currency and stock transactions it has played a very important role.</seg>
<seg id="97">The advisers, who had the responsibility, however, have stressed a weakness: in the operations of international banking interests, in the jargon "fixed income," there would be a huge difference from the biggest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS would have gaps in American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill this gap, UBS was embarking on an adventure, which has nearly cost him his life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, it is both the Bank itself and a core of investment management created before it in the sub-prime Americans who have invested.</seg>
<seg id="101">It was transformed into a massive machine that was packed and put the valuable papers based on mortgages Americans - but who has also retained the risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Even when other banks have long sought to disembark.</seg>
<seg id="103">"yet in the summer of 2007, while the US housing market was in flames, the UBS bought here," said Geiger, a banking expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">The larger the euphoria is over the fall is brutal.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after another has left, when to stop attempts proved more difficult than we thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">The posts in UBS became ejectable and are so far bancaux.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">The leader of the major bank has a nearly impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="108">He needs to find a strategy for a bank, to which all business models suggested have disappeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">The researcher, Geiger Bank already has an idea: an end to the investment bank, concentration in the property management, return to Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">But the Bank does not (yet) so far.</seg>
<seg id="111">But the Investment Bank must vigorously atrophy, as is clear so far.</seg>
<seg id="112">Next Thursday the Bank chief Sergio ermotti wants to present to the world its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">The Italian-Swiss age 51 was only supposed to be on an interim basis when the Bank was separately with surprise of his predecessor grübel.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, it has emerged: it must sustain the affairs of the UBS, reported Tuesday the Bank in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to make the investment bank in the mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">It cancels 3,500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But it is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Which is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">With which to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that "Axel Weber was certainly already raised.</seg>
<seg id="122">He said so far only publicly that it would try with his wife an apartment in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The next year.</seg>

<seg id="4">You will hear about them in detail in this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the mists of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a historian and journalist Swedish.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">He wrote a book out of the ordinary that he describes, with accuracy, as "a work of anti-histoire."</seg>
<seg id="8">It has some important treaty known names, or the famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book on what happened, because, as a "book outlining how it could look like it reflected the" feelings, impressions, experiences and moods ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"the beauty and sorrow" summarizes the experiences in time of war of 20 men and women more or less normal, on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanistes to escaladeurs, doctors, paramedics and sellers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Other prisoners of war, some will lose members become insane or lives.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives reeling here as the candles of a church: while some are exhausted, new ones are in conflict.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book by Peter Englund deviated from the traditional history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It gives the lie to the idea that the First World War is only by the terrible war on the western front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the beauty and sorrow" cleverly described other theatres of war: the Alps and the Balkans, the Eastern Front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers present in this book are under the hives; a spend Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This book is moving from the first page.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war permeates the lives of these people such a natural disaster such as a hurricane Katrina, which reeks of the cordite.</seg>
<seg id="20">When cannon shots ringing from afar, and that you are a mother at home, are you staying or fuyez-vous?</seg>
<seg id="21">That will come from anyway?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for the war.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Peter Englund, "the lack of evidence has been augmented by the assumptions, hopes and fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"the beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard stumpf, a young marine of the German High Sea fleet.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are mainly from memos, letters and other documents already published.</seg>
<seg id="26">The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small, isolated moments and details.</seg>
<seg id="27">Most view the deprivation and the ability to cope.</seg>
<seg id="28">In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "ersatz, everywhere ersatz."</seg>
<seg id="29">"coffee of replacement, false aluminium, imitation of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It continued on the food of replacement in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">He described the "meat made of rice cooked sheep crushed in fat (and finished with a false bones of wood); tobacco manufactured from dry skin and dried roots of potato;" wooden shoe soles.</seg>
<seg id="32">He claims that "837 alternative meats are registered in the production of saucisses. also 511 cafes of alternative."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are entering the honour and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognizes its own impulse to the savagery and says about the war: "you feel that, after all, that is what the men were targeted, rather than sitting in a comfortable Chair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there was no barbaric behind your shirt empesée and cloutée.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that nobody will notice or not pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="36">"when one is resigned to make sacrifices, we hope to have a public" he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, this is not comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other comments relate the decline of an old and new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict is becoming more and more a matter of economic competition" writing Peter Englund, "a war between the factories.</seg>
<seg id="40">It took the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiaire at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well-written and convinced ideologically, clothes well cut, which serves his butchery while seated behind a counter."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People Act in unexpected ways, all of that base of heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Peter Englund spoke of soldiers who tried to grab a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid it at the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"This is the most ridiculous in the trade of pus due to the gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and run for the body into the hope to finish at the hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"The more desperate the applicable to the eyes, resulting in a blindness to life '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of Swedish by Peter gross, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible, but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to the task of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of short scenes, it takes the way the war has "unleashed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution," an aversion to the religion.</seg>
<seg id="47">People start to wonder why they are a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, as "the great war and modern memory" (the Great War and modern memory) by Paul fussel, or "a West nothing new," Erich Maria remark, rather than complete.</seg>
<seg id="49">Peter Englund's book is a little conventional Pantheon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The end of the book is the worse I have read in a work non-fictionnelle.</seg>
<seg id="51">I can't divulge.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if he had emerged from his book, in your hands this page containing the list of people and burned with a match.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Union, which represents hundreds of school aid having lost their jobs last month plans to file a lawsuit against the City Wednesday to layoffs and unnecessary; the disproportionate impact is on the schools for disadvantaged students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the Union, 37th District Council, to try to reverse the dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred seventy school aid, coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the city's less well paid, have lost their jobs last October 7 Union leaders are compared these dismissals in a political campaign for not letting the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and would have allowed to close the budget gap last spring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The municipal authorities have strongly denied the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing of the City Council last month, the Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the dismissals were a part of the budget closed in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the Council responded, noting that the dismissals of school aid was "not specified in the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The officers of the 37th District Council have said they meet a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the proceedings on the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</seg>

<seg id="9">Dennis M. Walcott and the City Department of Education will form the party défenderesse. plaintiffs will be represented by eight laid-off women workers, all in black or Hispanic origin, like most educational AIDS who have lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city's Legal Department, said that the municipality has still not been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to an outline of complaints received by the New York Times, the Union backing on the number of layoffs in the schools in the poorest areas of the city to support its claim against unfair treatment, declaring that the poor schools would lose the most aid because of a regular underfunding.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mission: Congress reaches an agreement on the question of Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ultimately, it appears that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have reached an agreement on the issue of the uprising in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="3">It took a successful uprising, the capture and killing of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (- Massachusetts democrat, with Republican Senators John McCain (- Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut, applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the US troops for their "courage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is to honour the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been easy to date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, legislators of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the development of several resolutions to approve or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain have submitted a resolution to allow the limited use of American military forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bill was defeated by a wide margin bipartisan and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce funding for American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">The US Mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory legislature - the Congress upset enough to criticize the management of the Mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug from under the feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The indecision of the Congress has been overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli was killed by insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20 last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO mission was officially completed on October 31.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Senate can now act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "commends the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination in view of freedom" and "commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and professionalism" fantastic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to reach an irreversible and successful transition to democracy" in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new measure remportera-t-elle all the support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee or divisera-t-elle legislators as in June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The Senator and Chairman Richard D. Lugar (independent) opposed to the latest version.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the Capitol, the House will vote this week a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all congressional Republicans, and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measure, supported by the Republican Bob goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Goodlatte's amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate, and others are small variations of a precedent.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are at least 15 only to the House versions of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful to "control the federal spending."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to claim to be "The author" of such a measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The Law on the control of the budget (budget control act passed last August requested the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution endorsing the idea of such an amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress may serve, while Jose E. Serrano (Democrat, New York) want to lift the limit of two terms for Presidents.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As eager as the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.</seg>

<seg id="16">"We do not have any of the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon.</seg>
<seg id="17">"but it seems to be the only way to support us to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not seem grateful or in disagreement with the public they serve.</seg>
<seg id="19">They also recognize that the anger of revenantes troops from the Vietnam War was much worse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Thus, most of the conversations on the Mercy have rise in confidence among the veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">After the return of his two sons in the fight with the Marines, the retired Colonel mark Cancian has warned that the public would their service from two perspectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Some watching them with respect because they have been exposed to the insurgents and had travelled to distant lands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Others will ask whether "a veteran angry and violent lurks beneath the surface" said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">When seeking a job, he said, he felt that some individuals who were sending him the talks called for subtle way if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from battle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"When you raise the subject of the service, you have to negative impressions," said Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The military challenges, in part, from the American indifference towards the war.</seg>
<seg id="27">The victories are rarely praise from a country as familiarity with the army, which sees little direct benefit of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"as a nation, we do value more heroism in the same manner as in the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of suffering of a soldier.</seg>
<seg id="30">The troops have been recognized as the number of services endured periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injury.</seg>

<seg id="1">The armed response to the growing pressure to clamp down on rapists</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a crucial hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction of rape.</seg>
<seg id="3">If necessary, hundreds of plaintiffs preparing the next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and a forum for 11 weeks the night where she was allegedly raped by a soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">C "was in October 2008, she returned to its barracks at Miramar air station, north of San Diego, after having had dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It was a wake-up call," said Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texan has set aside its concern.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought, no, it was 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is in Texas," she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I had to keep my intuition."</seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after entering the house of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind, ground and raped her, are they trying to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others not, anxiously wait the court ruling in a landmark trial to be conducted in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape in the army, undercutting the soldiers' constitutional rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the trial involved initially 17 plaignants. that number increased to 28 the following month, 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow troops they also claimed that the army had not investigated, prosecuted or to provide justice adjusted after the alleged attacks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Susan Burke said attacking military galonnées, because the problem starts with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The army is a vertical structure" cashflow.</seg>
<seg id="18">"who are the people in a position to eradicate this culture of retaliation... the leaders'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The lawyer also said that since February, it had been approached by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom would be part of future legal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="20">His strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs in this case, thus putting all its eggs in one basket, she pursue several trial, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, cover the strategy of the defense, and above all, the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in injury or not for service in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a decision of 1950 to the Supreme Court, called the Feres doctrine, the Federal Government is not liable for injuries sustained by the staff in active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the alleged ill is inherent in the military service of plaintiffs" the documents show.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Defense Department has refused to make any comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">While officially, women still do not have the right to go into battle, this distinction exists on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.</seg>
<seg id="28">In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, including to come into contact with the local women.</seg>
<seg id="29">Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives, two thirds in a combat situation.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time for the army to modernise said Susan Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She is not alone in that fight: three other trials are under way in most of theirs.</seg>
<seg id="32">A school of law at Yale, the centre of legal services of veterans is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, by focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims to give them leave - a relatively normally, according to the activists such as Anu bhagwaru branch Women's Action Network (military) Women's Action Network, a group for human rights.</seg>
<seg id="34">The group filed a lawsuit in December at the veterans administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of claims for benefits for the people who say they were victims of a sexual assault in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine independent of each other bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, providing various solutions.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults have been recorded, according to the Centre for intervention and prevention of sexual assaults, sexual assault prevention and response agency) of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is sous-estimé. indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this represents approximately 13.5 per cent of 19,000 incidents this year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the army have been brought to trial, with half the percentage of the civil justice system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke described their aggression as the first in a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the case of Lyman, she informed the rape's military police less than an hour after the incident.</seg>
<seg id="41">That night, she said, he was asked to tell 11 times in detail their rape at various police officers, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">It suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker, due to a cut in his arms, was found in his bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a magistrate in a trial in which she was asked about his sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of its aggression.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people have testified as character witnesses for the offender, who was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day when the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought that I would start to be contractions. I started screaming after the court."</seg>
<seg id="47">"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander" that was not his trial but mine "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Elizabeth Lyman was forced to a psychiatrist military, which came to diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January, she was back on terms less than honorable, preventing him from receiving any advantage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Is that the case Lyman and other plaintiffs will or not, it has been a long history, said John Turley, a law professor at the Law School of the University of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, he said, "in my opinion, they should be able to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="52">Only the doctrine of criticism since its introduction is between them and a verdict.</seg>
<seg id="53">I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is decades behind because they do not have the same benefits and posed by means of deterring the responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="56">These things change only when good have the will to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the trial is not on their side, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, collect its hundreds of other plaintiffs in other trials.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Where until it was still commonplace, one or the other of the two options.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: researchers you study on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy as his anti-immigration views online.</seg>
<seg id="3">Monday, Breivik, who has acknowledged having been taken by a murderous madness in Norway in July left 77 victims, faced his first trial.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being ready to Cyberspace: he had spent a lot of time prior to the attack on his computer, to talk to some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups on the web sites.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how can they find?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy... connectez-vous Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We realized that it was not all that difficult to find them," said Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a report published recently by the reflection group of demos on populism divide in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Facebook full of so many personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the web to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way the mercaticiens have been doing it for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that a million people are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe it has targeted them with advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the announcement encouraged users to respond to an inquiry, and the questions focused on their education, their attitudes to the violence, and their optimism about their own futures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When they come in contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have given 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the Office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is a new way to do research," said Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some results are not surprising, all the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather than men, young and against immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But surprisingly, "those who associate activism online and off line are more sensible, more democratic and less severe than those who stay behind their computer screen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The study of demos is just an example of how Facebook became the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The focus groups, medical researchers and analysts use the web to address all the issues affecting the health issues, such as the social trends, with "I love," publications on the walls and updates of statutes.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users, which adds an average three content per day, the data "supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research the site's name appears in the title of almost 800 percent over the past five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">To some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study of people you could not approach in the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"before, when you try to conduct background checks on people of the British National Party, it was" very difficult to identify them.</seg>
<seg id="20">"you go to the party, but they never would have allowed to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the Web could be a way of identifying and addressing the social and health problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a recent study by the D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook exploits of drunk were much more likely to be discreet beverages that students.</seg>
<seg id="24">Megan Moreno suggests that members of students, such as the advisers, could monitor the site and possibly intervene to help a student whose status speaks too often with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You are not dealing with a problem if you do not diagnosed," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno, Director of the Center for Health, and development of children in the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, said the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We know how to identify the children at risk, and that would be in another case not recognized."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also constant access to information of its users.</seg>
<seg id="28">The team's website, which handles data has studied the statistics on the situation of love and St Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the mid-term elections by 2010 and a National Happiness index (thanks to information available only in digital - champions of freedom have long argued that the web can make available its trove of data to other people for research purposes).</seg>
<seg id="29">But users of Facebook know that the web was watching, they like it or not, in exchange for power to play scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away, the web is allowed access to your information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what happens when the users of Facebook are part of an investigation they have not even heard about?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information by means other than the Internet, it is anything online.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought to the fact that a researcher can consider their profile," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Laboratory of knowledge of London, according to a study by 2006 with the walls Facebook's performance as its students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"as far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">And then the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to determine the extent of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.</seg>
<seg id="37">"what you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">"nothing can replace the real world and to the people," he States.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the social studies are expected to address the social aspect, and the social, not at a computer."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, was described as a "fighter of the resistance" in his first appearance at the trial taking place in Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Frankish of Norway," well before a courtroom packed with 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">"with regard to the jurisdiction of the Court, I repudiate it, because you want your mandate to organizations supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multilateralism."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I know the facts but I do not plead guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The judge torkjel nesheim has suspended Breivik during this monologue because it "did not want to allow him the opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason, it refused to allow Breivik, who has brought with it a words on paper, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge nesheim has also asked the police to keep Breivik in 12 weeks longer detention, he was prohibited from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities were very nearly all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some had come in the hope of Breivik look in their eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="11">All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I thought it was cold and inhumane," said one survivor of utoya to the Norwegian television network NRK.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" I was not comfortable with it, but I have some personal advanced after having seen and heard the suspect ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial he has looked into the eyes of the journalists and the survivors in entering and leaving the Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the odd notion that Breivik belongs to a movement of "resistance," the judge has determined that it was mad not and he also said that there is no evidence that it has acted with accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, perhaps in warm some.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I would have preferred that it seems to be a monster, but that is not the case," said a relative of a victim.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would have been much easier."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 from the interview lost to Steve Jobs, to film this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 last October, some have compared to Henry Ford, marked by the technical genius and inventor of the modern computer.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what apple fans may find more revealing in a maintenance of Steve Jobs found recently that will be published this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative spirit had come to understand the process and workflow products.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was no doubt a creator and a rêveur. he identified with a hippie but was also very careful and held as a améliorateur of charts, a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease their suggesting that a clever idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual labor between a brilliant idea" a product of emergency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob cringely developed the television series "triumph of the nerds" this series traces the birth of the computer, and it sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time, for about 10 years, Steve Jobs had to leave apple. he was already working hard on its new computer company next to a people's adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of the interview with cringely is used in nerds, he said that the main copies have disappeared in the carriage.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that full video is found in the garage of the filmmaker.</seg>
<seg id="9">This video, rising slightly, is the basis for 68 minutes film Steve Jobs: the lost interview, which will be distributed to film next Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone known for hating the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose biography of technological and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly carefully.</seg>
<seg id="12">On four different points during the interview, the answers are a long time after the issues - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, in which Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.</seg>
<seg id="13">We also discover moments when the been too perfectionist of Steve Jobs, reappearing where it seems anxious to hear the issues of cringely, kicked him to elbow for the move and moving on to larger issues or topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before the era of pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something oddly prescient on lost interview. Steve Jobs assesses what is good or bad for the other companies and its vision on the future of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and based on human rights that we see here, the dreamer anxious on the eve of greatness.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things can be and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">They said later they put up implementing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Here's a quick summary of seven remarkable clips of lost interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">How he has learned to conduct business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"during all these years, I have always asked: 'Why are you doing it?' and the answers are always the same: 'Oh, simply because" we need to make them.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody knows why, nobody is thinking in depth with things in a company.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is what I found.</seg>
<seg id="23">Steve Jobs with details of continues its efforts to simplify accounting for apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Perplexed at how the costs were registered, it often begins with a "standard" estimated to cost to nose, then adjusted with a "variation," he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of business costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On the opportunity to play a round with the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="26">Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" that he has created with Steve Wozniak, a device used to hack into the telephone networks and telephone with free longue-distance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The device has been the subject of numerous written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the blue box as an act of ownership is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">He described how he and Wozniak had tested the box using a public telephone, through an appeal later by connecting to a network at & T to another while bypassing satellites as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We enveloppions of the different things a half-dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and you scored a minute later to the public telephone next door," explains jobs laughingly.</seg>
<seg id="30">"we were young and through this blue box, we have learned that we can create something capable of controlling billions of dollars in infrastructure in the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">We did not know anything about both, but we knew invent something capable of controlling of great deeds this incredible was a lesson, and I do not believe that apple would one day have existed without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Steve Jobs continues in recounting a wonderful round that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the blue box in the middle of the night by trying to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="33">While several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned to the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are crazy laugh just before the Pope himself was awakened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On his love with technology (and canvassing for bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years, hunting for spare parts to manufacture a fréquencemètre, it seeks the number of bill Hewlett in the Yearbook and a coat of it over.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after their conversation in 20 minutes, Steve Jobs get a summer job in part-time Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This has had a significant influence on I. It" was the only company that I had seen at that age and this formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated ."</seg>
<seg id="38">Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, based in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first laptop computer ever conceived.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as big as a suitcase, owned a small tube cathodique. I have fallen in love.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adolescent that I was "HP returned home and began to write programs for the machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On the improvisation of innovation.</seg>
<seg id="42">At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs spoke of inventing new products on a whim.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the beginning of his career, when he moves to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working at only 30 days of credit, it was to take care of the Assembly as well as the delivery of aircraft finished.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember big disputes... they shouted above me in claiming that it would take five years [to manufacture a mouse that cost $300). I have had enough, I left and went to see" a developer.</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could manufacture for $15 and which was incredibly reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On the large companies that have lost momentum.</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before it does revive apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders are wrong and losing control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">"suppose you work for IBM and Xerox, you made a clearer copier and printer, and after?</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is not more than successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">The sales and marketing can change, so [those types of people] that eventually run the companies and professionals in product are placed at the gap of decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="53">The engineering in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine a good product from a bad product - the manual work required.</seg>
<seg id="54">That is what happened in Xerox's...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox could hold the whole computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It could have been 10 times its size, Xerox is alleged to be the Microsoft of the 1990s...</seg>
<seg id="57">They snatched the defeat to the victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On innovation as a form of art.</seg>
<seg id="59">"an awful lot of manual work between a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea," it is changing and growing.</seg>
<seg id="60">You learn much about its intricacies.</seg>
<seg id="61">There is room for compromise... some things you can do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, factories as well.</seg>
<seg id="62">You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) assembling them.</seg>
<seg id="63">Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste it is to try to give you the best products were created by men, and to try to make these things in the product that you create.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health law while the Court meets</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the question of political discord, whether the President's opposition to the law Obama of health will be heard, two of the justices, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who defend the case before the High Court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.</seg>
<seg id="4">One case involved a lawsuit by 26 States challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for activists Conservatives nationwide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The justices agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument of 5.30 is due in March next year, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 race, which will be in full swing at the time the Court's decision will be made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will be held before the Tribunal and will argue on the rejection of the law, would likely Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen firms have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society (federalist society), a group of dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones day, represents one of the trade associations who have challenged the law, the National Federation of independent businesses, National Federation of independent business).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another developer was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the Court's Conference on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, top Republican declared the Senate and opponent of the law of health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The flagship invited for dinner? scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is not new: the two judges were present to events of the federalist society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct to govern the actions of federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the Code of Canon 4c, which states: "A judge can attend fund-raising organizations linked to law and other while the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honour, or on the programme of such an event."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the mere presence of scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two law firms of the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of the Government Ethics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This violation of ethics and blissful indifference to the Code contradicted the statements of several judges that the Court adhere to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of common cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges drank and were and to a gala fund-raising with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds for this event to dismantle any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas had shown little respect for the criticism that they mix too easily into the affairs of the Court with the agenda of groups such as the federalist society.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist from haut-profil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In addition, the conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, and not scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was Solicitor General of Obama's administration when the initial objections to the law were raised at the court of first instance.</seg>
<seg id="25">His critics have pressed for Kagan recused himself from the case, saying it was too invested in the defense of the law, to be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan has not given any indication that it would.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">There is nothing extraordinary in a company receives an order looking 50 of its products.</seg>
<seg id="5">In contrast, it is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and that 50 had achieved the record sum of $18 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Equally incredible is that Boeing received this order: the Middle East, growing a gold mine of future orders for aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a forecast issued Monday, the Chicago company believes that airlines in the Middle East will need over the next 20 years of 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Over the weekend, Boeing was informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft control of its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this gargantuan control.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boeing has announced at the Berlin Air Show in Dubai from 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.</seg>

<seg id="14">"These customers in particular have great value."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the Middle East, the oil producing countries have much more of their airlines.</seg>
<seg id="16">They not only have the means to pay for the planes, but a rise in fuel prices, usually detrimental for the airlines because it represents their costs the most - would not be so damaging, because the country needs money with the oil price increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the price of oil rises, reported dihora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"They have a built-in risk coverage," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The control of Emirates strengthen Boeing's dominance in the market for wide-body aircraft and help to curb the attempt to curtail the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.</seg>

<seg id="6">"They have threatened our candidates, electoral officials... they took the box, have set up roadblocks... and had forced people to vote" for the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The PRI has ruled Mexico for 70 years until losing the Presidency in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it holds his return, and a victory in the message is an important step in this effort.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat NAG, the Director General of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growing regions of the world should "do everything in their power" to expedite the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.</seg>

<p>

<seg id="9">In recent months, the euro zone has been seriously weakened by a sovereign debt crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously soared, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11">The flourishing of sovereign debt crisis in Europe has been splashing the fear that the global economy is not in recession, and the appeal of the leading emerging economies to come together to help the euro zone to find a solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Pentagon's stern warnings about potential cuts of the defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on the Congress Monday, warning that the impending automatic cuts would undermine national security that triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan through the gatherings of civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon digests already $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but fear now that an additional $600 or more cuts have to be imminent if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the Ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, r-arizona, and Lindsey Graham, r-south Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called the kidnapping, would 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"such a significant reduction, applied and indiscriminate, make the most of our vessels and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building, and severely affect other efforts to modernize," written Panetta to senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We would also be forced to separate us in a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed if quickly, almost certainly we should send civilians on leave without pay" in order to achieve the goal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes ébranleraient the faith of those who support our military and endommageraient seriously our preparation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts would affect any combat troops, continued Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Although funding in time of war of accounts of contingency operations abroad was not directly affected by the abduction, the war effort would be negatively affected by the severe disruption in the core," warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The contractor personnel would be reduced, delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract that support the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the personnel manager salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays of payments to suppliers of war, and the support is legal and political disruption."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"the result of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of us as the undisputed global head of military power."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are firmly opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is not a result that we can live with, and that is certainly not what we should impose."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">That the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or appeal to exempt the Pentagon cutbacks, remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly virulent regarding possible cuts, even if he's in the top post of the Pentagon holding several years of expertise of the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense has painted a bleak picture of what may happen - a military with a shell, but not the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a marine vessel without."</seg>
<seg id="22">"This is a team without bullets."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is a fighter plane, without enough pilots trained."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs which do not have enough trained soldiers could do the Mission," said Panetta in his introductory remarks at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a strength depressed, unprepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries."</seg>
<seg id="26">"de facto," it is an aggression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta stated specifically how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects might move on to sunset, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">The list included the fighter f35 joint strike, a new bomber planned ballistic missile submarine, the new generation of combat, the new ship coastline and the new field, to replace the Humvee vehicle of the army and navy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Put an end to the development and testing of the f35 could generate cost savings of $80 billion over 10 years, but his supporters say that is a vital step to improving and for potential threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="8">The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign financing in the coverage of an extramarital affair.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then, none of that has experienced history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying in its second term on ever more his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>

<seg id="11">There have been cases where teachers have given the answers of tests for students in order to curry favor with on their performance evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="12">The mentors who should teach the contrary to send messages that lying and cheating are acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How many deception let us meet?</seg>
<seg id="14">On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, many of these are lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that foreigners are deceiving three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Detection or monitor falsehoods is a core competency that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to get who said: "I have had," the detection of fraud is a serious arm of scientific knowledge based on data collected over the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted a thorough search of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies were démystifiés.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Liars you look in their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do bégayent, or are not always feeling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Not to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lie detector qualified can discover the truth by examining the structure of the Declaration, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the issue and the response time.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years studying scientific results in the large corps and always emerge from the knowledge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of modern deception is a skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world, especially if your responsibilities include the hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liars are adept at both read the other, at home, in managing their own emotions and intuitively that detect how others perceive the.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know from research that the extravertis lie more than the many cases inward looking and do, the men say more lies "focused on them," while the women say more of lies "centred on the other" - usually to protect one's feelings - for a married couple lying less often to their partners that unmarried people (but that the lies that they tell tend to be huge).</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a mécréant, the others will feel less guilty to lying.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How can you tell if someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, look at the normal condition of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is called "Establishing the baseline data."</seg>
<seg id="31">This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring further changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Look at the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.</seg>
<seg id="33">You must know if someone rubs its normal feet constantly so as not to launch perfidious when you see wagging the feet in the middle of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then look for the signs of conduct misleading statements and non-verbal.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these indices such as red flags, not evidence of deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The misleading people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can target their feet toward the door, look to a door, significantly change of position or make a relief "post-interview exaggerated" - a sigh of relief, a change of position when all the difficult questions are.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interrogators are often falsely that the interview was completed just for trying to start the reaction post-interview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also, heed the vocabulary of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">The famous Scott Peterson has gone through the past while claiming that his wife killed was alive, triggering a national search for the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The misleading people can also use language became: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat entirely a difficult issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most frequent verbal indicators is subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Someone can use much of "waffle" during its response to a difficult issue: "well... to tell the truth... if I remember property... to my knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="43">This makes the perceptive response rather than factual and is often a red flag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Those skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by Hustlers in their personal and professional lives.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Gazette of TransCanada, Alex pourbax, contends that the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval from a pipeline, but with a different route.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">Monti has said that he would announce the result of his conversations with the President's political parties in his essay to form a Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti has not said explicitly that it could form a Government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"The framework is now well established," ajouta-t-il.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process to form a Government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to levels of impossible to sustain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy who had been assigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In emphasizing the pressure on Monti to dispatch, the volatility of markets to placed the yield on the 10-year Italian bonds construction above the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu saved.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">Emma marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' association Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We have said that we would support the Government."</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to sort of this emergency.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be unpopular austerity reforms.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by noting that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">Monti has said that his Government would persist until the future elections, scheduled in 2013, despite the widespread predictions on the fact that the politicians give it only time to implement the reforms before making the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections before a process required by the financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Its proponents Costa Ricans, the fact that Pearl jam will come to Costa Rica is a dream come true, do you realize that your fans live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Moving to Costa Rica is a dream that came true for us.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the second time in the South and Central America and so far this has been stellar.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a beautiful country, and I think we can spend a few days.</seg>
<seg id="13">This émotionne us to bring our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.</seg>
<seg id="15">What is your message to your most ardent followers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you to stay around us for all these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been 21 years before we arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry that so many time had to spend up to this concert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people are already saying that the concert is the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">What this adds a bit of pressure in your visit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the shows more we have offered during the last 21 years have occurred within the last two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We offered a huge two shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has been edited for the concert to Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are very keen to occur.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we like to make the SURF and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How have you discovered Costa Rica and its waves to make the SURF?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in tamarindo, and the waves are incredible there.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends still to make the SURF in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in addition to Mexico, are great places to make the SURF; that is what we have learned, through the gents who love the SURF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">When the tour, you AVEs offered enormous shows, with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What do you have planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As we have never products there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we try to interpret songs of each album and give our fans a good and various directory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never tell the Repertory.</seg>
<seg id="32">What is this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone likes of different songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose what songs interpret each evening.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the Repertory that we no longer have interpreted for very long, it helps us to stay focused and surprising because we recall the reasons why we love these songs and that we can have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">As a result, the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it also becomes more attractive to people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this trip, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="37">In retrospect, it is difficult to believe everything that you have?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the first place, I do not believe that any of us have ever imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years is that it looks like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together we émotionne much.</seg>
<seg id="41">We love and we love create music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are fortunate to go to parts of the world where we have always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could only get better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">That meant for you to have been a key factor in the creation of the grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It was always an honour for us to form part of the group of major groups.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are very friendly with the people of soundgarden, mudhoney and Alice in chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when a movement arose from a group of friends and is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, a group arises from the city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups at the same time from the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the Group in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">We still play with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year we had a festival with Alice in chains and we have been in Canada with mudhoney, we saw at soundgarden in their tour, therefore we are lucky to be still friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of the sound of Seattle, which has arise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is very strange that a group like the your remains united and with the same members for so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and MATT (Cameron) here 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally lasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the first place, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we all care for others.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all intimate friends and with that of musical boulevards that give freedom to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have to trust each other with the music of everyone and it can only get better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, with your success, you could do what you want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How do you find a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We make sure that we do not take too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and loving people of your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">If we do not forget that people are out there for the music, it helped us not to forget that we must respect the music has and made, without falling into the head is famous and a rock star, which is not really to any of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How you remember your project, Mother Love bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I believe we have written a good songs and at the beginning it was magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have been a group for nearly three years and we have not published a disc before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it took so little, and the most important is that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) which began in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo of the incredible person that Andy has been and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laughing, talking about the music, the football and many other things with him.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is a surprising and we lack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The national group las robertas will open the show to Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie vedder and for this you have chosen for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production has sent us videos with different proposals and this was the group that we liked him more, therefore we are eager to see what las robertas can offer online and it must be very fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why change you always yello Ledbetter's words in direct?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">It is a matter for ed (Eddie vedder), so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">It is the singing and I believe that it did with the first words that he imagines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">As bassiste, what are its influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">There's so much...</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the first which I remember there are geezer Butler, John entwistle, C.J. ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, chuck dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many influences, that I could talk about the entire afternoon on the bassistes that I love.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has succeeded Pearl jam has maintained under the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think of it, this reminds me of the groups that I mentioned, as mudhoney, soundgarden, nirvana and all those who have surfaced at the same time and, if this is now under, I think this is wonderful, because it is a worthy music listening and the groups as mudhoney are now the best music than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the beginning, the music had a more obscure and now it has become more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">What is this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is interesting, because I think there has been some songs on the new album, which seem more light, but there were also songs, such as the end or just breathe qualified as songs very obscure, even if they may sound a little positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With the two, when ed has played for me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply obscure songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think that if you empowered and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, is that for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">I also think that it can also be pleased and even as it can be made of the obscure music.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Super Mario has fought, indefatigable, for 25 years to save at the Princess peach from the clutches of villain bowser, but it had never been done in three dimensions: in "super Mario 3D land" he will fight for the sake of the young technology stéréoscopique.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The title, which expires this month to stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to harness the characteristics of the Nintendo console mobile 3Ds, which allows the use of play in three dimensions without glasses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"Mario is the man who must say it must operate the stéréoscopie without glasses," said the Head of Press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Alvarez said that "super Mario 3D land" is "the first video game for Nintendo originally designed for this support," because of the success so far as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: ocarine of time 3D" was the adaptation of existing securities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, in spite of being in 3D, "super Mario 3D land" is a video game "accessible" that allows a Party quickly and smoothly.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once overcome, most experts may make a "second round" levels of play, which this time are more difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, users can choose to real time between an aggressive "d" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but that would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The incursion of super Mario in the three-dimensional also requires the return of the personality of a console mobile, a fact that was happening in 2005.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The architects coincide on the appropriateness of the convening beyond the controversy over the fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The municipal assistance for the 16 doors again opened the debate on the role of collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the middle of the 1980s, in the culmination of the déjà-éteinte Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration has printed posters of promotion of collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure defines the mountain as the great metropolitan park in the Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park in New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in many people's imagination, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that focuses not on the North-South axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (Sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The qualification of collserola as Park is for the benefit of this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was more Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boar in the role of the Yogi bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the situation until, in September, the mayor called a méga-compétition composed by 16 competition for all access doors to collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door leading to the idea of Park, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is, or someone wants to stem the tide.</seg>
<seg id="13">The issue appears alone: collserola: Park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The assistance, both for his organization as regarding the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all architects of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a recurring theme that two members of the ancient caste of elected speak when they identify themselves in an elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this is one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel any, Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: the examination is appropriate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For any, after addressing the littoral front "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain front" because the speech of ildefons Cerda, blocks Green has not been brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have to start from the premise that the largest fleet of Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things for its availability.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex ," gave the verdict the architect for the title of" collserola "contains a" Trap doors "lexicon: No need to consider them" such as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas in which we must act ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, as any and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils."</seg>
<seg id="23">The perils that is caused by "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after his experience in the 1980s and who was in the area of the Forum "his" swan song.</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build.</seg>
<seg id="25">"limit something already means making the next step," i.e., crossing it.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have to think of new instruments urban-planning, planning, because current [in reference to outline metropolitan (PGM) ] can cause of authentic disasters."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">By keeping more to the issue, modol binary form that, briefly, the slope of the region El valleys of collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol said that there was already a work by the sponsorship of collserola which "should not be lost," in appreciation for the opportunity that the mayor gave his corporation to be involved in this project, "from the first moment."</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition, it means that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this profile technical must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he says) which is a creation of: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona insinuated that the answer to the question that provides the title of the piece is complex, with bases of support it lacks a comprehensive vision of collserola: 'they called 16 competitive business, he says, to bring montagne-mer, but there was not a longitudinal reading that way and understands the entire area ."</seg>
<seg id="31">This is, at least in this case, that he has chosen to take part in the 16 contests.</seg>
<seg id="32">In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the programme and with that definition of the architect of the door nearby.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the Gaza immediately from ronda of dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the City and the Green.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, Secretary of communications and transport, said that before the take-off of the airplane, the pilot noticed that the climate conditions are adequate to steal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The elements seem to indicate that the Unit has had a number of contacts with the soil, the blades had contact with trees to 25 metres when unity has lost the fuselage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It also informed that the Unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it fulfilled the requirements necessary to transport personnel.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, he said that the investigations conducted in the impact zone does not apply the emergence of parts to the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"in a research there reported that there is a lack of parts and components of the aircraft in another location, the impact has been presented in a structural.</seg>

<seg id="9">The ground was a Pante of seven to 30 degrees of willingness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For the moment, the Secretary said that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible, but the investigation could last a few months, it may even take a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Managing Director of airports and auxiliary services has assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the major State presidential functioned in speed of cruisers and this happened on a soft soil ascendant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This information supports the hypothesis of a cruiser operating at the time of the impact," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Perez Jácome, outlined six important elements in the investigation:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Visual flight.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the regulations, the flight was conducted under the visual flight rules, which means that the crew should have the visibility during the flight and ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Weather:</seg>
<seg id="17">The reports in IMMA gave adequate conditions during takeoff, and, as a measure that the aircraft was moving towards the border zone between DF and the State of Mexico had layers of clouds to low height.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Selected roads.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="22">Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in one small area.</seg>
<seg id="23">The information available so far suggests that the impact was held on a straight path and lateral.</seg>
<seg id="24">The model of dispersion of remnants of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter had struck against the concrete floor in terms of structural integrity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It was not detected traces of fire or explosion.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the area there was still no sign in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.</seg>
<seg id="27">The final results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had wide contacts with the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">During the ground work the pieces of the aircraft were found at a height of 9000 200 feet above mean sea level, the ground was a slope which ranges from seven dégrées to 30 degrees of willingness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly désarticulé during his trip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The information provides evidence that suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple impactes with the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">After careful research in an area further that place surrounded, around the accident, it has not found of disperses parts of the aircraft, which bears the presumption of that impact has taken place in conditions of structural integrity.</seg>

<seg id="1">The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the Cassis</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researcher of the Chemistry Faculty of the UNAM, develop asphalt modified with polymer to produce a mixture with a better return, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the signales that the streets were solved, there would be no need to repair some 200 thousand Cassis each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Valle de Mexico, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Chemistry Faculty (FQ) of the UNAM, which ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement is adequate, the Cassis could be reduced or even eliminated altogether.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">During its Conference a technological opinion on the Cassis, organized as part of the International Year of the chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater strength, both high and low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera argued that such asphalt modified organisms could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the efficiency, and therefore, the training of Cassis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt, the greatest share of oil, is a set of molecules of oil, with a heavier molecular weight molecules, called asphaltènes, and of molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together provide the paved its characteristic viscoélastique behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The viscoélastique behaviour of the Asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C viscosity is very great and 50 degrees C he introduced a State almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt is slashing, ajouta-t-il.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Ciudad de Mexico in their majority were covered by a stone flexible, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the more superficial is the layer of asphalt, trained by small stones drenched in asphalt and compactées later.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Each of the small stones which form the layer, signalât-il, is bathed year asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">When vehicles are generating efforts, it provides that forces spread very well in the sack.</seg>
<seg id="13">If negotiations had been changed to the asphalt, spread quickly better, opinât the chemical playing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the layer of asphalt, he says, there is a final layer called the layer of Rolling Stone, made fine sand, which is also immersed in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As it was in contact with the wheels of the car, it needs more mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and friction in the street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">As part of the stone to receive and distribute the efforts, the layer of rotation also demands that it has adequate thickness and the material that she is there must be treated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor, especially water, he says, because they affect considerably the efficiency of the layer of asphalt.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">When the ground is wet, Water spreads to the interior of the layer is difficult as it is, this soggy lump all the layers of stone and therefore cause of Cassis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the trial of formation of a Cassis, he says, the first to be striker is the film course and only later was assigned the layer of asphalt, but the damage was not immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to first signs with adequate maintenance programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member of the national system of researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of Cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of stone must always be linked with the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to prevent the formation of frequent Cassis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera has warned that it was still investigating and work on the asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and help to repair the Cassis easily and without having to use the high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">That failed in Valle's candidate to be the new miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramirez Serna does not produce the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle receives its title number 14 of Princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Of new Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle with the fact of being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of money and the Band that the honours as new Princess of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result yesterday evening in Cartagena, where miss Atlantic is mounted with the Crown and the sceptre, the Department amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one in a legion of women of Valle del Cauca, who found themselves near the Crown but have been proclaimed Princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rosemary ALZATE (1983), Olga Maria arenas (1987), Leila blanque (1988), Monica EVERS (1989), Maria consuela pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle accused aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie accused aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Now the big question is where many people.</seg>
<seg id="8">What's needed... because the result is the defeat of a favorite in each presentation has demonstrated that it was all for the new miss Colombia because it had not been elected in vain Queen of the police and best Jolie of vogue, documents obtained by the Queens taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor considered key to the decision by the jury of her first Princess is the fact that she was not satisfied with his response to the question "What was the book that you a marked and why? posed by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the carreta Literaria leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">This is the candidate of Valle's response to this question:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of taking final culturaliser, I believe that the book that has marked my children is" the Little Prince ," a book that is quite deep.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now I read "crime and punishment" is a book to read literature universal that we should all; and now I read the book of Irene nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "the love of the blood" ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The response has not pleased first of all because of the term is culturaliser "and secondly to do not explain exactly how each book he had marked.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt relaxed and pleased with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for the world, please read a little, "the Little Prince" is a great book "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Between the assumptions launched that Valle was destroyed by cronyism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist from Bogota has hinted that being the preferred, the ovationnée and the candidate who received all preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy oster, the public vote for the best homemade costume, and Queen Mother), "It has roused the envy of other candidates, a stressed-out Queen and that is why it has not conspicuous on the scene."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And it was noted that in his first appearance in swimming trunks at the Hilton and its two marches of the eve of the coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if the two parades had she appeared sure of itself, that it did not have the strength and the energy of representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist from the programme "como en Casa" (as in the House), Canal RCN said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirmed that the candidate who gets the most prices during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen."</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle has avoided the media at the end, and that was a mistake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another possibility is that Valle has failed to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the national beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why, two days before the election the legally binding international Lucy doughty said they sought a woman initiated in regard to the social needs of his country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"only the beauty is not sufficient for a miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in the projects," expliqua-t-elle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">He also speculates that Valle has sinned by its defects in its back and fibrosis which is observed in his abdomen, but that is contradictory, precisely because the jury was elected as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the more healthy body, good food and physical work responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The trainer of Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best corps, that it is best, "but its fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well-known, he left points on the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine cromos considers that the mistake of Valle's candidate was the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The surgery are good, but Valle has failed them.</seg>
<seg id="29">His body has never been his asset and it has lost because of this ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For that price, that the national beauty contest starts for the first time, after the parade in swimming trunks had created a bitter prediction which was completed yesterday evening, it was said that this was a gift that Raymundo was to Melina for not giving him a taste of the Crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">True or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of rule, not as sovereign, except as a Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in international competitions by nomination of a national contest.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will go down in history as one of the Queens that despite its dazzle crossing in Cartagena, failed to win the Crown.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A Cali dactyloscopiste went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of 'Alfonso Cano.</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these officers is crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste ITC of Cali has gone down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of FARC: "Alfonso Cano," considering his fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of 'availability of Eliazar Gonzalez, a man of Puerto Tejada has worked for 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes of Choco, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the corpses that should be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and having read courses, it specializes in Fingerprint Offices, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">During the week of the Operation under the alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take with him clothes for at least three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Something very large waiting there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Friday, the night he went to Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew that he had identified two corpses and that the suspected that one of them was the man who headed the guérrilla's earlier world, therefore he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But when he arrived with the investigative team to the body, it has not recognized by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">He did not have a beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area without glasses and much smaller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But fingerprints don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a préleveur and a lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the card.</seg>
<seg id="16">His eye had deceived him not: there were "Alfonso Cano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the leader of the FARC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In search of the footprint</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For a dactyloscopiste of Cali sijín the recognition that the President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar Gonzalez, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of people to not know our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fingerprint offices is an exact science, no margin for error, which could be crucial in the resolution of crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In part to identify the corpses, dactyloscopistes supports the investigations for the crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of people captured.</seg>
<seg id="23">When caught, many offenders submit false identity cards or have no official.</seg>
<seg id="24">We take their fingerprints and seek it in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The researcher was Conte that cases of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to remove a vault full of jewelry and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult because they have no suitable areas for a fingerprint, but in this case, we have been able to gain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recently there was a man dead, with bottles of drinking around him.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the intermezzo investigation has determined that a parent can be suspect of crime and a footprint on the cylinder coincided.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even if no guarantees that it is not the killer, that puts him on the scene of the crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">An ITC dactyloscopiste clarified that the excerpt from "the fingerprints of objects with reactive chemical or physical."</seg>
<seg id="32">When they appear, using a préleveur or a band for the draw.</seg>
<seg id="33">Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the National Civil Registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented aliens, showed the ITC expert.</seg>
<seg id="35">He explained that not everything is how the shows in the television programme.</seg>
<seg id="36">As all that glitters is not gold, all that would be touching is not necessarily a footprint.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, it can be used, when one realizes the confrontation necessary.</seg>

<seg id="6">Higher than the second quarter for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March, 2012, requires the highest rate of increase for the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of acquisition plan for restoring the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the enterprises have increased their investment by 1.1 per cent, compared with the decline of 0.9 per cent capital observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of increase non-interrompue.</seg>

<seg id="1">The CDU nominated the European President by universal suffrage</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, passed without serious difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also serve as President of the Christian Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="3">The future of Europe was not initially to programme but has imposed in the fall, such as the activists who consider the Government's policy too lax of Greek today and possibly Italian tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4">The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 1001 delegates, only nine against and 10 abstaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The standing ovation for several minutes to which have been law, on the basis of their statements, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Finance Minister, leaves no room for doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The focus of the Chancellor, and the motion - under a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less but more of Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because peace is the Europe but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For the Chancellor, "The time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="10">This could include modifications to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the supervision of the European Union on the fiscal policies of countries of the euro zone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="11">That is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Certainly, it is unlikely that the 27 quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders understand that Nicolas Sarkozy is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the milestone.</seg>
<seg id="14">Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to balance the weight of each country on the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously meant to strengthen Germany's weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To defuse the climate within his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but it has not sought to win his Congress on the back of "small" European countries or countries in trouble quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">If the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of the Franco-German friendship ,"" Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recalling that two centuries, Leipzig was the focus of a bloody battle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">That represents the fraud sick?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the allowances, the UMP and the Government launched the offensive on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the recurrent theme - since 2007 - of the fight against social and welfare fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And in support of the offensive, which stems from a desire to save money in a context of discipline, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign to right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">In first for budget savings: the Government planned to impose the employees of the private a fourth day of deficiency before a work stoppage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In clear, without specific business agreement, an employee who fell ill would lose four days' salary, so at least 15 per cent of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A measure that could lead to anger, but that would rescind 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic: impose staff with a day of deficiency uncompensated for absence from work, they have not so far of waiting, for three days in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although they are under discussion, the majority recovery also the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you rembourserez," warned Xavier Bertrand at micro of RTL, Sunday November 13.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the stunts seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to work stoppages.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, it is the subject of a constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which typically have borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Take us to first on the national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances have been issued in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the Institute of Research and Documentation in health economics, the benefits were in 2008 5% health expenditures, with 11.3 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this sum, 46 per cent maternity leave and workplace accidents, and 54 per cent were sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">And therefore 2.5 per cent of health spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have experienced an average 14.5 days of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Group Alma consulting.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average that obscures the variations: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site monster.com, showed that 75 percent of 40,000 French employees interviewed said they were taking no day of sickness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time of insurance, said that in 2010, 37 percent of sick leave were for less than 8 days, 22 per cent from 8 to 14 days, 15 per cent of 15 days to one month, 15 per cent of one to three months and 11 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When compared with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more inclined than elsewhere to work stoppages.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long study in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall lack (for health reasons or not) in France, hovered between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 percent and 28 percent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 percent and 18 percent in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud sick or very little face to work illegally.</seg>
<seg id="25">As for the fraud, it reaches only a small scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of the law since 2002 fact that systematic controls are on sick leave for more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13 percent of 285,000 made for periods of short were "unjustified or too long," or 37 050 case.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11 per cent of cases "inappropriate or unjustified" of 1.2 million, 132 million.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In total, therefore 169,000 case "unjustified," on several million employees have had a sickness.</seg>
<seg id="30">A figure that is very little about, for example, the black work.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in tax loss per year, more than the total cost of day, and therefore much more than the recent fraud.</seg>

<seg id="1">They legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a Committee of Experts</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and the doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond the cancer cases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian company live in denial about the death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9 percent of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take appropriate measures to that effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts linked in a variety of areas, including ethics, law and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Committee called on the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, after which is imposed, with a patient felt competent to take such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who described the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about the death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medicalization or not, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6 percent of them eventually die in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, the country is in Quebec that the rate is the highest, with 86 percent of the deaths occurring in hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are at odds with the position of the Federal Government, which has already said it will change nothing in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this decriminalization might be abused in the application, including the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on people not competent or not willing.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, said yesterday in teleconferencing Jocelyn downie, author of the report, would reveal many more cases of these excesses in the same country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."</seg>
<seg id="17">"assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadian support for euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Recall that 85 percent of Canadians have already voted in favour of the euthanasia because they think it would allow people in later life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66 percent believe that to legalize euthanasia will not simply to send the message that the lives of the disabled or elderly people is worth less.</seg>
<seg id="21">Those who assisted suicide, respondents to 41 per cent felt they should not be prosecuted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In peacekeeping or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Panel also asked that the health professionals are trained the obligation to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and the doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond the cancer cases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee urged that it be period, when it does not reduce the physical pain, as of euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The reserves of other experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Panel's report of the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Pierre me Deschamps, a specialist in Health Law, called the "extreme" the position of the Signatories to the experts report, among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for terminally ill patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and to be more than 18 years might ask what it means to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted me yesterday a summary of the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">Deschamps me also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the autonomy of the individual above all other values that are part of the social fabric of the society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">However, "in society, it is the beacons and constraints."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The health law officer Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she referred to as "pro-euthanasia" manifesto.</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, which itself is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes in particular the data in the report about the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The Grand Social Democrat / Christian Democrat coalition government in power in Austria decided Tuesday to write into the Constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible slump by rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple-A).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">This is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt amounts to 74.6 percent, well above the 60 percent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt of countries like Italy, Greece and Spain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"If the solvency of Austria was lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion more in interest each year," argued the Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Austria is following a request of the Brussels Summit of member countries of the euro zone's 26 October: Heads of State and Government were claimed by the end of 2012 the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equal value.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon the nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has not been the case in Belgium, which makes the supports the need to find a source of replacement alternative, or of Switzerland, which will just not building any more than the last generation plants.</seg>

<seg id="13">By contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, continue their projects with determination.</seg>
<seg id="14">The US have decided after Fukushima added one at their park with the construction of a central adjourned after the accident at Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, focus on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the reality will upset the speech.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will lead to the rise in the price of electricity, energy dependence is aggravated by the increasing reliance on imported gas, in particular Russia, a jump of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark is to entertain.</seg>
<seg id="19">European champions of the wind, which has 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittent winds; as a result, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the contrary, thanks to the resilience of our energy policy, our neighbours paid a bill of electricity 40 per cent higher than that of French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a globalized economy, the cost of power is a key factor for competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the industrial base on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheaper electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear brought a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory fine words on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, because they lack of opposition in principle to the energy, the polls show.</seg>

<seg id="25">Strong exports, it involves a galaxy of SMEs agencies on the international market and makes them very job-creating non-transferable.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France were to agree to phase out nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by greatly reducing the annual EUR 6 billion of French exports of nuclear facilities and services.</seg>

<seg id="35">A Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="36">A Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two unprecedented natural disasters, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will draw lessons from the accident, as it had for the previous two.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Result of the task and the cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR reflects an approach to making it capable of withstanding such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although it is considered by all electricians wanting to build a nuclear power station, halting its construction to flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to competitors of Areva and EDF, leaving the way open for leadership in the inevitable nuclear development.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles -engorgement of police, judicial and administrative services subject to figure, this policy is compatible with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, the administrative harassment against foreign students who was widely reported, the Minister of the Interior (read release may 23) declaring that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is rarely discussed in economic terms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">There was a broad consensus on this subject between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">A right-wing, the tone has been set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976, "¥900 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where nearly 2 million immigrant workers," and there, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery in the world" in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the level of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the country by hordes of Polish plumbers are split on the left and right.</seg>
<seg id="9">For both sides, the immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and the society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is the degree of generosity that opinion be given towards immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In his programme, Francois Holland is confined to the mundane, indicating that the co-development will solve our migration "problem."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, that is perhaps off going; but it is economically very costly.</seg>
<seg id="13">As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book highlighting the latest knowledge on immigration (orphans: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of immigration into the economic growth, employment and wages in the country who are immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Restrict immigration anaemic growth and employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may have to substitute for domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their salaries.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are much more complementary as substitutes for employees, speaking for the national essential in the sectors in employment shortage.</seg>
<seg id="17">The low-skilled immigrants working in areas that do not attract the national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic in which the training does not offer of jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on salaries</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the same way as a surgeon will be hard put to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between national and migrants that the influx of immigrants have a positive effect on the national employment and wages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1 per cent of migration is set to increase between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent of real wages in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity of the immigrants contributed to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel; Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants are net contributors of social systems, an average of one per cent of the total budget in the European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will contribute net income less expenditure of 150 euros to public budgets on average on the whole of his life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wants, at the beginning of the mandate, find the missing growth areas "teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">The teeth in question, serve to discourage immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Paris is concerned about links between Al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Long suspected, the relationship between the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM *) and the Nigerian cult Boko Haram continued.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers was now "satisfied."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the two organizations operate and intelligence reports showed that there is cooperation," he said without being more specific.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris seems to make a similar analysis.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January had uncovered bridges.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of AQIM *, Antoine de léocour and Vincent Delory should be killed the following day with several of their captors during an operation by French special forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the rubble of the intervention, the French investigation and Niger to regain phone chips belonging to terrorists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Axis terrorist</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The analysis of calls made to several sources based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues particularly interested investigators: one leads to a Niger, who has traveled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and one from a man who was close to AQIM * and of the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This is a step forward, but it is probably more formal wait for evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQIM * and Boko Haram."</seg>
<seg id="14">"but it is possible."</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has been clear for years that the cult is outside of intellectual and financial support and that it is increasingly active," moderates kunle amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In recent months the "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram, or in business practices, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosives in increasingly complex and invoice as that used by AQIM *.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, including Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of visionaries little of interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A rapid success</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 to Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin,," calls for the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the poor region, the Association has a rapid success.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is politicized and demand a strict adherence to the sharia as its militants moving the ungodly fight against the central Government.</seg>
<seg id="23">They target churches, bars, authorities.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram is active, launching attacks against police stations.</seg>
<seg id="25">Abuja's response is, as usual, unsubtle.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Army gave the city, 800 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, arrested living, was killed in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Therefore the sect will radicalize and leave its Northern strongholds.</seg>
<seg id="29">At last Christmas, she claims to have an attack that left 80 dead in Jos, then another in Abuja.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, it was in Abuja that Boko Haram takes the secure Headquarters of the police in a suicide attack, its first.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations International will be its first target.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of a major terrorist in Africa which is operating from Mauritania to Somalia in Nigeria is now all security specialists.</seg>
<seg id="33">While AQIM * has invested to Mali and Niger, the Somalis to al-chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, at a meeting in Nigeria with the President Jonathan Goodluck, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all information."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The North Stream, new ntrée door of Russian gas to Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The North Stream, directly linking Western Europe to Russia from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, was put into operation.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must provide gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to mark the event with flashing.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests including four heads of State and Government attended, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and buffet North end, at the inauguration of the stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the first French Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned all the steering wheel of the valve Commander the entry of Russian gas in the Western European network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas more will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km link from St. Petersburg to land of State.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, to issue a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the equivalent of the entire French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">And there is already talk the opportunity to build a third on the same route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge yard has reminiscent of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project has been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">The North Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly in Germany, avoiding any land crossing through a third country, Poland and Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, the two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream to a "new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin, for Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">That means that the issue is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, through its support to the Russian initiative, has won a greater security of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that was because of a weakening of European energy, as the project has created a rift between West and East Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Federation, in just five years, upholding its vision of a direct alliance between the Federation and the rich Western countries, strong gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"The pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organically," confirmed Fillon when opening the pipeline, demonstrating how the big gas contracts are also to political and economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All this demonstrates the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to lubmin, gas at the finish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of the pipeline is also a technical feat.</seg>
<seg id="22">The steel tube is gainé padding to protect them from the anchors of ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is based on the bottom of the Sea, to 200 m on average.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, and we had to prevent minefields from the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="25">"about 100 had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Miller, company spokesperson North Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It has also meant more measures to protect wildlife.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long snake of heavy metal, as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts along its entire length: valve, or maintenance station.</seg>
<seg id="28">A platform to control was set off in Sweden, but have abandoned the project when the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian State company to be permanently off their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In case of failure, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," said Jens Miller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In case of a leak, the gas in the pipeline is released in the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have foreseen the welds to ascertain the flight every 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The State oversight of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, dragged by a foreign ship, for observation, as well as by a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the form of a cigar, he was introduced to the interior of the tube, off one meter in diameter, and it is being pushed by the gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">On arrival, after three days of travel at 3 meters second, providing accurate information on possible distortions of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline has been designed to work 50 years without any compensation.</seg>
<seg id="36">The flow of gas is simply provided by the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is 200 bars on arrival, and 100 departure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have joined forces to carry out the project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leader is Gazprom, which retains 51 percent of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">Joined in the German E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group Suez GDF (9 per cent each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have established a joint venture, called North Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom then leased to the company, renewable for 20 years, all of the transport capacity of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how much gas really carried," said Jens Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The construction of the pipeline has received 30 per cent by the shareholders and to 70 per cent of bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the project is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are safe to return to their cost, since only Gazprom took the risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine.</seg>
<seg id="50">The valves, high of 4.5 metres, formed the exit door of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gas to, before it was transferred to the German lines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 2012, 6 million.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It smacks of adventures, of hours to write in the light of a candle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Carnet moleskine is easily recognizable, with its coverage rectangular black, his elastic, its white sheets a colour broken, as aged by the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the Carnet moleskine as we know it today was born... in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Italian company modo modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook design but distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maria Sebregondi, then as a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book is a former production technology, the mole skin (skin of mole) as a cotton varnish used to cover the bench seats by example.</seg>
<seg id="9">That book was very popular among the writers and passengers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"moleskine handed the taste of a subject old and forgotten, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, up in the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, now the leader of the mark for much less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The success is.</seg>
<seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010, sales have increased by 26 per cent to $12.7 million pieces passed.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is a far cry from the production of confidential early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Italian moleskine transcends borders and is exported in 70 countries, France to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">Difficult to establish an image of the buyer, because the notebook attracts both the businessmen that the student and professionals.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the image of moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The Italian company, who had 12 employees in its infancy, with almost 100 today and for 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York.</seg>
<seg id="18">It distributes its books in bookstores, of the FNAC to small stores in downtown and was able to impose its identity.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have followed the air time and this new clerical, despite the boom of e-mail," said Maria Sebregondi.</seg>
<seg id="20">This signature with the development of cultural moleskine: recently, the mark has launched a "detour" exhibit where architects and artists put their own book.</seg>
<seg id="21">In August, it has also launched coverage in leopard, at the Locarno film festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Taking advantage of its cultural success and this will, moleskine was able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer accessory... the mark is on a wide range of media.</seg>
<seg id="23">A success that made the envious: in the fall of 2006, much less had been bought by the Investment Fund SG capital Europe today syntegra capital, writing a new chapter in the history of moleskine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the unemployment rate of disabled workers remained so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 19 percent of disabled persons are in search of work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 15th week for the employment of the disabled begins today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a proactive policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is two times higher than the average: 19 percent, compared with 9 percent for the whole of the population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Depressing?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No," said Eric blanchet, Director General of the increase, the Association, which organizes the week for "employment of the disabled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the progress made since 15 years" are considerable.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."</seg>
<seg id="9">"but there is still much to do."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, there remain many obstacles before assuming the job.</seg>
<seg id="11">Instead, they are age: 37 percent are over 50 years old (17 per cent on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a low level of skill: 80 percent did not the pan and on the 2.3 million students, only 10,000 have disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53 per cent for the disabled from 38 per cent on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">Short, complicating criteria singularly return to work, and "form the crux of the problem," according to Christian grapin, Director-General of springboard, an association established in 1992 to help firms to hire disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So much for the brakes goals.</seg>
<seg id="16">Is the unspoken, changing attitudes, certainly, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A survey in April by the Association ims-entreprendre for the city indicated that managers interviewed "a low level of awareness of disability," with a "overrepresentation of wheelchair users, or mentally impaired intellectual."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of 6 percent of disabled workers, set in an Act of 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last known figures, from 2008, showed a ratio of 2.6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We are now around 3 percent," said Pierre White, Director-General of the agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting donations for companies that do not respect the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The evidence: the number of schools "taxed," as the amounts, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"the law, which increased the contributions, has created a great deal of pressure on the companies, said Pierre white."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this also reflects a real awareness, particularly in large groups."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82 percent of companies with 100 to 199 employees.</seg>
