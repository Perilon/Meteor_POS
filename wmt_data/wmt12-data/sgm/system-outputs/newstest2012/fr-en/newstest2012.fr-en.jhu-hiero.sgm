<seg id="11">But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for the Libyans.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted the aid with recognition of dogs infidels.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only excuse is that it is not a américian general who led the NATO bombing But Allah They hailed the greatness in every attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="11">Since the beginning is more 12000 sixth in the third pupils who have registered for this project.</seg>

<seg id="1">The designer has to be a good psychologist, says the professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Presentation in an article on the way to learn for the stylistes, I put a little bit angry because there were many from the start.</seg>
<seg id="3">I do not think about what would happen afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="4">The statements of three professionals of the specialty clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">As we approach the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even when there are over the samedis and Sundays is truly "filled."</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we have with the Director alenka - in there is no boy treated in the way to rob the woman who has no statistics standards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And women of this type is the majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, no particular curve, another overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The designer must know how optiquement ammenuiser arms wide, prolonging a neck or add the necessary Phillips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We have managed to highlight described the man and not to pay all too obvious types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hanches said, and a fine size.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If there is such a difference between the size and the hanches so that the skirts or trousers are not at all, this is the time to do it on.</seg>
<seg id="14">And you will regret not because clothing which is impeccablement is priceless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In a tailored skirt you feel much better in that slides continuously, enroule and does not take the belts and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For those who have a male appearance can afford a clothing style Tucker, with bits of tissue cousus, or even broderies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There is obviously a lot of various examples of appearances and I am glad that I have a whole week to separate all the information received.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I also fear that, because of what I should do at home there too.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each trainee received celebrity, to pay for the day and night.</seg>
<seg id="20">We must take into account the current appearance, the kind of way of personality and his appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I will "pay" Miranda Kerr, that you may know of the Victoria's Secret campaign.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Basically, it gives me pleasure because it is better to pay Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost 100 kilos in recent times - do not take my statement svp, completely seriously - or the young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">We must cease and coudre from magazines or try on the Internet, print and work on graphisme.</seg>
<seg id="24">The moodboard, as we say in the final outcome, expresses our personal style graphics and our relationship with the establishment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Graphics also reflect on the part of styling is also important.</seg>
<seg id="26">The designer can not rob and only the physical but productive creates for example the pages in magazines, on products given the trends for the handbags, coats, etc...</seg>
<seg id="27">Mario kamenik, designer and graphiste, we had it all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But this... until Sunday</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The designer must have an overview</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Three guests from the specialty gave a diversified aspect to the session on Saturday with information about the different types of characters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Honza pokorny, designer, Jakub polanka graphiste mode and Ben renc, photographer of fashion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub has reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know it.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a designer of talent can work with a single clothing in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variation is paramount for this example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Such as this trench-coat which must be brought in Classic with a Jean and a T-shirt as a light coat but also it can pay the naked body, with escarpins and taking the photograph as a habit '.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or just up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.</seg>
<seg id="37">"play with it," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But I was particularly pleased with the Council that "for the work you need to know the rules perfectly."</seg>
<seg id="39">"You can then start to infringe," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally I understand why they are trying to learn these Rules, where, what to do with why, when in the fashion magazines sometimes you see something else.</seg>
<seg id="41">No statement on the marches of fashion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have many more varieties of clothes that are photographiées.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is to say that for fashion story that will take a dozen pages, a dozen models - I must be ready for "retailler" at least a fortnight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">We must reckon with this during a creation of a model.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The fact that the image and style are sometimes half of the succés has been confirmed by Honza pokorny.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just look at Madonna is not a great singer, but his image and marketing have turned it into a global star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, the approach towards the use of services stylistes remains cautious.</seg>
<seg id="49">And sometimes faces regard them as useless - it is that I know something but I parais happening in the second row.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if someone is a styling from us, then we must rely on the fact that it is governing with a high likelihood a completely different size - smaller than it has in fact.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then we have to sail on Google and be sure if the wide avenue are state of the infos famous, if it has maigri or stresses etc...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the core that it is not enough to move in the fashion designer and assemble models.</seg>
<seg id="53">He must communicate with the people it habille and so it is important to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">: guess the people not to pander to retain its opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"When a manager asks you to separate its storage cupboard and meet new things you can not just throw everything and say, my God horror."</seg>
<seg id="56">"You will find few cases that you find pretty and that you conseillerez what them," said Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It has shown us precisely what must contain what is known as the "placovka" or bag of designer.</seg>
<seg id="58">Is that you cling on the size and on course for everything you need.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Also things clearly defined as the scissors, the rouleaux for dépilation or the épingles nourrice, there is also the beginning of nylon - the designer uses for photographier products such as bags, or many hats, special clips with which closes a dress in the back, if it is too large - the pin or other type of agrafe are not utlisables because they could abîmer clothing - or a couture kit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">So that we soyions not only people listening but who tried something in practice they have taught us how ressemeller properly shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">And in the photo in the workshop where the surface is equal, the semelle could abîmer, particularly at lextérieur.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And so we have put and put.</seg>
<seg id="63">We did not have the right to reach the scissors inadvertently not to be injured.</seg>
<seg id="64">We must therefore skills.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario was good when he congratulated me for my creation.</seg>
<seg id="66">My comptence State is not for my copine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a brief summary of what we have learned during the second weekend of course</seg>
<seg id="68">I am increasingly understand that make the styling a profession is not a promenade in a garden of roses, everyone says what he wants.</seg>

<seg id="1">The need to speed the run dispute across America.</seg>
<seg id="2">Review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Originally a race without problem due to a series of errors become stupid people who do not have to make a matinal routine trip to work.</seg>
<seg id="4">It fills up to some extent the ambition to everyone but it is no use if no one wants to do something more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new Part sous-titrée the run produced great expectations before his exit.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised to take a new direction, with the series race need for 'speed already old and out a kind of' game from the parties jouables does not consist only with points.</seg>
<seg id="7">So we were curious how the parts will be added, in which the main hero out of his car and does what it wants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As this is already in the series NFS, the result is completely different from the one atttendait.</seg>
<seg id="9">This potentially games of arcades but the whole race draws down due to some unnecessary errors that already exist for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are not really mistakes but rather an expression of idleness incomprehensible from developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has caractériels problems and addressing them is to participate in illegal racing across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">You asseyez behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco, and your job is to be the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea has some interesting points.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.</seg>
<seg id="16">Which means that each race is on a different route and the steps planned in different environments that stand quite far from each other and are worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="17">The player did not believe for one moment that the game offered something similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some environments are also quite beautiful even if the graphics technical level is the same type as the previous series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Finally, this is not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="20">But driving through the desert in the autumn landscapes or in highly covered in snow is very nice visuellement mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The tests are more from time to time agrémentées atypical of a élement.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example in the desert you end up in a sand storm you substantially reduced visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then in the mountains, you must pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Alongside these different races are put together properly behind each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are only a small number but it is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are moments you seek to surpass the required number of opponents - as in a classic - then you chase race against the clock - classic duel with the clock - and then still awaits you another duel with an adversary.</seg>
<seg id="27">From time to time you also the police coming into the game and tries to make the situation dificile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The novelty is places outside the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is rather una interactive animation when most of the time Jack enfuit before someone goes through life and you must help by banging on the right button at the right time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">What is surprising is that there are fewer moments like this that you expect - to be concrete there are only three.</seg>
<seg id="32">The result is that because this is not likely to hinder and is, in the context described above, in what agrémentent the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The code of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but we can not say that it is negative.</seg>
<seg id="35">For the simulation realistic you will see elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But that we could find better in the conccurrence model of conduct goes very well with the kind of design of racing.</seg>
<seg id="37">So everything is OK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The problems start to appear after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Has the diffférence the code of conduct, the collisions is still not right.</seg>
<seg id="40">We do not expect this game a complicated distortion and collisions, but when you have not, during a collision with any subject, the slightest idea of How does your car, so this is not completely right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">During the up close, you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car in the voltiges crazy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or is in tatters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Through the recovery system that is not really a problem, but you really agace.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recovery is so that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the stage the game you back during the last point along the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">But you do not only have 5 redémarrages.</seg>
<seg id="46">When you used the 5 redémarrages you must start the game from the start.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is more a tool, if something is not done properly, seen on which you can really count AN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes the redémarrages do not help the memory and we must find a solution remémorrant piece of route.</seg>
<seg id="49">The major fault of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">For example, there are certain however that it must move in a way or it is not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Otherwise you meet on a given place of vehicles "civilian" still in the same situation that you have come first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late.</seg>
<seg id="52">What will anger the situations when you see move easily between two oncoming cars opponent and when you arrive, you, you need to be set aside and the conturner or curb.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is equal, if you go out to him because it is "calculated" in such a way that the situation there always comes very close to your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Opponents have other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="55">During the time of the game, you again, you arrive in some places, regardless of the time, and you always have the same opponent before you in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">This getting nervous as at the end of game When you going on a long bridge in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The enemy must at all costs through you.</seg>
<seg id="58">When he does to you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you go on a collision course a number of times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you ennuyez quickly.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is a shame, because through a simple code of conduct the game is interesting and the places with such action that you do not have the time to follow everything that is happening.</seg>
<seg id="61">And this is equal, if it is because of the unique concept of 50 routes, that the order of racing is such that there is no chance of being boring or something else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The original idea is the change of car during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars, however, most of the time that you enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sports cars are ideal for American cities, gas-guzzlers for motorways and the super sports cars to exotic clothes right on the lacet conducted very technical, for example on the roads in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">And the way of challenges, which are specific races in places that you know of the journey goes very well with the regime's main history.</seg>
<seg id="67">You get not only the medals but also experience points to add to your profile is common challenges and adventure.</seg>
<seg id="68">When you have reached the highest level of driver, various objects are starting to unlock:</seg>
<seg id="69">It connects online with the Office autolog which among other compare your results with those of other players and you provide other functions in the Community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the hardest blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the game.</seg>
<seg id="71">You arrive with your car in the underground tunnel - it seems - where you going in the dark on the tracks, it seems.</seg>
<seg id="72">Your speed indicator you said between 150 and 200 km / h in principle and behind you is a subway Rame sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.</seg>
<seg id="73">Has the production we had a discussion for a few days to know if anyone has really thought in the creation of this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side of the game is not a bonus, but the visual part is generally good and in some cases really super.</seg>
<seg id="75">Which hampers is that in more extreme situations, the image is not the level and in some cases in a tragic way.</seg>
<seg id="76">This is especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid can serve no imaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The noise is good and the runway is the choice.</seg>
<seg id="78">In order to please the most people and particularly the most noise the young audience a new runway has been created in the style of "I mix everything," but it is expected that no one will buy the stake for music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">General impression of need for 'speed: the run' really is confused.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game had not these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But this game seemed not to be finished.</seg>
<seg id="82">The amusement is really well but prepare you for the mistakes has dwelt in the eye with the force of a réflecteur aérodrome.</seg>

<seg id="1">History of a brand:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If anyone were to seek term which is close to the closest IBM, would be "long term strategy."</seg>
<seg id="4">For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, however, is a firm considered very present and since its inception has passed 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this long term strategy has been thrown by the head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.</seg>
<seg id="6">He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Its slogan "Believe!" has become the footprint around which to develop the life of a future - and also the title of the giant IBM began to éditer in 1935 internal magazine.</seg>
<seg id="8">That was the basis of the culture of the company soignement drafted by Watson.</seg>
<seg id="9">Continuous for us IBM means thinking long term movements directed towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived a hundred years because she always remained true to its core values and however has not been afraid to change all the others around it.</seg>
<seg id="11">This has allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second century, we get even more "has délaré for the anniversary of the current Director of The Samuel J. Palmisano company.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A system well prepared</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of its employees as Bata in Czech Republic - people of IBM employees were the only among the first Americans to have the holidays paid insurance paid by the employer plus a uniform of employee elegant and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and the commmerciaux.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the same way IBM has a relationship with the customer sytème well developed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Society was initially inspired in the discovery of talents- as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have a choice.</seg>
<seg id="17">An anti-discrimination current plan is completely in the spirit of the strategy because it will be a femme- Virginia rometty - who should replace Palmisano the head of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="18">It works for IBM for thirty years and currently holds the post of head of sales, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, the brain- storming online from what is from a future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly half a million people who work there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Internal and external is the image of the company to provide a secure position in the fields of business.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology company," said rosabeth moss kanter, economics professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps to solve the problems of the world of business, using its technology," added Italian geogre colony of the firm consulting Forrester research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and create this market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or the "Big Blue," as it is known as the United States because of its slogan- 100 years it has grown to become one of the world's largest companies.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is obviously the most versatile - it develops software technology company, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, advisory services in the server products to nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">It has many patents on all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among its findings stands for example the distributor notes, the financial payment card, the swap, the bar code or the disquette.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM has been this year with $220 billion the second largest technology company in the market capitalisation, the first is Apple, Microsoft when for the first time it dépassa in 1996.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Overview ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is not all the innovations and who had the customer's preference and manufacture of the time - for example, IBM has failed the bet on an operational system own bones / 2 miracle online service or the IBM computer pcjr:</seg>
<seg id="33">"When your business is built on the movement in advance you can not émotionellement remain stuck in the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Why IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms, and when they do not work it out.</seg>
<seg id="35">Unlike for example of the conccurent Microsoft at the basis is and remains under the Windows operating system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">A technology perspective</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">IBM, services, who are trained in the income for a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a prominent place.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still in 1990 it was more of the motié participation with the most representative of hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">From the year 2000 IBM has sold assets with low yields for $15 billion, in cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of Technology Perspectives.</seg>
<seg id="40">It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has outstripped the new financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM according to the dictates of negotiating its head Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased the amount of investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">Now it transpires that IBM is the current crisis without being harassed.</seg>
<seg id="43">The price of the IBM has progessé rocket 120 percent from 2008, the net profit of the company continues to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The company's logo IBM is to change everything, but not its values.</seg>
<seg id="45">We can expect that to this giant flexible maitrise other crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">History of IBM, following the slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">IBM - International Business Machines - Society was born 100 years ago in New York; it initially had the name of complicated computing tabulating recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">It took the name IBM in 1924, initially it was a brand used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The basis of the future IBM was merging four firms whose history is linked to 80 of the ten year ninth century.</seg>
<seg id="50">They had older technologies such as the "pointeuses," US up that were the arrival and departure of employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was Charles ranlett flint until 1930 chaired the board of the company.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint embaucha the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then the leader was behind the scenes at the founder of the company - is based on the ideas of Watson until now the identity and culture of society.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson dirigea kusqu' firm in 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, as its name, began with the production of all possible machines for business - trancheuses cheese and meat to the cash registers.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the first four years in which Watson headed, the turnover is multiplia to reach $9 million and began the firm's expansion in all parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was irreplaceable for the company if that after 40 years of direction is her son, who held the seat of Director Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and was the first programming language.</seg>

<seg id="24">Washing windows, through the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, dust, strip the bathroom - and that twice a week.</seg>
<seg id="25">You made remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have sullied the lavabo encrassé the window of the hall of residence, and that gives you a lot of work?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">If you suffer precisely this obsession, try to remember that we should not exaggerate and that order and cleanliness must not be in the first place in the family.</seg>
<seg id="27">This desire but harmless of cleanliness can spoil your family relations and peace.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How have changed the fares since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia 5 travel agencies of State: cedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autotourist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agents at the time were offering travel in the country of the socialist bloc, because travel in the West were very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Czech tourists traveled to the holiday in East Germany, Soviet Union, Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea, Bulgaria, Romania - both at the Black Sea - and in Hungary - Balaton.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a fondness for the West, and travel to the Czech Yugoslavia were very limited for tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The great paradox of the socialist days was that it nétait not allowed for citizens of socialist bloc - also for the Czechoslovak - to travel within the framework of the socialist countries individually.</seg>
<seg id="7">Czechoslovak if they wanted to travel individually for example in Poland and the Soviet Union it needed a letter of invitation or the individual trip was not allowed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agents at the time were also travelling in the West but it was lining up all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" in the travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">And even after that it was not yet won.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agreement for the currency was the condition for travel to the West was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovak was not, however, échangeable currency and it was not possible to obtain money without the agreement of currency - Western currency - to travel to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Czechs are often holidays in the country where there were so many houses of campaign and chalets as the Czechs were buying and this usually lasts until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Travel for Czechs have since seen a great revolution since 1989.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the most, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries across the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The great paradox which we did not realise the most popular today is that the country is Croatia when it was not possible to move freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The abolition of visas in the 1990s of last century in the neighbouring countries of the West have caused a huge wave of short visits especially in Vienna in Austria and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">Long the Czechoslovak could not travel by plane to the West that everybody wanted to see at least a moment.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, Paris travel organisations were sleep the Czechs in tents in parks because our income does not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The typical feature of a journey of Czechs was at that time to secure itself with its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was also the interchangeabilité the Czech crown, which has allowed the tourists finally after decades of Western be free to buy the currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and the average salary rose which led around the year another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with by Air Charters, which links with contracts have tremendously reduces costs compared to what it was before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the late 1990s of last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries in the world the had later have facilitated our trips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-révolution, when exotic was prepared the first air charter to a country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since this year as moving every year of direct air charters of Czech tourists in the remote hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is more than 100000 exotic Czechs who visit the country each year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Still an interesting moment in this period, which symbolises our development post-révolution came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On 17 November 2008 the Czech has revoked visas for tourists and has enabled the country to stand completely in the developed countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history has spent more than half of their holidays abroad - 50, 3% and for the first time in history have spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for holidays abroad including the burdens annexes. kroner per person.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The General Assembly must find its President but it is likely to end with a situation without solution "pat"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nearly 5mois already Czech football is without a president and there is a risk that Ivan hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a general meeting to take place on Thursday at Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">But there is still no agreement on what vote we need regulation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jindrich - rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomas paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure has called his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only in the era after hasek Football came back to the differences between the chambers of the association that can not agree on a joint candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was completely shown on 16 September when he must choose a new president.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delegates from the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation has been blocked and there was not even about dealing with how to elect.</seg>
<seg id="10">There has been no agreement on the question of who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials have full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point there was a partial agreement for this moment with the help of office for the state and the law, that the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">The differences continue about the procedure for the election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned negotiations or extraordinary, did nothing to the situation</seg>
<seg id="14">The opinions on the voting possibilitě have changed several times, but the problem remains the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how can the third round to fall into the PAT.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The bone of contention is that is proceeding according to the statutes or find another model," was one of three vice presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda of professional football in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the rules of the candidate expected to win the third round of the model that percentage has received the most votes in the House for which he is a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw and what is the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes of both Houses.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Czech side considers the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Only then it would lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely denied the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits that includes the objections of the morave part and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the existing statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- it is surprising that Tomas paclik is also agreement even if he believes that the election rules established on the Statutes most pelta advantage among all the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I hope that the vote in all according to the statutes of the association."</seg>
<seg id="23">"To ensure that there is still no ideas ludicrous provided by a representative as in past general meetings," said the owner of Victoria Plzen which is a candidate for the first time and in its exposed is above all pelta defined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remain optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">He Nymburk there will be a new president, and believes that the candidates work together in the future together and constructive manner.</seg>
<seg id="26">"as possible today in Europe should calm throughout the World Championship."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Football will be on a wave of happiness and it one more more joy for cooperation" adds Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience of direction of both professional football at regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I believe in this Agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is not a problem between the Czech and Moravian, but there are trends to change the regulations to design."</seg>
<seg id="31">"That can cause another deadlock in the General Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that the sound right wins' rajchl said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">There is not much time left for a common agreement on all sides.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro, but who can tell if the whole direction of football is full for the match.</seg>
<seg id="35">The specially chartered flight in which should travel to podgorice among other deputies Dalibor Kucera and rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and we sought a variant for part of the Executive Committee on the ground of reprisals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">At the end of the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.</seg>
<seg id="37">The education minister of youth and sport Joseph dobes would be very happy to receive the strongest parts torn in the sports association in the country and encourage them to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the game there are many: a state grant, the credibility of the Czech football and also the General Assembly of the Union of Czech sports must determine the direction of the sport after the financial problems of SAZKA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclik goes to battle for the post of President, because he did not see any candidate correct.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the head of footballers - Plzen Tomas paclik saw before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to what he calls for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic - afrt - it would not be put into a campaign for this high office.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If there is such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I do not come to the election."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," said paclik the Czech News Agency - ctk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The motivation of paclik is to compete with Miroslav pelta and Jindrich rajchl to just try to prevent pelta Access at the head of the afrt which in theory would be given favourite for this election.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclik also points out that if it remporterait the year he held the post of president only until 2013 elections planned for a General Assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He would see an experienced manager and function at a high level but is not linked with the world of football.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I spoke with people who have the profile," he said.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was terrible for me when some said that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="48">"I would like to change that image," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What bothers, they say, paclik above all is the relationship between pelta and the President of the Union's regional football Plzen controversial novel berbr, man the reputation that is known in the wings as lobbyist capable delegated to influence the vote in the General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="50">For paclik it is not acceptable that pelta occupies the position of president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If he won, the state would remain and there is nothing new in the football."</seg>
<seg id="52">"And with the support of berbr, a trader from top flight football, it would be even worse," declared paclik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">This shocking is the fact that the name of pelta was pronounced a couple of years ago in tapping as part of an investigation into a case of corruption, for which pelta has emerged without any trouble.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what pelta would bring prestige to football."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And how would we be treated for UEFA and FIFA," said paclik, who said some time ago, "if pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">If paclik triompherait to Thursday's vote, it should prove that it could cooperate with felta.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, feel the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"It pelta, would be the first with whom I would."</seg>
<seg id="59">"It has great capabilities</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, it would be able to stand as head of the representation."</seg>
<seg id="61">"But as manager of the Association, it would not be able."</seg>
<seg id="62">"I am not the nose in what I do not know," says paclik in September has attracted a lot of attention when he called for the cancellation of the referees committee with ludek macela replaced Dagmar damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclik says it would be to lead the association.</seg>
<seg id="64">Example he takes her ability to lead of private firms and also runs since last year the club Plzen celebrated with its support in May its triumph in the first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to provide a certain culture."</seg>
<seg id="66">"I freinerais for example the influence of some interested groups which tend to influence the disciplinary committee and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste," said paclik does not chache his dislike for the head of Sparta Daniel kretinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">It would also be a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power lobby with the policies of high level would get more money for the sport of tax on the Games.</seg>
<seg id="68">"This is one of the key points that the new president should address."</seg>
<seg id="69">"If it is the tax on gambling as state political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paclik does not present its link with the Plzen club as something negative even if he says that the President of the afrt should be "above the parties."</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and rajchl with Dukla in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">I see no reason to convey my actions of the club Plzen to someone if I have to come back after a year and a half, "said paclik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta has promised new Statutes for the afrt should end to pat situations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one presidential candidate Miroslav pelta has promised that if he is elected, the afrt will have new statutes which should end in the future to squabbles over the rules for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="76">The official Jablonec is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the succés today to the representation of football should defuse this squabble before the vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta before the election in September which has not achieved has promised precisely to devote themselves to the national representation and achievement of financial resources, if he is elected.</seg>
<seg id="78">It has decided to be a candidate at the last moment before the last General Assembly and the delay of two months may allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broad context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People at all levels are football for a long time and expect that there is a president" Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="80">"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the association," it added, but above all, it is linked with the Jablonec club, has worked a number of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is also why it has enough experience to lead the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed in lépoque Ivan hasek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately at the General Assembly in June of statutes have been approved were not perfect as all have noticed."</seg>
<seg id="84">"If there were not all the various interprétattions we have already had a president since September," highlights pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It is the most important document review of the civic association that has caught the attention of delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I go, I take that as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibility if it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a principle without which we can not exist," said pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Then he tries, they say, not to deal with his opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">He said earlier that he can work with Jindrich rajchl he notes in his training in law and that he knows that his adversaire-candidat would be his first vice president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">He did not attack long tonas paclik instead continues to criticise pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">"It is in football for a year and has already had some succés."</seg>
<seg id="92">"However, its attacks were not the most honourable and has surprised many people during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," said pelta addressed to his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the statements he made in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His strongest weapon is according to his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level until the National réprésentation.</seg>
<seg id="95">This should be a vitirne of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"And I am also efforcerais to complete all the cases that begin with the bohémians or the result of the corruption scandal."</seg>
<seg id="97">"I entrerais immediate negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for the football," said the Czech News Agency ctk candidate 46ème two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">He also added that his appointment at the head of football does not bring any change of people.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he said Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Although there are catastrophic scenarios scheduled with the General Assembly, he believes that The delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we get to Overcome."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Football needs credibility and it gets his head when there is a new leader optimistic," as stated in pelta two days before the official probably decisive day for his career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the afrt start to work hard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">"If the current deputy Jindrich rajchl is elected president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that does not perhaps in large numbers of people, parait-il.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected starts to work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants systemic change and make the members of the executive committee are responsible for various areas of football.</seg>
<seg id="107">He has also promised to settle the matter bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA football, make more money and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"as President I want to play football as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="109">"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful youth football."</seg>
<seg id="110">"But I am not saying that I will do it only" rajchl said in an interview with ctk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and would distribute the powers in the Executive Committee so that each member is a certain area."</seg>
<seg id="112">"And I distribuerai difficult missions for the football against a big step forward."</seg>
<seg id="113">"A lot of people will not be happy, because we need to begin to work rather than criticise others," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">It reported said, that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="115">"On me, you know that I work 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"But I need to know if it is the coup and if I have people behind me that I will keep the obstacles and responsible doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.</seg>

<seg id="121">"There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone the end., he said with the fear that in the case of the election by Miroslav pelta the situation within the Union returns as it was before hasek.</seg>

<p>

<seg id="130">"There would not be a situation like now with only three Moravians team in the division because the problem is currently seeking of young players.</seg>

<seg id="3">By Julia stanek</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Pataugeoires view to ovni, magnificent swimming pools of Budapest: who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and having turned the town or a long promenade- can depend legs tired gas in water baths.</seg>
<seg id="5">A book shows how swimming pool you can experience more welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Along when Iris meder would travel research during the last 18 months, there is a subject which should not fail in his luggage, wearing swimming costumes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Expanded on his back in the water, it observa coupoles artistically balancing acts, and nageait against the marbles Putten who waited on the other side of the swimming pool and lacked admire the Art New meticulously restored these swimming pools converted.</seg>
<seg id="8">If he was like a swimming pool covered, it noted in his book worthy without delay all the details on the type of construction and the history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 swimming pools have been sondées in this way by the historian meder architecture and they have already presented in his book published: "badefreuden - bath joy." the municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic Palace of bath in the Black Forest, "concrete buildings hardcore" in the Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It brought its "trips to the most exceptional acts of Central Europe" in 13 countries in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The German 46 years is a real great bath of culture.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meder, explains that it does not have much interest in the sport but ell feels drawn to water in a completely different way.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is galling that fans of swimming should simply see blue carreaux and accommodate the stench of javel water while the joggers inhale the aroma envoûtant forests of épicéa or can listen to the gazouillement happy birds in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"One day I wondered why the swimming pools should always be if laides" The viennoise said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So I began a collection of fine spilled."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The surface of the water strengthens doubling the architecture</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">A volatile sauna drowned in a swimming pool and oils - factor in the swimming rooms are huge welfare because all are awake, according to meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builders would have given a little more effort, the rooms to swim could be a true délice for us: "instead of a floor has been an area of water in the swimming rooms."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand, however, reflects the beauty of the entire building."</seg>
<seg id="20">All surfaces are optiquement a double way: the voûtes high, carreaux multicoloured springboards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The volume of image of small badefreuden format is a worthy report 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the historic oasis of welfare - it certainly gives desire to make a leap in the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The collectionneuse remarkable meder found copies during its research in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alongside the spilled welfare splendid as the bath Széchenyi aged 100 in Budapest, it felt natural water containing nitrate in a cave in the Karst - cave in miskolc-tapolca bath - and a bath of Spas which the pools are filled with water containing the alcali and - városi termálfürdö in jászberény and are in a building in the form of bottle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the swimming pools heated in the air in Switzerland and Austria bath offers dramatic views, while a roof in Zurich was the whole city its eyes, you can admire the Arlberg enneigé from a swimming pool outside St. Anton: the Turkish bath is with a window from which one can see the animation on the runway of skiing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most extraordinary expects the concept of swimming pool swimmers do in längenfeld: the Aqua Dome ötztal resembles a ovni which has just landed in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">In winter, the steam is open three hills, while in the background are the ötztal mountains to the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The smell of javel water does not come from all the collection meder swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal spilled from a smell of sulphur, the árpád-spa in the Hungarian bekescsaba comes a strong smell of oil, it is difficult to believe, to find themselves in a spa health.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from the carbon alcalines therapeutic waters containing hydrogen, which is almost black and his Limon skin glue you as soon as you let slip in the swimming pool - a special experience of APS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">During its search along the beautiful swimming pools, Iris meder has also been disappointments: when she wanted to visit ADB free external luhatschowitz, a swimming pool and in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she has been faced with a barricadé ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bath designed by the architèque Dušan jurkovic in 1902 was now closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">Take a look through the window of the immeuble-art new rouge-blanc-jaune, she was the development of weeds between the carreaux.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">She was an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the ADB wildbad Palace of spas.</seg>
<seg id="35">The building has already survived three phases; you may find not only elements néo-romains released since its inception in 1844 but still a chamber maure Alhambra style that has been added in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since its careful modernisation of 1995, the palace spa remains the favourite bath along the expert in swimming pool, Iris meder - and not just because it is from Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is already a good return to melt styles of construction so different in a unit so great," said meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">With such a palace, plunged into the swimming pool thermale is apparently only a minor issue.</seg>

<seg id="3">By teevs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The German Bank abandonne-elle his speculation on the raw materials?</seg>
<seg id="5">According to information from spiegel-online, Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the leader of the group will then draw conclusions from it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg -</seg>
<seg id="8">For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: according to a study, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that banks rely on raw materials such as corn and wheat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent This avenue business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the result of an investigation forsa at the behest of the organisation of foodwatch consumers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report by foodwatch in middle of October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author Harald Schumann highlights in this article that speculation global stock exchanges on raw materials, pushing prices upward and banks have a complicity in global hunger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign to protect consumers aligns specifically against the head of the deutsche-bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to act in the same way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Speculation on the raw materials was initially introduced to protect the market against price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the majority of experts now share the opinion that the parieurs have posted offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ackermann reacted differently from American competitors criticism: it promised to investigate the accusations and said, "Nothing is worth to play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information from the Spiegel online foodwatch-report an International Working Group is currently investigating the accusations.</seg>
<seg id="18">The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of Deutsche Bank's board must be presented with recommendation, always.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the head of the Bank says the implications.</seg>
<seg id="20">This could result in a reduction in the commodities market, or even a complete abandonment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann built its image</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The head of foodwatch thilo bode welcomed the news, but at the same time has confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on rising food prices shows a draconian way, how banks today are detrimental to the general interest."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann is now the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Deutsche Bank must remove all the investments in its portfolio, for which money has been spent on food speculation" bode said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It matters little to Mr Ackermann, if it is starving people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The awareness of Ackermann may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group would present a picture perfect, a few months before leaving office.</seg>
<seg id="27">Deutsche Bank has announced Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change what is planned in the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ll could improve its image with a controversial agricultural abandonment of speculation.</seg>
<seg id="29">And on possible losses, it has not to care, his successor will be of. concern</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">One in two résilierait placements on raw materials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bode published a poll Tuesday, with which the 7 and 8 November the Institute forsa paid out questionnaires to 1001 people.</seg>
<seg id="34">Just 11 per cent have found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investors who bet on the price of food products are made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many customers of the bank would also personal consequences if they learned that their Bank participates in such operations: one on two résilierait, following the poll, all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on the raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="36">43% déconseilleraient such a bank in their environment, 49% said that they réfléchiraient the termination of their bank account to change of establishment.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The flag that has moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">To Ingeborg wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A history of architecture with ups, downs and a happy end: the Austrian flag for the global exposure of Brussels in 1958 won a prize, has been a museum in Vienna, was empty, then fell into ruin.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now it is once again open and took the place of homes of exposure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If there is enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, its clear forms, its glass sheds, becoming strong and bold and new construction materials that are typical of the belief to the technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the Brussels in 1958 Expo is a good and a famous example.</seg>
<seg id="7">The flag of schwanzer received Once the "great price architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction is seen as an important step to date in the contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">He made the architects so famous, he has also built following the Austrian flag for the Expo.</seg>
<seg id="10">With its legendary house adjacent to four cylindres BMW and its construction in the form of bowl in Munich, it finally became famous at international level in 1973.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">His flag as a temporary construction project was exposed after the Swiss Expo in the garden at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and a museum of the 20th century has opened in 1962 -</seg>
<seg id="12">But it was not physically and technically suitable for a museum - no walls to accomplish the works of art, not a good environment.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it was also long used, until the contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and has become increasingly worn out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf krischanitz has transformed the flag, it now bears the name of "house of the 21st century" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.</seg>
<seg id="16">The museum Belvédère opened Tuesday evening, which the House is the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The new start has been carried out by Agnès husslein-arco, which has become the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvédère in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-arco, has promoted a historian of art to a significant career between different in his youth patineuse artistic, subsequently sotheby' 's home, the museum Guggenheim and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, it has been particularly to the renovation work on the politicians and the protection of monuments, it has received public funds and private sponsoring and has established the exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Except the contemporary art, Fritz wotruba sculptor whose works the foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a coffee and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict monitoring, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the achievement krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because he had changed and expanded with the secession of Joseph olbracht sensitivity and that he had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was "an extremely important place where he had seen" exhibitions "virtually every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and casual following his trip to Vienna and by his change of use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current changes, there were major problems: the energy structure was "an abyss," said krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The profiles of glass windows facades were changed, the glass insulating glass fibre reinforced was raised and the roof replaced by a special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">The thermal poutrelles bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and the floor filled with asbestos were awaited.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basement to accommodate the new operation, a display of light tamisé between the house and the road is lighting, a bridge leading to the Entry - it is almost a new construction, but still the slight schwanzer flag.</seg>
<seg id="28">The external doors have origins, the House is painted as a protection against the colour, rouge-brun.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the film room is identical to what it was.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all this under close supervision of authorities for monuments and with a small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often the materials that are good and very expensive had to be found, and also like the Office of protection," said krischanitz monuments and it draws attention to a dry soil in a basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the constraints, the problems and the changes, the building was flexible and light.</seg>
<seg id="33">It would have been difficult with the flag, "which stemmed from Brussels," said krischanitz recently, a typical of "drop-in-the-city story."</seg>
<seg id="34">Such an architecture is always in the wrong place and still wants to "awaken the conscience."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because there is a stroke of luck for urban construction: Swiss around the garden is precisely the "district of the Central Station all newly planned, with offices and flats.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another stroke of luck may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the support of another krischanitz construction, because the collectionneuse Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary Art Center there, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to get a Swiss site in the vicinity of garden.</seg>

<seg id="1">The threat is palpable</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the discovery of the zwickauer cell 'German the Turkish media have doubts about the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which renaîtrait now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The killing of eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek company in 2000 to 2006 had a background of extremism.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following this news, Turkey and the population germano-turque reacts with fear and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because for many germano-turcs spectrum long thought dead back his appearance: since the attacks mölln inflammatory in November 1992 and solingen in May 1993, there was no longer any comparable with This right wing extremist violence against the Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was a xenophobia in Germany, it has ever been.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the right wing extremist network, which has been detected reveals the scale of the scale is far from predictable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"is a return to the ideology of bloody," "That was the title of the haberturk Turkish newspaper's publication on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the newspaper Sabah highlights that one of the perpetrators would have been a v-homme of the protection of the constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of the extreme right.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is reasoned that was the Turkish community in Germany: has called this weekend in a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German political and Turks had thought to a ceremony germano-turc recruitment of the 50th anniversary of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is with gaies colours that cohabitation was staging, symbolizing a history of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Some Turkish media reports are the result of a blow: "Germany's gift for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the turque- platform "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the German publication of "hürriyet" DO NOT deny to draw clear conditions.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It starts to puer" is the title of the Chronicle of Ahmet külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">It stresses that people have been killed, have paid taxes and would have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police action has been seen very critically on the germano-turcs forums and they had discussed the success of their research.</seg>
<seg id="19">Why it has not already come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities suspect to make searches in some quarters of extreme right, finds the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="20">More than one is prepared at least to rhetorical or drastic means: "if the case continues to be rushed, it will remain to nothing other than the migrants themselves and arms."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will be the best self-defense."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," wrote, "selen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of mölln and solingen in the 1990s have illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photograph of the ruins after the fire in German and Turkish solingen is deeply rooted in the memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event has shown more clearly the Turks living here that there is a credible threat, and the Germans, on which the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.</seg>
<seg id="26">The attacks, however, have aiguisé a sense of the US in the Turkish community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Never repeat the mistakes of the past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Once it is the failure of the German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complaint: Helmut Kohl has refused to visit the survivors of mölln.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the fire solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the leader of the Turkish State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how local taxes was the Turkish population.</seg>
<seg id="30">As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of their tax burden.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The current Turkish media report shows once more how many germano-turcs is deep mistrust of the state of local law since that date.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition to the efforts of further clarification and revaluation of terrorism of the extreme right in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The bank scandal of Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Bank more expansionist Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS has claimed almost collapse in the financial crisis and patina Meanwhile from one crisis to another.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a German who must move now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was seen in July, 2013, a post he was almost as spectacular, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, has welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its strong recently introduced and passed kind comments on the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"UBS has passed the turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">And yet, from the September it was clear that everything will change.</seg>
<seg id="11">A merchant of UBS Securities in London diverted all the bank's security systems and had soared approximately 1.7 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The head of the Board of the UBS Oswald grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, has had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">The President of the Board of UBS has seen since with - and all asking: when Axel Weber does finally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the Bank from February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker, much more economy professor and chairman of the bank, and it would have needed a period of adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="18">In one fell swoop it bears the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has to prove once again that it has long since earned the title of "the biggest bank scandal in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, the UBS is a huge hand - Until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it patina for years a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, saving the Swiss bank so proud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the asset manager Switzerland, silent and sound, but also crafty, was combined with ambitious targets: it also wanted to become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank.</seg>
<seg id="24">Therefore the UBS has a hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, had advanced as Investment Bank in the league of the world's largest banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This has been feeling.</seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker Hans Geiger and later Professor of for many years in Zurich bank says: "I have always taken the bank UBS as a model of good with my students."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In the current approach, we wonder: How do I could simply be wrong at this point?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is deeply wrong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, it became apparent that something was not right for the first time at UBS.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year President Peter wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was once seen as a top banker and a great intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later it was considered for why he was gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The division of the bank had soared with sub-prime documents and has had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To support this, the UBS has announced a capital increase worth 13 billion francs and made a cross over.</seg>
<seg id="35">For that she has indeed found investors, but that might shortly before froncé frown: an Asian background of State non-transparent from Singapore and bottom of Arab state, which was ignored, to the point that it has never even heard his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This was the first blast.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008 it has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Bank was expected to announce new losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel ospel who was still the second Board in 2006 the best paid in Switzerland, were sacked.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors in the financial crisis before the crash and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank has bought the UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become copropriétaire of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Throughout Switzerland has been shaken - because she has noted how this could be disastrous for a small country, of harboring such large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the assessment of UBS's total 2007 are éleva at more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland - see graph.</seg>
<seg id="43">"We could not save the UBS once again," said the researcher from banks, Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">After the first disaster this was followed by the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and has declared itself ready to publish the data from the wealthy clientele, which had been fraud tax perhaps with the help of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million in higher reimbursement of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The UBS has more or less published it had helped to tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal the Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">It followed the withdrawal of the head of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of customers' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The bank had lost credibility in a few months in the two main areas of business: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of the support for tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And, as he was somewhat a return to calm, and as it did, that UBS would manage, he followed in this unfortunate history of merchants of title: one merchant title increased 1.7 billion, before the bank will have no choice but to admit that something was not right.</seg>
<seg id="54">And being published: with the risk management by Investment Bank that still does not seem to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"with the case adoboli, it was clear that the risk control to too little changed," said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">As the financial director of a large German bank is safe: "The UBS's problem is that it does not control risks in hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">However it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss Bankers had long taken their function, that to become a guardian of the world's great fortune: not too big, but the security risks for the money - and the world could well fall beyond the Alpine republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">The treasures of the Swiss banks have become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt and sprüngli are at a particularly noble chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The heart of the UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the sound cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is just a little more.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now the situation is a classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its headquarters in the central station in Zurich, which led directly to the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the summits enneigés Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The prestigious buildings are here, the rental shops are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">The bijoutiers as tiffany' s, we find them here between the Swiss traditions as well as those of the confectionery sprüngli stores.</seg>
<seg id="64">Swiss bankers have been here for centuries: the Swiss National Bank through the palace of credit to elitist private banks as Julius bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">You arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside, the walls are in stone, which are épaisses leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the bank, a major label for "safe."</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer research here: security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank has one day out of the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and credit, Switzerland, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank found.</seg>
<seg id="69">It ultimately would prefer not to read his name in the paper, like all the Swiss Bankers IT Business with the two big banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS became too great, trouve-t' it - especially in investment banking, where the Saxon would be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss no longer have anything to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And even though they have long been adapted to the habits of the Saxon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">This was indeed the Members that has changed the investment bank UBS, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime LIKE THE GREAT Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="75">"On Wednesday the coalition government of small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation," the author Lukas hässig wrote in his book "The crash of the UBS."</seg>
<seg id="76">With up to 68 billion francs around, or 45 billion, the politicians have agreed to save of the large bank failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How is this pouvait-il happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If we are talking with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank has been created, which was already too big to little Switzerland - and was constantly increasing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Which has helped, is that the two banks prédécesseuses different from the UBS have completed: a rich, but lethargy bank with strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already strong International.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the international investment banks have been much access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of the UBS, and Marcel ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I have always thought that wuffli and ospel constituted a dream team," said the researcher from banks, Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which is very well in models and statistics, and ospel, intuitif, who has fought her way to the summit with the learning of the bank."</seg>
<seg id="86">But ospel would have trust until the end wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And wuffli probably committed at the end of a crucial mistake: "He thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"This is a tragic fall."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">The staff of the UBS remembers clearly the rallies in which the leader of the group leaders wuffli said always the same slogan: détrôner Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The US bank was the world's most powerful Investment Bank.</seg>
<seg id="93">It has ordered the "league tables" rankings, which have documented at the time the success of banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">After all, the UBS wanted to climb to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps have already succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="96">In case of currencies and securities transactions has played a very important role.</seg>
<seg id="97">Business advisers, who have had the responsibility, however, have highlighted a weakness: in the international operations of banking interests, in the jargon fixed income, "there is a huge difference between the major banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS would have shortcomings in the products of American mortgages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill this gap, the UBS has launched into an adventure, which has almost cost him his life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, it is also the Bank itself that a fund management created before it in investments sub-prime Americans who have invested.</seg>
<seg id="101">It has turned into a massive machine that has wrapped and put the documents of value based on US mortgages - but has also retained the risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Even when other banks have long sought to end.</seg>
<seg id="103">"in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was in flames, the UBS has bought here," said Geiger, the banking expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">The greater the euphoria over the fall is brutal.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after another has left, when attempts to stop has proved more difficult than had been thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Jobs at UBS have become éjectables and are so far bancaux.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Anyone who runs large bank has an almost impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="108">He needs to find a strategy for a bank, suggested that all the business models have disappeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the Investment Bank, concentration in the management of property, return to Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">But the Bank does not - yet - go too far.</seg>
<seg id="111">But the Investment Bank should it wither vigorously, where it is clear so far.</seg>
<seg id="112">On Thursday the head of Sergio ermotti Bank wants to present to the world its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">The italo-suisse was only supposed to be transitional 51 years old when the bank has separated with his predecessor grübel surprise.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, it has imposed: it must hold permanently the affairs of the UBS, announced Tuesday the bank in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank with the progress of the mid 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">It cancels 3 500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Which is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">What is making money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly.</seg>
<seg id="122">It said publicly until now only that he would seek with his wife an apartment in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<seg id="5">In the first ostfriesisch Symposium on the corneilles, experts have said that it is no longer possible to expel the freux towns.</seg>
<seg id="6">Experts from Germany discussed possible solutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They are looking for alternatives in cities</seg>
</p>

<seg id="9">It is not so much a book about what happened, accounts, a paper describing what it could be. "it contains the feelings and impressions, experiences and moods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"The beauty and the sorrow" summarises the experiences in War 20 ordinary men and women more or less, on both sides of the war, young schoolchildren and botanistes escaladeurs, from doctors, ambulanciers and sellers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Other prisoners of war, and some lose members, will become insane or will lose their lives.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives wavering here as the cierges a church: while some becoming extinct, we rallume new ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Traditional the book by Peter Englund departs from the history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It provides a corrective to the idea that the First World War is only by the terrible war in the trenches on the Western Front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The beauty and the sorrow" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and eastern Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book are under the hives; one is Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tsé-tsé are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This book is moving from the first page.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina which pue cordite.</seg>
<seg id="20">When gun barrel roar away, and that you are a mother at home, are you staying or fuyez-vous?</seg>
<seg id="21">Which will anyway?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost no one can understand what happened, or the reasons for the war.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Peter Englund, the lack of facts was amplified by the assumptions of the hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty and the sorrow" follows those such as Florence farmborough, an English nourrice in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.</seg>
<seg id="26">Versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small, isolated moments and details.</seg>
<seg id="27">Most tackle deprivation and the ability to cope.</seg>
<seg id="28">By sharing the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "substitute, ersatz everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="29">'replacement, forged aluminum coffee, rubber, paper bandages imitation, wooden buttons. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It continues on the food of replacement in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">It describes the "meat made rice cooked sheep crushed in fat - and ended with a fake wood bones; tobacco made with dry skin and dried roots of potatoes; wooden soles of shoes."</seg>
<seg id="32">He says that "Permitted 837 alternative meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also alternative 511 cafes."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories address the honour and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American acknowledges its own pulsion to savagery and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, is what the men were targeted, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that this means veneer of civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your shirt empesée and cloutée.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier realizes that it likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay any attention.</seg>
<seg id="36">"When one is resigned to sacrifice themselves, we hope to have an audience," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, this is rather like "a condemned man struggling in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other Comments About the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war between the factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">It captures the arrival of what he called "a new species in the bestiaire at the beginning of the century: a mass murderer well articulated and convinced ideologically, carved up clothes, which executes its slaughter while sitting behind a desk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People act unexpectedly; there are so many basic behavior of heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who tried to catch a disease at any price vénérienne from prostitutes to avoid the service at the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"is the most grotesque expression in the trade of more due to the gonorrhée, that the soldiers buy and range on the genital organs in the hope of finally to hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Desperate to apply it on the eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the Swede Peter Englund by Peter serious, the prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of short scenes, it captures the way the war has caused "uncontrollable forces exclusively: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."</seg>
<seg id="47">People are starting to ask why their leaders are in a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books on the First World War are often indirect, such as' Great War and Modern Memory "- the Great War and modern memory of Paul Fussel, or" Western anything new, "Erich Maria remark, rather than complete.</seg>
<seg id="49">Peter Englund's book is a conventional pantheon little.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The end of the book is the most devastating that I have read in a non-fictionnelle work.</seg>
<seg id="51">I do not will reveal it.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized on your hands this page, which contains the list of people and scorched with a match.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Union of school aid continues the city for layoffs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Union, which represents hundreds of school who lost their jobs last month provides aid to take unnecessary Wednesday a trial in the city for redundancies and discriminatory, a disproportionate impact on schools that receive disadvantaged schoolchildren.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the Union, 37e district council, to try to reverse the redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred 72 aid coordinators of parents and other school employees, as part of the lowest wages in the city, have lost their jobs on 7 October, union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political campaign for not having left the city into a fund for health care, led by groups of workers, and that would have helped to close the budget gap in the spring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing of the city Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget concluded in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the Council hit back with school aid, stating that the redundancies were not specified in the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The Council's 37e district officers have said that they rempliraient advice to appeal, saying the Department of Education, it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dennis Mr Walcott and the Department of Education of the city will be the defence and the plaintiffs will be represented by eight workers made redundant, all black or school of Latin American origin, as most of the aid that have lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the city has not yet seen the reasons of the trial and therefore can not comment on the allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft obtained by the New York Times, the Union miserait complaints about the number of redundancies in the schools of the poorest districts of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most funding because of a regular underfunded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and some just in Upper East Side school or Tribeca, 17 aid schools have lost their jobs in the twenty-third Brownsville district, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of the South Bronx districts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of school children live in poverty, the prosecution claim that "this is not an area of affluent parents who can bring budget funds to fill the gaps."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The public school 36 budget has been reduced by 3,26% this year, and funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each entry is disadvantaged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Union also says that the directors of colleges have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memo employed the term "overshoot" to describe the action, even if "overshoot" more generally described the action to move a teacher in a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the draft of complaints, "66 coordinators of parents have been dismissed," and "not only because of excess."</seg>

<seg id="1">Completed mission: Congress reaches an agreement on the issue of Libya</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Ultimately, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="3">It took an uprising succeeded, long the capture and death of dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry, Democrat - massachussetts, with Senators John McCain, Republican - Arizona and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent - Connecticut, welcoming the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans when they begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, and with the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions to approve or reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of military forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The genuine bipartisan Bill was defeated by a wide margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Representatives has also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">The US mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory - The legislative Congress even annoyed enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug from under the feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli has fallen below the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO mission has officially ended on October 31.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Senate can now act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "extraordinary congratulate the Libyan people for their courage and determination in order to freedom" and "Congratulate the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and professionalism that is fantastic."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="20">The senator and president of the independent commission Richard D. Lugar - opposed the latest version.</seg>

<seg id="23">The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob goodlatte, Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without having tried.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The amendment of goodlatte is part of 68 Constitutional amendments have been presented to Congress, on a wide range of subjects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are frequent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations on a precedent.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are at least 15 in the House only versions of the amendment to a balanced budget, and another handful who are said to control federal spending.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want sweetening their CV - the chance to claim to be the author of such a measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The Law on control of the budget - Budget Control Act approved in August called the House and the Senate's vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators soft we voted in favour of a resolution endorsing the idea of such an amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several Members want to limit the number of mandates in which members of Congress can be used, while José E. Serrano - Democrat - NEW YORK - want to lift the limit of two terms for the Presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jesse L. Jackson Jr. - - Illinois Democrat - has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.</seg>

<seg id="34">Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So eager were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the 111e Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110e.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As well, most of the conversations on the nails are confidence among the veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">After the return of his two sons in the battle with the Marine Colonel mark Cancian pensioner has warned that the public decide their service from two perspectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Some people would watch with respect, since they have been faced with insurgents and have travelled to distant lands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Others ask if a veteran angry and violent "lies beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the government in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">When he sought a job, he said, he felt that some people who were putting the interviews were so subtle him if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after her return from battle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"When you raise the subject of service, you have negative impressions," recalls the Colonel Cancian when he speaks of his son.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The difficulties of military arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.</seg>
<seg id="27">The victories are rarely acknowledged in a country more familiar with the army and who sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"As a nation, we no longer valorisons heroism in the same way as in the Second World War," said Lt. Gen. David barno pensioner, who led the troops in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the military focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a people.</seg>
<seg id="30">Troops are recognized for the number of services endured periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injury.</seg>

<seg id="1">The army against the growing pressure of punishing rapists</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for an alleged inaction on rape.</seg>
<seg id="3">The case, hundreds of plaintiffs prepare the next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The soldier from 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was in October 2008. returning to their barracks Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dîné with a friend, when she visited a colleague with a pack of beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was asked if he could join his house for a drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It was a warning signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Texas the has set aside runs its concern.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: no, he was 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is of Texas' Commission.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I have had to follow my intuition."</seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after entered the house of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind prétend-elle, thrown on the ground and raped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others do not, will wait anxiously the historic court ruling at a trial that will take place in Arlington, in Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial brought against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape in the military, undercutting the constitutional rights of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial was initially 17 complainants, and this number has risen to 28 months following - 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers; they also claim that the army was not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Susan Burke says targeting the military galonnées, because the problem begins with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The army is a vertical structure" she.</seg>
<seg id="18">"People are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The lawyer also says that since February, it has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="20">His strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all your eggs in one basket - it pursue several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil macbride has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Legal documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the disbursement of the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army can not be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a Supreme Court decision in 1950, called the feres doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by the staff active.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Alleged evil is inherent in the military service of plaintiffs' show the documents.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Defense Department has refused to make any comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">While officially, women still do not have the right to go to battle, this distinction is included on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only men.</seg>
<seg id="28">Women in Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers play an increasingly important role, particularly for contact with local women.</seg>
<seg id="29">Result: on the two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two thirds in a state of war.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time for the army to modernise says Susan Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She is not alone in this battle: three other trials are underway in most of its members.</seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School, the centre of Legal Services veterans is preparing a case against the four main Military Academies for allegedly encouraging an atmosphere misogynist.</seg>
<seg id="33">On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a case against the army, by focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" awarded to rape victims to give them leave - relatively normal, according to the activists such as Anu bhagwaru Service Women's Action Network, military action network of women, a group for human rights.</seg>
<seg id="34">His group has brought a lawsuit in December to the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of applications for benefits for those claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine bills independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of Senators and Representatives, with different solutions.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded from the centre of Intervention and Prevention of sexual assault, sexual assault prevention and response office from the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is underestimated, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, the figure is approximately 13.5% of 19,000 incidents this year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecution: in 2010, 20% of the cases in the army have been the subject of a civilian trial - half the percentage of the judicial system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the case of Lyman it informs the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the event.</seg>
<seg id="41">That night, she asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape to various police, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has undergone a "rape kit" - literally a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker - due to a cut on his arm - was found in his bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge in a trial in which it asked about his sexual relations with her boyfriend before the day of his aggression.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people have shown as witnesses of morality and the author of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day when the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought I had to start having contractions. I have started to cry after the court."</seg>
<seg id="47">"I have been placed in the psychiatric unit, and when I am out, I remember saying to my master" that was not his trial but mine. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Elizabeth military Lyman was forced to see a psychiatrist, who came to diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit to serve.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, has been put under the terms less than honourable, preventing him from receiving advantage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whether the case Lyman and other complainants progress or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, law professor at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, it said, "In my view, they should be able to move forward."</seg>
<seg id="52">Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.</seg>
<seg id="53">I have always criticised the feres doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by the responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try," it added.</seg>
<seg id="56">These things change only when the good guys are willing to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, includes its hundreds of other plaintiffs to trial.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Where until we mourrions, one or the other of the two options.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders breivik Behring was just a guy anti-immigration expressing their views online.</seg>
<seg id="3">Monday, breivik, who has admitted having been taken to a murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, has faced its first trial.</seg>
<seg id="4">When breivik acted alone, it was far from being on the cyberspace: he had spent a lot of time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme right groups on social networking sites.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how can find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy... connectez-vous Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We realised that it was not so difficult that at home," says Jamie Bartlett, main author of a recently published report by the Reflection Group demos on the digital populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Facebook is so full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett advertising, that researchers could simply use the tool of the site to find the people they are seeking with scientific precision - how the mercaticiens do for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe, it has targeted with announcements, but instead to link them to a new group or product announcements invited users to respond to an inquiry and the questions related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When they come into contact with them through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask 10,000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some are not at all surprising results: the right wing groups are more online supporters of men, Young and against immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But surprisingly, those who associate online activism and hors-ligne are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The study of demos is just one example of how Facebook has become the key new tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tanks, medical researchers and analysts use the site to assess all the issues that affect the health issues as Social Trends, thanks to "I love," Publications on the walls and updated statutes.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, the supernova data creates an explosion in research, increasing the amount of research that the site's name appears in the form of nearly 800% over the last five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not move in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Before, when you are attempting to carry out investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You go to the party, but they do you would never have allowed to," says Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook avoids this - you have direct access to their information."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the social and health problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a recent study of the University of Wisconsin-Madison D. Megan Moreno, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploits with alcohol in their blood were much more likely to be alcoholics that students discreet.</seg>
<seg id="24">Megan Moreno suggests that the fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and perhaps intervene to help a student whose status speaks often of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You ca n't address a problem if you do not diagnostiquez," Dimitri Christakis, an author of Megan Moreno and Director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Research Institute for children is located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We know how to identify the children at risk, and in another case would not be recognised."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also constantly access information of its users.</seg>
<seg id="28">The team from the site that deals with data has studied the statistics on the love and the day of the saint by rivals Valentin situation, the rate of participation in the upcoming elections in 2010 and a National Happiness Index - Thanks to information only available digital - the champions of freedom have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to other people for research purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">But Facebook users know that the site is that their liking or not - in power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed access to your information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they have not heard?</seg>
<seg id="31">While the researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information via the Internet, other than it is anything else online.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought that a researcher can consider their profile," said Neil Selwyn sociologist knowledge laboratory in London, according to a study in 2006 that he conducted with the Facebook walls of her students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"As far as they know, exchanges were seen by their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then comes the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth or on the wall of a user profile.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What you say on Facebook and what you are doing it are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn believe a technological bloc-notes and a pen are the best tools that can be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with the people," he states.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Social Studies are meant to address the social aspect - and the social, not in front of a computer."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders breivik Behring</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders breivik Behring, the man who admitted having organised the two attacks which have been 77 deaths in Norway this summer, is described as a "Resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial taking place in Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and templiers audience of Norway," accounts in a room full of 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Regarding the competence of the Court, I reject it, because you want your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I acknowledge the facts but I am not guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The judge torkjel breivik nesheim interrupted during this monologue because it "did not want to give him the opportunity to use the trial to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason, it has refused to breivik, who has brought with it a speech on paper, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge nesheim has also asked the police to keep breivik in custody 12 more weeks, he was forbidden to speak to the media for four weeks and has warned that the authorities surveilleraient very closely all the visits and connections for eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Some 30 survivors and relatives of victims were present at the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some breivik came hoping to look in the eyes, others to be sure that it will be placed behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="11">All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of the Norwegian television channel NRK utoya.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I was not comfortable, but I personally have a bit further having seen and heard the suspect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, breivik has remained calm and professional throughout the trial he saw the journalists and the survivors in the eye in entering and leaving the court.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the bizarre idea that breivik belongs to a broad movement of "resistance," the Judge determined that he was not crazy. He also said that there is no evidence he did with accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which réconfortera perhaps some.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this does not reduce the pain or the confusion felt by the entire nation.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I have preferred that he looks like a monster, but that is not the case," said a relative of a victim.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would have been much easier."</seg>

<seg id="1">Lost 7 from the interview of Steve Jobs, the cinema this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - distinguishing itself by the technical engineering and inventor of the modern computer.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs back recently and which will be published this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative spirit understood the process and work flow of products.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was no doubt a Creator and a dreamer. He identified a hippie but was also very meticulous and organised, and a améliorateur charts - a man who believed that many managers were suffering a "disease leaving think a clever idea is 90% of the work...... but a lot of manual work between a clever idea of a product of exception."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob cringely develops the television series "triumph of the nerds." This series runs through the birth of the computer, and it sits for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">This time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave apple. it was already hard on his new computer company next to a popular adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of the interview with cringely is used in nerds, he says that the main copies have disappeared in transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is only after the death of Steve Jobs as a comprehensive video is found in the garage of the filmmaker.</seg>
<seg id="9">This video, slightly resurgence is the basis of the film on 68 minutes, Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, which will be distributed to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone known to detest the detailed discussions, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose philosophies technology and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly carefully.</seg>
<seg id="12">At four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, when Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discover also moments when the perfectionnisme of Steve Jobs ressurgit, where it seems anxious to hear the issues of cringely, giving him little shoulder to speed up and take or issues of major importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before the age of pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient on lost interview. Steve Jobs assesses what it considers good or bad for the other companies and has made its own view on the future of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to read posthumes assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and based on the rights that we see here, the Dreamer anxious on the verge of greatness.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things can be and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is then put on them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For a quick summary of seven outstanding sequences of lost interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">On the way he has learned to manage a company:</seg>
<seg id="20">"during all these years, I have always asked: why are you doing it?" and the answers are always the same: "Oh, simply because we need to make them."</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why, no one is in depth of things in a company.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is what I have discovered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Steve Jobs is giving details of its efforts to simplify accounting for apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffled as to how the costs were recorded - often begins with a "standard" estimated to cost to nose, then adjusted with a variation - it has developed an automated factory which ensures the precise calculation of trading costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On the opportunity to play a round the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Steve Jobs tells the story of the blue box that he has created with Steve Wozniak - a device which helped to PIRATER telephone networks and telephone longue-distance free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="27">The device has been the subject of numerous written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the blue box as an act of appropriation is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">It describes how he and Wozniak have tested using a public telephone box, and an appeal can be connectant a network AT & T to another while circumventing satellites as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We enveloppions crystal different things and you hurliez half a dozen times in the public telephone and that you came a minute later in public telephone in hand," explains riant jobs.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and with this blue box ourselves, we have learned that we could create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">We both did not know much, but we have been able to invent a small thing capable of controlling things; it was an incredible lesson one day, and I do not believe that Apple would have existed without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Steve Jobs is by sharing a wonderful round that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the blue box in the middle of the night in masquerading as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="33">While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are mad laugh just before the pope himself is awakened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On his love with the technology - and doorstep selling of Bill Hewlett:</seg>
<seg id="35">The age of 12 years ago, the hunt for spare parts to build a fréquencemètre, is seeking the number of Bill Hewlett in the book and it requires a phone call.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after their conversation in 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a summer job part time at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It has had a tremendous influence on me, it was the only company that I had seen at this age and it has formed my definition of a company, and how employees are treated."</seg>
<seg id="38">Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the research laboratories in the company, based in Palo Alto, where he found the "first office computer ever designed."</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as big as a suitcase, had a small tube cathodique. I am falling in love.</seg>
<seg id="40">The teenager that I was has returned from HP and began to write programmes for this machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On improvisation innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">Has several times in the interview, Steve Jobs is to invent new products on a whim.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the beginning of his career, when he is to sell a few cards printed circuits, a customer asked to assemble a complete computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working at only 30 days of credit, he dût address the Assembly and finished the delivery of aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties to develop a computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember Many disputes... I am criait above, arguing that it would take five years... to manufacture a mouse that cost $300. I have had enough, I am out and went to see a designer."</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we can produce for $15, which was incredibly reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On the essoufflent big business:</seg>
<seg id="49">Well before it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs anticipated how many industrial leaders were wrong and losing control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">"recognise that you work for IBM or Xerox, you better copier and printer, and after?"</seg>
<seg id="51">So you have the monopoly of the market, the company does not have more success.</seg>
<seg id="52">Sales and Marketing can change, so... they are the types of people who end up leading companies and officials in product are sidelined for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can not imagine design a good product for a bad product - the manual work required.</seg>
<seg id="54">That is what happened in Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox could hold the computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It could have been 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...</seg>
<seg id="57">They have scored the defeat to victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On innovation as a form of art:</seg>
<seg id="59">"A huge part of manual work between a clever idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and growing."</seg>
<seg id="60">You learn a lot on its intricacies.</seg>
<seg id="61">Any compromise... there are some things you can not do, électrons can, glass, incredibly, factories.</seg>
<seg id="62">You have to keep thousands of things in mind, these concepts it by assembling it to each other.</seg>
<seg id="63">Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste. it is trying to explain to the best products that men have created, and try to make these things that you create product.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso once said that good artists copy, AND THAT GREAT artists fly.</seg>
<seg id="65">We have always ashamed to fly with excellent ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">That is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional: the people who worked on were musicians, poets, zoologistes, historians, who are simply proved the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">If not for computer science, they have done an excellent job in another area.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The day when the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political disagreement about whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who defend the case to the High Court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges are gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases in question was a trial by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at national level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The justices agreed to hear the complaint, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected in March, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing at a time when the Tribunal's decision will be made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will stand before the court and argumentera on the rejection of the law, will probably be Paul Clement, who has served as a general solliciteur us during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of soft, pllc Bancroft, was part of two dozen firms that have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society, Federalist Society, a conservative legal group dedicated to defend the principles for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another cabinet which has sponsored the dinner, Jones day, represents one of the trade associations who have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another developer has been the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's conference on the case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was, among other things, Mitch McConnell there declared, top Senate Republican and opponent of the health law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Hot the guests for dinner? scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the federalist society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is nothing that goes against the rules of conduct.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the Code of Canon 4C, which reads: "A judge can attend collections of funds related to the right and other organizations that the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the programme of such an event."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">However, the mere presence of scalia and Thomas close to two law firms of the case, and a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court upholds the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of common cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges buvaient and dînaient and a collection of Gala fund with lawyers with cases pending before the court."</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds from this event to dismantle any complaint of impartiality, and is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily cases to the court with the agenda of groups such as the federalist society.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the wife of Thomas, ginni, is a conservative activist haut-profil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Moreover, the conservatives argue that the judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was solliciteur general in the Obama administration when the first opposition to the bill has been referred to the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id="25">His critics have lobbied for Kagan to object to hear the case, saying it was too invested in defense of the law to be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan gave no indication that it would.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Mexican President's sister clearly beaten in elections to the Michoacán</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Luisa Maria Calderon says that the drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo the PRI in the race for the post of Governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its bid for access to the post of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and has declared Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of its opponents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the top of the race for the post of governor of this state of the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio in an interview on Monday following the elections.</seg>
<seg id="6">"They have threatened our candidates, our election agents... they have taken over the ballot boxes, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote for the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until losing the presidency in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it organizes its return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in that effort.</seg>
<seg id="9">The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Vallejo seems to not be unusual little Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.</seg>
<seg id="11">Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognise Vallejo as winner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Silvano left aureoles, Candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 for this divided and unhappy left.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aureoles has also refused to recognize the results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Vallejo, former Mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any link with the drug traffickers and has urged the other candidates to accept the results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialising in the smuggling of marihuana, heroin and méthamphétamine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the home state of President Calderon, and he has chosen the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the violence has persisted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A week before the elections a pan was murdered when he campaigned for mayor Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned locally in the campaign by fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">But for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections of Michoacán have the air, a victory will help the party in its tracks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think that this victory is very encouraging for the next year."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a fall in the long term to prevent the development of the Asian economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat Nag, the Director General of the basd based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the faster growth of the world should "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the eurozone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It is inadvisable to BRIC - Brazil, Russia, India and China - to look at the problems of Europe of a "indifferent eye" and indicated that an Asian financial support with the leaders and resources of Europe would avoid a collapse of the world economy in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are all together in this crisis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"So anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Asia can be protected up to a point but it is not safe."</seg>
<seg id="8">"If China and India can help, that there is nothing stopping them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In recent months, the euro area has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, Italy's cost of borrowing is dangerously soared and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The flourishing of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe did discover the worry that the global economy is in recession, and gave rise to the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro zone to find a solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mr Nag Asian présagé that the IMF acheminerait any aid, but he has also said that the bilateral aid - as buying bonds in the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater power to negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Anand Sharma, India's Minister for Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro zone as its economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a decreased the influx of foreign capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"No one wants the eurozone remains unstable and troubled," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We have a monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because when trouverions-nous work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans when they are facing their own economic challenges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ashutosh varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"One day, they discover that the Greeks retire at age 50 and they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow," he said.</seg>

<seg id="22">The basd's forecasts for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia 2011/2012 face now "downside risks" because of the threat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Severe warnings by the Pentagon defence on the potential cuts</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defense secretary, Leon Panetta raised the pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic cuts imminent saperaient national security. it has triggered a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon in the battlefields of Afghanistan, through the gatherings of civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon digère already $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts or imminent if Congress can not agree on spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, r-arizona and Lindsey Graham, r-south Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called the kidnapping, would lead to 23% of cuts and the freezing of many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Such a significant reduction, applied and indiscriminately, make the most of our vessels and construction projects inoperable - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously affect other efforts to modernize," wrote Panetta to senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We would also be forced to separate civilian and a number of our staff, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly send civilians to leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes ébranleraient the faith of those who support our soldiers and our preparation endommageraient seriously."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts would be imposed if the combatants, continues Panetta troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Although the contingency funding in TIME OF WAR accounts abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the budgets of basis," warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"contractor staff would be reduced, leading to delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract who support the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"staff managing salaries would be reduced, with late payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would would trigger a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed global leader of military power."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are strongly opposed to this drastic action," said the senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter of Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is not a result that we can live with, and it is certainly not what we should be."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As the letter of Panetta and recent warnings Senators are increasing the pressure for a compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon budget cuts, remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly vociferous about possible cuts, even though he himself has the highest post in the Pentagon budget cumulant years of expertise in Congress and the White House, and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In a press conference last week, Defense Secretary has painted a bleak picture of what may happen - a core with a shell, but not military.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without Marine."</seg>
<seg id="22">"This is a brigade without bullets."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is a fighter, without enough pilots trained."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs who do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," said Panetta during his introductory remarks at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"is a force depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with the potential adversaries."</seg>
<seg id="26">"de facto, invites aggression."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta expressed specifically how to further cuts could generate huge operational risks: deadline for a response to crises and conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Defense and Panetta said that some of the largest projects could move to chop, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">The list included the fighter f35 Joint Strike, a new bomber planned, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new ground combat ship coastline and the new vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the navy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Stop the development and testing of the f35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say it is an essential step to improve and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to spot a lie</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A look at the recent stuff indicates how deceit and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Republican presidential contender Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.</seg>
<seg id="4">Penn State administrators have been accused of betrayal for allegedly covered up reports that a football coach in retirement has sexually assaulted boys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been caught by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lie has destroyed careers and convulsé countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The member of Congress from New York and Internet famous Anthony Weiner went for a fool with a swift denials refuted by the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of financing campaigns linked to the coverage of an extramarital affair.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then, no one who has lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying in his second term on ​ ​ sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Stories of cheating on tests of the school and university are legion.</seg>
<seg id="11">There have been cases where the teachers have given the responses of the tests for pupils in order to see on their performance evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sponsors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How deceit, let us meet?</seg>
<seg id="14">On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, many of these are lies hopes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that foreigners are lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Detect or spot lies is a key competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a game similar to, say, charades society, where the goal is to écrier: "I had you," the detection of serious deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities having conducted a thorough search of such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of the research is that the most ancient myths on lies have been démystifiés.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Liars look you in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do not always bégayent or feeling does raise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.</seg>
<seg id="23">A qualified lie détecteur can discover the truth at the facial structure of the declaration, the micro-expressions, the formation of the issue and the response time.</seg>
<seg id="24">I have spent several years at scientific findings in the vast body and still emerging knowledge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of the modern deception is a matter that is easy to learn and useful to navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Good liars are clever to read others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitive sense sensing how other spot them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know from research that the extravertis lie more than the introvertis, men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "Focusing on the other" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that people married less often lie to their partners than unmarried people - but that the lies they tell tend to be enormous.</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are seen as a mécréant, the rest will feel less guilty of lying to you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How can you tell if someone is lying?</seg>
<seg id="29">First of all, look at the behaviour of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is what is known as' establish data benchmarks. "</seg>
<seg id="31">It helps to provide a benchmark for measuring the subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Look at the position of your subject, laughing, the voice quality.</seg>
<seg id="33">You need to know if someone remue normally his feet continuously in order not unfair accusations when you see move their feet in the middle of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Verbal then want evidence of misleading behaviour and not verbal.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these figures as red flags, not evidence of deception.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Misleading people can tie up the body when they try to remember their history, they can hold their feet to the door, to lean toward an exit, significantly change of position or present a relief "post-interview exaggerated" - a sigh of relief, a change of position when all the difficult questions were adopted.</seg>
<seg id="37">The interrogateurs often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to spark the reaction post-interview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also, heed to the vocabulary of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">The famous Peterson Scott has gone through the past this while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search for the return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Misleading people can also use language outpaced: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky or repeat quite a difficult issue."</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal indicators are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Someone can use a "hangover" in his response to a difficult question: "Well... if I remember goods... to tell the truth to my knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="43">This makes the perceptive response rather than factual and is often a red flag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic bullet to the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognise the deception is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These powers will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimisation by arnaqueurs in their professional and personal life.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of the pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, causing anger among unions while appeasing environmentalists - The company seeking to build the pipeline said it is ready to direct the project to get back on track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline outside the ecologically sensitive areas of Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="5">The official TransCanada, Alex pourbax, says that the company is confident that it will eventually get the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a permit for the project until it receives new federal studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of Nebraska dunes and aquifer ogallala, vast underground water sources.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"It is a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican Nebraska to Fox news.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new environmental review ordered by the State Department would probably have delayed a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the political involvement in the decision.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and the informalité increased foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, auto-appelé of change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, the increase is not, for there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.</seg>
<seg id="4">Low temperatures in February, apart from causing any trillion for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities for growth, state of the economy have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mostly justified by the historic 31,16% decline in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Unemployment in the multifactoriel Sinaloa during the year, according to The Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the measures taken by public policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What we see is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, for people who earn $illegal in a way that is not easy to work for the win, they invest and use them in something," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Migration detained</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government, which faces an economic crisis that has put Italy on the brink of disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti appointed Sunday, could meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a government.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected that it presents a cabinet composed in its majorities by technocrats, even though it is not clear when the new Executive will assume his post.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said he would present to the President the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempts to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"The framework is now well established," ajouta-t-il.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a smaller time that normally, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt at levels not to support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration led by former European Commissioner Mario Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy, which had been affected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">By highlighting the pressure on Monti to market instability it gets to put Italian bond yields Haitian construction to 10 years above the 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu saved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We have said that we very much support this government."</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to sort of this emergency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success of Monti have been greatly encouraged by the support of the FDP Party of Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis has forced to resign last Saturday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said to the press angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the FDP, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its Members were opposed to the Government of majority technocrat Monti form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Monti's new government must have a strong parliamentary support to implement unpopular austerity terms of what probably will be the reforms.</seg>
<seg id="20">Every block or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of Foreign quarters is coupled with the pressure by remarking that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti has begun consultations with political parties, trade unions and groups Monday bosses and juvenile and women's organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">He will end his tour of meetings Tuesday night.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who authorised a rapid transition in response to the crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the cost of Italian debt is now back to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti has said that his Government would continue until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that the terms of politicians will only time to implement the reforms before moving on the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would include politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by experts, an index of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources have indicated that the mutual mistrust and the disagreements between the parties make the test to include political figures.</seg>

<seg id="11">This is the second time in Central and South America and to date has been magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="12">I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is so beautiful and I think that we can spend a few days.</seg>
<seg id="13">So we émotionne to bring our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.</seg>

<seg id="17">They have taken 21 years for us to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry that so many had to spend up to this concert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some are already saying that his concert is the show most of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">It adds a bit of pressure to your visit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the variety show greater than we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the past two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have offered two huge variety show in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in form for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are very keen to produce it.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we love of surfing and the jungle; the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How do you discovered Costa Rica and Its waves to surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have a lot of friends surfeurs and I have a very good friend who lives in tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends would always make The surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, side of Mexico, are great places to surfing; it is as we have learned, through the gents like surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">When the tour, you with offered enormous variety show, with great songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What do you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good repertoire and diverse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never tell the script.</seg>
<seg id="32">What is this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe that this is partly because we have nine records and we can interpret more than 120 different songs and everyone loves songs, That is why it is so difficult to decide What songs interpret each evening.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the script that we no longer have interpreted this for a very long time, help us to stay focused and surprises because it reminds us of the reasons why we aimions these songs and that we can have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">Is that the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour, you célébrez 20 years of course.</seg>
<seg id="37">Looking back, it is difficult to believe everything that you managed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years that it looks like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We continue to tell our blessings and continue to make music together, we émotionne much.</seg>
<seg id="41">We love one and we create worship music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could only get better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">That means to you having been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">This was always an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are friends with the people of Soundgarden, mudhoney and Alice in chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, a Group created a city, but it is much more bizarre when five or ten groups come at the same time in the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the group in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">We play with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year we had a festival with Alice in chains and we have been in Canada with mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden in their tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle its arises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is very strange that a United Group as your continues and with the same people for so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt, Cameron has joined us 13 years ago, and only much more time than many groups had normally.</seg>
<seg id="54">First of all, I believe that we are all fortunate to be alive and, secondly, we are all for the others.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all intimate friends and music through that there are boulevards that give freedom to each to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have confidence in each other with the music of everyone and it can only get better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with the famous word was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you can do what you want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How is a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we have grown, it was easier for us to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of great multitudes of people and people who love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">If we do not forget that the people are there for the music, it helps us to remember that we must respect the music and it has provided, without being put in mind the fact that there is famous and a rock star, which does not really interested in all of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How you remember your other project, mother love bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think we were writing good songs and at the beginning it was awesome.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were a group for almost three years and we have not produced a record before the death of Andy - Andrew woods.</seg>
<seg id="65">There was a lot of frustration that it took so little, and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very, fairweather, friends with Bruce and Greg - Gilmore - which started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture to the incredible person I think Andy has been and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about the music, football and many other things with him.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was an amazing human being and we are lacking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The Las robertas national group will show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production has sent videos with different proposals and this was the group that we liked the most, so we are looking to see what Las robertas can offer direct and it must be very distrayant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why change you always the words of yello Ledbetter live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">It is a matter for ED - Eddie vedder, so I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">It is he who sings and I think it does with the first words he imagine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">As bassiste, what influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">There are so many...</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the first which I remember there Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many influences, that I could talk the whole afternoon on the bassistes that I love.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has managed Pearl Jam keep raising the grunge in spite of the fact that he is no longer in fashion?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think, this reminds me of the groups that I just mentioned, as mudhoney, Soundgarden Nirvana and all those who have created at the same time, and if it is under now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music which is worth listening to and groups such as mudhoney are now the best music than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the beginning, his music was a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">What is this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album seem more light, but there are also songs, as the end and just breathe qualified as songs very obscure, even if they can ring rather positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With the two, when Ed has occurred to me, I cried when I heard and they are deeply obscure songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think that if you grandis and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, is it for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">I also believe that we can also be happy and obscure music even as it can be done.</seg>

<seg id="1">Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects coincide on the possibility of convening beyond the argument about the fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The city contest on the 16 new door opens the debate on the role of collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the Metropolitan déjà-éteinte Corporation of Barcelona, CMB, this administration has printed promotional affichettes collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leaflet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become once again in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that does not move on the north and south, or high - mountain - axis - low - sea.</seg>
<seg id="8">The qualification of collserola as natural park is for the benefit of this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was more central park or Yellowstone with wild in the role of the Yogi Bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the situation until, in September, the Council has convened a méga-compétition composed by 16 contest for all the doors of access to collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door calls the idea of park, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is, or someone wants to put the doors at the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question transpires alone: collserola: park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The contest, both in terms of its organisation as the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation in all the architects of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a recurring theme that two members of the ancient caste elected talk when they themselves in a lift.</seg>
<seg id="16">And this is one of the few opinions on which coincide Barcelona three architects, university professors, which were presented.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel roldán, Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: The competition is timely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to discuss" The Mountain "because the speech in front ildefons CERDA Green, the patés homes has not been brought to end.</seg>
<seg id="19">"should start on the basis that the Barcelona is the largest park beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things for his great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, "which gave the verdict the architect for the title of" gates of collserola "contains a" trap lexicon: we can not think of them as the access to a park, but stable areas where we must act. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, as roldán and Bayona town with experience in the world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some peril."</seg>
<seg id="23">The Perils drift of "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience in the 1980s and who was in the area of the Forum "his songs of swan."</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build itself.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Limit means making something already the next step," that is, its excess.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We must think to new development, planning, because the current instruments... to the Metropolitan general - PGM - can cause real damage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">By taking over the issue, modol opinion that by simplifying the spilling of the El Valles region of collserola "can be heard as a park, Barcelona, no."</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol recalls that there is already a work by the patronage of collserola "must not be lost," Thanks for the opportunity that the mayoralty offers its corporation to intervene in this project, "from the first moment."</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition, it wants the proximity of the mountains to the city is the free ticket that allows architects to enter the debate, but "Doubt" If this emerging technology must send lead the multidisciplinary teams' a success, "he said - that it is creating," We, architects, should be just an instrument. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona hinted that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complicated because of the contest it lacks a comprehensive view of collserola bases: "We called 16 horizontal - he says - in the sense montagne-mer competitions, but it is not a longitudinale reading that path and understands the area as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="31">This is, at least in this case, it has opted to participate in the 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">In a different way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the programme and with the definition of the architect of the door neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, yes, the Council should ensure that the strip immediately more than Ronda Dalt equipment should provide, in all its extension, an area which makes a smooth transition between the city and green.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphaltes modified with polymères to produce a mixture with a better returns, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the signales that the streets were resolved, it is no longer necessary to repair around 200 thousand blackcurrants every season of rain in the metropolitan area of Valle México, warns Rafael Herrera nájera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry - FQ - of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of stone tar is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">During its Technology Conference an opinion on the blackcurrants, held within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for developing asphaltes modified with polymères to produce a combination with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with more mechanical strength, both high and low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera nájera estimated that this type of modified asphaltes could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve returns, and therefore, the training of blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He said that asphalt, the biggest oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, of molecules with a larger molecular weight, known asphaltènes, and with low molecular weight, called malthènes molecules, which together give the street his behaviour viscoélastique feature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The viscoélastique behaviour of asphalt is the fact that high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees C its viscosité is great and 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while very low temperatures, asphalt is dropping, ajouta-t-il.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This means that in the asphalt streets resistance is not uniform and changes during the day, according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researchers of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad México in their majority were covered by a stone flexible, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the layers more superficial is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones baignées asphalt and compactées later.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each of the small stones, which form the signalât-il layer is named by year asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the vehicles are secure efforts, it allows the forces spread very well in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Asphalt if we had changed, they propageraient better, opinât chemical ingénier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the layer of asphalt, he says, there is a final layer called, made in Rolling Stone cover fine, i.e., sand which is also up asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it needs more mechanical strength that the layer of asphalt and provide the grip on the streets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">As part of the street who gets rolling and distributes the efforts, the layer also requires that it has a proper thickness and material it is made should be treated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he says, because they greatly affect the performance of the layer of asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the soil is wet, water is within the layer is it is difficult that it so, which ramollie all sections of the stone and therefore cause of blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">With the formation of a blackcurrants trials, he says, the first rolling spoiled is the film and only later goes the layer of asphalt, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated the first signs with proper maintenance programs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member of the national system of researchers said that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of stone must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its frequent satisfaction, to prevent the formation of blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, the émulsions bitumineuses, which in other countries are already on the market and help repair the blackcurrants easily and without the use of high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">That has failed to Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors which have only Melina Ramírez serna will not gain the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle receives his number 14 of Princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Valle del Cauca was again with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time Melina Ramírez serna has had to be content with the desire to be on the podium on money winners, wear the crown and the gang who accrédite as new princess of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result last night Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico has risen with the Crown and the sceptre, the amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina department is one to a legion of Valle del Cauca women who found themselves near the crown, but have been proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam ospina Benoit, 1947, Clara Domínguez borrero, 1949, Patricia Bellini Ayala, 1979, Lorena Alvarez, 1981, Rose Mary alzate, 1983, Olga Maria arenas, 1987, Leila blanque - 1988 - Mónica Evers - 1989 - María Consuela Pinedo - 1990 - Diana Isabel Romero, in 1993, Giselle Garcés aljure, 2000, Catalina Giraldo 2007, Stephanie Garcés aljure - 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Now the big question on many minds is:</seg>
<seg id="8">What has failed, because the result is the defeat of a big favorite in each presentation has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia because it had not been elected in vain QUEEN OF THE police and best beautiful of vogue, obtained by the Queens taliana Vargas securities or have won the crown of Miss Colombia Natalia Navarro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor considered key to the decision by the jury of the name first princess is the fact that it has not convinced with his answer to the question "what has been the paper was and why? You asked by Martín Murillo Gomez, of the carreta literaria leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">This Valle's candidate's answer to this question:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser, I believe that the final book which was my childhood is' the little prince 'is a deep enough paper.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now I read "Crime and Punishment, this is a book of universal literature that We should read all; and now I read a book by Irene nemirovski, a Russian, a very nice paper called" The passion of the blood. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This response was not very fond first because of the term "culturaliser" and secondly not to explain exactly how each city had marked paper.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result, "The universe and wise, there is what needs to happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for the World, Please read a little bit, "the little prince" is a great book '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Between the assumptions launched there is that Valle was destroyed by nepotism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A Bogota journalist suggested that being the preferred the ovationnée and the candidate who received all the preliminary price - Challenge of gastronomy OSTER craft, the public's vote for the best suit, and Queen Mother, "has awakened the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not excelled on the stage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And it has been noted that in his first presentation in wearing swimming costumes to the beach of Hilton and its two marches on the eve of the coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if the two marches she felt confident, we noted that it did not have the strength and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, Journalist of the programme "Como in Casa" - and at home, the Channel RCN said the fact that Melina had been designated PRINCESS "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the price for the competition does not receive the Queen's crown."</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another possibility is that Valle has failed to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the national beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is for this reason that legally binding two days before the election the international Lucy produced Doughty said that they were seeking a woman committed to social measures in his country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Only the beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, before starting the competitions are already involved in the projects," expliqua-t-elle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">One speculates that Valle was guilty of failings in the backside and fibrosis observed in his abdomen contradictory, but it is precisely because the jury was elected as the candidate natural beauty with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsibly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The initiator of Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco notes that Melina did not have the best body, that it was better, "but the problem of fibrosis on abdomen, which actually for me was not too plain, has left him points on the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine cromos considers that the mistake of Valle's candidate were the surgery she had suffered.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The chirurgies are good, but Valle did not make them.</seg>
<seg id="29">His body has never been its asset and she lost because of this. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For that price, the beauty contest national calls for the first time, after the parade in wearing swimming costumes has created a cruel prediction that was made last night, it was said that it was a gift that raymundo was Melina not to give him a taste for the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of rule, not as sovereign, except as princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in international competitions by national nominating contests.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will in history as a Queens despite his splendid passage by Cartagena, did not reach the Crown.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes Chocó, where a lot of times it had to spend five days in the forest in order to reach the place where were the bodies that were identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and having follows the right way, he has dedicated dactyloscopie Skin, which is the study of friction, i.e. the paumes and their feet.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter to palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew he had to identify two bodies and we suspectait that one of them was the man who headed the guérrilla oldest in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León sáenz - his real name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognised by his physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">He did not have a beard, it was habillé as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much smaller.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="15">Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a préleveur and then eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.</seg>
<seg id="16">The eye has not misled: it was "Alfonso cano."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That same night, the man from Puerto tejada was the responsible has confirmed the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos pinzón that yes, he is the Supreme Leader of the FARC.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For a sijín Cali the recognition that dactyloscopiste President Juan Manuel Santos has made eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against cano, "is very significant."</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of people not know our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The dactyloscopie is an exact science, with no margin for error, which could be crucial in solving crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In addition to identify the bodies, the dactyloscopistes support the investigation for crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of people captured.</seg>
<seg id="23">When caught, many offenders are false identity cards or do not have documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">We take their fingerprints and seek in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we managed to get the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights does," still remember.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">A dactyloscopiste CTI explained that it extracted the fingerprints of things with reactive chemical or physical. "</seg>
<seg id="32">When they occur, it uses a préleveur or a band for the levy.</seg>
<seg id="33">Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the national civil register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," identified the CTI expert.</seg>
<seg id="35">He said that not everything is how it shows in the television programme CSI.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Since March the Japanese economy was paralysed, convalescente even after the devastating earthquake that has become Japanese nuclear crisis, the country's worst disaster since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="4">The government's initial estimates of Tokyo have calculated the material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to be mitigated.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of declines, the gross domestic product data between July and September have served to finally turning the page: GDP has raised a 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Higher than the second quarter - to the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and the since tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the companies have increased their investment by 1.1 percent, compared with a fall of 0.9% capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of rising non-interrompue.</seg>

<seg id="1">The CDU proposes the European president elected by universal suffrage</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union, CDU, Monday 14 November in Leipzig, was without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor, but also President of the Christian Democrat party.</seg>
<seg id="3">The future of Europe was not originally scheduled the program, but has imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government policy too lax on Greek today and perhaps Italian tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4">The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 1001 delegates, there were only nine voted against and 10 abstentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The standing ovation for several minutes that were right, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel, then, a few hours later, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile, left no room for doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idée-maîtresse Chancellor - and the motion - lies in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe is peace but because "Nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For the Chancellor, "The time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="10">This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen control of the European Union on fiscal policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "To give a face to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="11">This is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is unlikely that the 27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the milestone is asked.</seg>
<seg id="14">Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority, the proposal to consider the weight of each country on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the weight of each economy, which obviously meant to strengthen the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Anxious to appease the climate within his party, has increased the references to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has not sought to win its congress on the backs of small European country or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">If the motion on Europe spends a paragraph to the importance of "friendship from Germany," Angela Merkel did not mention France.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except in hollow.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fact that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.</seg>

<seg id="1">As the fraud rulings disease?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the benefits, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the judgments disease.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 - the fight against fraud and the social handouts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And to accompany this offensive, who wish to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on the disease judgments.</seg>
<seg id="5">First to the budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of deprivation for employees in the private work before taking charge of a ruling.</seg>
</p>payments
<p>
<seg id="6">Clearly, without specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill lose four days of wages, so at least 15% of its monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A measure that could arouse anger, but which would yield 280 million euros, according to the Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">And which would be accompanied by another measure, to impose more symbolic significance: the officials a day of deprivation not compensated in arrest of work - they have so far not of weakness, against three days in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these issues are up for discussion, the majority also the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse recovery related to the judgments of work.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Controls will be much more important, and, if you are caught, you rembourserez," warned Xavier Bertrand to him RTL Sunday 13 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the announcement effect seem somewhat disproportionate working with the reality of the fraud rulings.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is indeed the subject since 2002 to continuously monitor and offensive policies, which have often borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Attardons we first on the national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the National Insurance Fund - CNAM - more than 237 million euros daily allowances were issued in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of health, the daily allowances were 5% of health spending in 2008, with 11,3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of this amount, 46% were maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were the rulings disease, or 6.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="18">And therefore 2.5% of health spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have experienced an average of 14.5 days of work, against 17,8 arrest in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average that hides some differences: another investigation, published in 2007 by the monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of French 40,000 employees questioned said disease arrest has not taken any day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time from insurance, says that in 2010, 37% of rulings disease were lasting less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% above.</seg>
</p> 
<p>
<seg id="22">When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are not working more inclined to judgments.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence for health reasons or not, oscillait, in France, between 10% and 11%, 15% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud rulings disease is very little in the black economy.</seg>
<seg id="25">As for fraud, it is only a small scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of the law since 2002 that the systematic controls are on the judgments disease more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the CNAM noted that 13% of 285 000 made for short breaks were "unjustified or too long, 37 050 case.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, 11% of cases were "inadequate or unjustified" on 1.2 million, or 132 million.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In total, 169 000 cases "unjustified," on several million employees had a halt disease.</seg>
<seg id="30">A figure who is very little face, for example, to that of the black economy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Made according to the UMP Member Dominique, author of a report on the issue in June, which represent 9 to 15 billion shortfall in fiscal year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and infinitely more than recent fraud.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In terms of palliative care, the Health Committee calls for governments, institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian Society lives in the denial of death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctors about the conditions under which they want to die and to take measures to that effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked to various areas, including the ethics, law and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">This committee is recommending to the Government to amend the Criminal Code so that the assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is, from a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who described the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of proven death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medicalization or not proven, 77% of Canadians do not have access to the palliative care, report the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68,6% of them end up dying in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths that occur in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said will not change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">According to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are regulated or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation leads to abuses in the application, which is the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on people not competent or consentantes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, said yesterday in teleconferencing Jocelyn downie co-signatory of this report would be of more cases such outbursts in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadians support euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia is not to send the message that the lives of disabled and elderly people is less valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">As people who have practised Assisted Suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be pursued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In terms of maintenance or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was no legally valid is not criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Committee of Experts also called for health professionals are trained to duty to respect a refusal of care at the end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In terms of palliative care, the Health Committee calls for governments, institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In terms of terminal palliative sédation or already widely used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be seen, when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other experts reservations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Pierre Deschamps me, specialist in health law, called "extreme" the position experts signatories of the report, among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia terminal patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask that help it to commit suicide," said Deschamps me, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="31">I Deschamps also stresses that the report's authors appear to have the autonomy of the person above all other values which are part of the social fabric of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In society, "he said, however, there are criteria and constraints."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Health lawyer Margaret Somerville has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "manifesto pro-euthanasie."</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular dispute the data in the report about the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, Netherlands and Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="4">It lets us know if they follow, if they abonnent messages to new accounts, if they have favourite messages, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This new formula of Twitter has been tested on a small percentage of users in August before being broadcast on the network Monday, told AFP the spokesman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Twitter, which was known for its operation little instinctive, with somewhat esoteric terms - RT for rediffuser a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user - which the happiness of the insiders, opens to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of public networks Facebook and Google +.</seg>

<seg id="1">Energy policy:</seg>
<seg id="2">The facts must prevail over dogma</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If there is one issue that you can not treat from considerations of short term or under the emotion, it is the energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and cost of electricity directly influence on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is healthy that an electoral meeting is an opportunity to reflect on these issues and instead there is nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French have to base their opinions on objective facts, rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic changes will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge proportion of the world population of a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, we must address the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity at all times, without forgetting the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, disappeared from the environmental debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is not the case of Belgium, which makes the over to the need to find an alternative source to replace, or Switzerland, which is just not built to last generation plants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">By contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, continue their projects with determination.</seg>
<seg id="14">The US, they decided after Fukushima to add a unit with their central park with the construction of a suspended after the Three Mile Island accident.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the reality upsets the speech.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will result in higher prices for electricity, energy dependence compounded by the increased reliance on imported gas, especially Russia, a leap of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a few months, all these negative effects are already being felt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark is to entertain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Champion of Europe to the wind, he is 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas in the intermittence wind; according to that, CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% respectively and 50% higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">Instead, thanks to the resilience of our energy policy, our neighbours pay higher electricity bills by 40% in the French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">While in a global economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping the industrial plant at home, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, any significant reduction of the nuclear would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which make illusory fine words on reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">That a large majority of French refuse to pay a price, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Remember that our country's energy policy has helped build an industrial sector of 125, 000 jobs directly and 410 000 induced jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Strong exports, it involves a galaxy of specialist on international markets, and makes them very creators of jobs non-relocatable.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, this would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing alarmingly 6 billion annual exports French nuclear equipment and services.</seg>
<seg id="27">What electrician commanderait an EPR designed to operate 60 years as the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?</seg>
<seg id="28">Energy to solve the equation, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity generation, any more than there is evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Development by issuing Areva little solutions of CO2, testifies to the complementarity of nuclear and renewable energy sources.</seg>
<seg id="30">For nuclear energy, maintain the highest level of security is an imperative.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France we have a regulatory authority which has strict control and transparent on the existing plants and flamanville site.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, whose professionalism is acknowledged, are inhabited the same security obsession.</seg>
<seg id="33">In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">One, Three Mile Island, came in normal operating conditions; he remained without human or environmental consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors led to the tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="36">For Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Result of this and cooperation between the French and German security authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR is a concept making it capable of resisting such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While it is regarded by all electricians wanting to build a power plant, the judgment of its construction flamanville would be a wonderful gift given to competitors from Areva and EDF, leaving the way open to grab the key leadership in the development of nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is necessary and legitimate to seek out the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogma and partisan tactics dominate a debate as key to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Immigration policy conducted under Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles -engorgement police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of political figure, compatibility of this with the Statute called "countries of human rights" of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, it is the administrative harassment are subject to foreign students who made the news, the Interior Minister, read the release of 23 May, declaring in passing, that France "does not need foreign talent, builders and restaurant servers."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is rarely seen in economic terms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Is that there is a broad consensus on this subject between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">Has the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 said that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers," and left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can not take all the misery in the world" in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the level of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, the fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.</seg>
<seg id="9">For both sides, they are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is the level of generosity that we daignera grant towards immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In its programme, François Hollande is limited to the mundane, indicating that the development will resolve our migration "problem."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem may be off électoralement; but it is economically very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the recall Ian Goldin economists and Geoffrey Cameron is the latest in a recent book synthétisant knowledge on immigration - exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp., there is a broad consensus among those on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Restricting immigration anemia and night employment growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can replace the national workers, particularly those with few qualifications, putting downward pressure on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in reality, they are much more complementary as national substitutes for employees, who essentially jobs in sectors In shortage of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unskilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which national job training does not supply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the same way as a surgeon will find it hard to work in a country with a shortage of anesthésistes, these complementarities between national and migrants are that the influx of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of national.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni PERI has calculated that an increase of 1% of the migratory flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">And without taking into account the fact that the diversity provided by the Immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth - high proportion of immigrants naturalized American among the Nobel Prize, Google, Intel, paypal eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Migrants are also contributors of social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution - revenue less spending - by an average of 150 euros to public budgets 000 throughout his life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the start of term, to find the missing points of growth "with teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">The teeth, for to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="3">Suspected for a long time, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb - aqmi - and the Nigerian sect boko Haram are confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algeria has now "became certain."</seg>
<seg id="5">"The way the two organisations operating and intelligence reports show that there is cooperation," he said without more accurately.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris seems to be a similar analysis.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have exposed bridges.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of aqmi Antoine de léocour and Vincent delory were killed the next day at the same time that several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">French investigators in the rubble of the speech and Nigerians should find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">An analysis of past calls moving towards several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Radio France Internationale, RFI, two numbers of particular interest to Investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has travelled extensively in MAIDUGURI, a city in Northern Nigeria, the birthplace of boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to aqmi and the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is a step forward, but it will no doubt be more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko Haram."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But it is possible."</seg>
<seg id="15">"known for years that the sect has external financial support and intellectuals, and that it is increasingly active," dampening Kunle Nigerian amuwo, a researcher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In recent months "support" had been increasingly evident in the development and the language of boko Haram now and in his methods, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and even bill than those used by aqmi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, including Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of theorists little interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A swift victory</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 in MAIDUGURI around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, haoussa boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - Advocates of an Islamic law in the Muslim north of Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this poor region, the association has a swift victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is politise and requires a strict adherence to Sharia law and its militants committed the central government fight against the infidels.</seg>
<seg id="23">They aim of all the churches, bars, administrations.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, the militants of boko Haram are particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, unsubtle.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army invests the city, there are 800 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Therefore the sect will be radicalised and leave its northern fiefdoms.</seg>
<seg id="29">At last Christmas, it claims an attack that left 80 people dead in Jos, then another in Abuja.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, it is still in Abuja that boko Haram is qg secure the police during a suicide attack, its first.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations International will be its first target.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which is operating from Mauritania to Somalia in Nigeria now all the experts concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="33">While aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, that the Somalis to al-chebab operate in Kenya, boko Haram appears as a new threat at the heart of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Mr Juppé has warned against boko Haram and said that he was ready to share all information. "</seg>

<seg id="1">The world according to the Republican candidate for the presidency</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On China, Iran, the aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival oversimplification and ignorance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">An America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?</seg>
<seg id="4">To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe.</seg>
<seg id="5">For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other growing loud statements and the shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.</seg>
<seg id="6">On China, Iran, the aid to Israel, the slogans - often not backed - fusent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the Grand old party, has threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and the challenge "for their currency manipulation," a bearer theme in an America exasperated by the migration of swathes of industry to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Too bad if it must involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, Obama ex-ambassadeur in China and only candidate to have a sophisticated understanding of foreign policy, has failed to strangle to an attitude that flatters the emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">He called for a late but constructive dialogue with Beijing - Obama's current position.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman stagnating in the depths of the polls is inaudible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Like Reagan</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If I am elected, I stop Iran, he fanfaronné."</seg>
<seg id="15">"If Obama is reelected, they will have the Bomb."</seg>
<seg id="16">He has also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of defaulting on its obligations to the partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second candidate best placed, has about an embarrassing misunderstanding of the files.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, he called to counter China's military threat, because Beijing is trying to develop a nuclear capability, apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the atom military since 1964.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Texas governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, is ready, in turn, to engage the American army in Mexico against the drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="20">The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a lorry in foreign policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan had simple ideas and that it has won the Cold War.</seg>
<seg id="23">They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give some ground for terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">They rightly stress the failure of its overhasty naive dialogue with Iran on the departure of the "Boys" of Iraq, its procrastination in Libya, collant him and a small label.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But the attack is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obama's people judge rather positive assessment of national security, which has eliminated Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Iraq, it is wary of military intervention that lead to deadlock.</seg>
<seg id="28">And economically, claiming that it must rebuild America to revive its leadership, Obama is more fair.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nord Stream, the new ntrée door of Russian gas to Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Nord Stream pipeline, linking directly to Russia to Western Europe at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with shine.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government were involved, last Tuesday, on the banks of the Baltic sea, between orchestra and buffet end, at the opening of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline linking directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart mark rutte have turned the steering wheel of the valve commander the entry of Russian gas in the ouest-européen network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new, additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas pipeline will come each year in western Europe with a small tube of 1,224 km from the St Petersburg region in the land of mecklemburg-western Pomerania. Who</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube due to be completed late 2012, to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, is the equivalent of the entire French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">Already and it raises the possibility to build a third on the same road.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge yard has something of a victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land route via a third country, Poland and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Suddenly, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to influence Russia threatening to close access to European markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a new German-Soviet Pact, "in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, with his Russian support for this project, has gained greater security of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is the price of a weakening of the Europe of energy, since the project has created a rift between Eastern and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has been in five years ago, direct uphold his vision of an alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries strongly gas consumers, and the fields are in decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new organic arterial route that links us in," said François Fillon in inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are also political and economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the broad smiles worn by the leaders of Gazprom, present in many lubmin gas, to the point of arrival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of the pipeline is also a technical achievement.</seg>
<seg id="22">The steel tube submarine is gainé padding to protect it against the ancres ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is based on the bottom of the sea, to 200 m on average.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, it was not of landmines dating back to World War II.</seg>
<seg id="25">"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution," says Jens Müller Nord Stream, spokesman for the company.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was also more measures to protect the flora and fauna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long snake of heavy metal, as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing interrupted along its entire length: valve or station maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">A platform of control was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project was abandoned when the Swedish officials were not wanting to see a society of Russian state be permanently off their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">"in the event of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of the gas content in the pipeline leak escapes in the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have held soudures about a flight every 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">State surveillance of the pipeline is held by a robot submarine, dragged by a foreign ship, for observation, and a device used in the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the form of a cigar, it is introduced in the tube, wide of a meter in diameter, and it is driven by the gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the end, after three full days of travel at the speed of three metres Second, it accurate information on any distortions in the metal paper.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline was designed for 50 years without having to go through any repair work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The flow of gas is guaranteed by the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 on arrival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have joined forces to make that happen.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leader is Gazprom, which is 51% of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">Have joined the German E.ON and BASF, 15.5% each, and the Dutch gasunie and the French group GDF Suez - 9% each.</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, built and operate the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="43">Renewable Gazprom has also praised the company for 20 years, all of the gas transport capacity.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of the amount of gas really transported," says Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The funding for the construction of the pipeline has been assured by shareholders and 30% to 70% of bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the work hit 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, has risen to 240 million investment.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are safe to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to lubmin, on a sandy coastline set of pins.</seg>
<seg id="50">The valves, 4.5 metres high, form the escape of gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gases that come before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas at every hour.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, it will be in 2012, 6 million and 3 million per hour.</seg>

<seg id="4">The book moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black rectangulaire coverage, elastic, its leaves a broken white colour, as vieillies by time.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the book moleskine as we know it today... was born in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Italian company roughly equivalent, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of notes design but distinguished.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a vigorous public policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Depressing?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No, says Eric Blanchet adapt, the Director General of the Association held the week for the employment of disabled."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The progress made since 15 years are considerable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."</seg>
<seg id="9">"But there is still much to be done."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said that disabled for the unemployed, there are many obstacles before access to employment.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years - 17% on average.</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the BAC and the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, long term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">Short, so singularly criteria that make the return to employment, and that is the crux of the problem, "says Christian grapin, Director General of springboard, an association created in 1992 to help companies to hire workers with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So much for the brakes objectives.</seg>
<seg id="16">Remains the unsaid, changing attitudes, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In April, a survey by the ims-entreprendre Association for the city indicated that the managers surveyed have "a low level of knowledge of disability," with a "over-representation of people in wheelchair, mental disabilities or intellectuals."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment of 6% of disabled workers set... in an act of 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The latest figures known, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We are now around 3%," says Peter White, Executive Director of the AGEFIPH, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">Proof: the number of institutions "taxed," as the amounts paid, fell between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures - and 606 to 480 million euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains white stone."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, especially in the large groups."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 percent of schools from 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, against 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.</seg>
