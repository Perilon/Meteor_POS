<seg id="11">But our way of life isn't unique, the best isn't objectively and wouldn't be probably favourable for the Libyan.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is particularly amazing that the Islamic warriors accepted assistant with gratitude of faithless dogs.</seg>

<seg id="11"> Since the beginning it is more than 12000 pupils of sixth in the third that registered in this plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">One of the decisive factors who cause a dramatic increase among children in overweight, or even obese, is the absence, of a correct feeding and not enough physical exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Only the half of the questioned children points out eating baby for example 5 times a day to have lunch on it case - lunch - to taste dinner, which is the one basic principles of a good feeding", points out one of the results of the inquiry.</seg>

<seg id="14">Without breakfast and meat products in dinner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development are needed some basic details such as a breakfast in family at the same hour.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Czechia, only 23 % of families pupils eat in my same hour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In the most part of families each has breakfast alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the worst who was raised is that a tenth of the population takes breakfast in no way.</seg>
<seg id="19">Breakfast is however the base of a good daily feeding.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The fashion designer must be also a good psychologist, say the professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In an article of presentation relating to the way of teaching for the fashion designers, I a little got angry due to the fact that there was very from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="3">I didn't think of what is later going to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="4">Accounts of three professionals of speciality, clothing of the characters and a seminar on what takes place on the spot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more we approach final examinations and the more wait for us practical exercises and information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even when there are courts Saturdays and Sundays it is really "filled ".</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we have with the head Alenka (in lesson there is no boy) treaty of way d' to dress the woman without measurements standards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And women of this type it is the majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">The one has a small neck, other one boy's body, without particular curve, other one of the overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fashion designer must know how to optiquement ammenuiser broad arms, extend a neck or top up necessary curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We succeeded so in underlining the character nicely and also in not dressing in a too showy way types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and marked hips and a fine size.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If there is a difference for example between size and hips so that skirts or trousers pass in no way, it is worth the effort having of it made made to order.</seg>
<seg id="14">And you won't regret it because the clothing which falls impeccably is invaluable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In a skirt made to order you will much better feel than in the one who slides permanently, winds and isn't fond of the belt and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For those who have a masculine appearance have is possible afford a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of sewed cloths, or still embroideries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are course a lot of examples d 'various appearance and I am happy that I have all week to sort out all received information.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I am also afraid that taken into account what I must make at home there is too much.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Every trainee received a publicity to be dressed for day and party.</seg>
<seg id="20">We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of mode of the personality as well as its appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I will have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know Victoria's Secret of the countryside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the bottom of me, it pleases me, because it is better that to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost hundred kilogrammes recently (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young person Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">We must cut and sew from magazines or search on Internet, print and work the style of drawing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moodboard, as they say for final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relation with graphic creation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">To think also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.</seg>
<seg id="26">The fashion designer doesn't dress physical appearance so only but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on given products tendencies for handbags, topcoats, etc).</seg>
<seg id="27">Mario Kamenik, fashion designer and graphic designer, maintained to us all that.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it, until Sunday</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The fashion designer must have a general vision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Three guests of speciality gave an aspect diversified in the session of Saturday filled with information on different types of characters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Honza Pokorny, fashion designer, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of mode and Well Renc, photographer of mode.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is a phantasm and the fashion designer should be able to use it.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a talented fashion designer can work with the single clothing in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="34">Changeability is for this primordial example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As for example this trench coat which has to to be carried in a classical way with jeans and T-shirt as light topcoat but also he can dress also the bare body, with court shoes and take a photo of it as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or it is enough to take back up handles or collar and to have immediately a new look.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Play with it" he underlined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But I particularly appreciated following advice: "For job you need to know rules perfectly".</seg>
<seg id="39">"You can then begin contravening it", said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally I understand why they try hard to learn these rules, what to make with, towards that, why, while in the magazines of mode something else is sometimes seen.</seg>
<seg id="41">No statement on fashion shows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I know once again, thanks to the photographer of mode Well that the fashion designer must have much more variants of clothing than those who are photographed.</seg>
<seg id="43">That is that for fashion story who will have a dozen pages (therefore a dozen models) I must be ready to "re-sharpen " at least about fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also, clothes and his combination with other elements appear completely differently that in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">We must count with it in the course of a creation of a model.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The fact that picture and style sometimes make the half of the succés was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is enough to look at Madonna who isn't a great singer but her picture and marketing made a worldwide star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In Czechia, the approach towards the use of the services of the fashion designers remains still sensitive to the cold.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the known faces sometimes consider them as useless (I just have to know something but what I parry master key in the second rank).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if somebody has a styling made of our part, we must then count on the fact that he dictates us with a big likelihood a completely different size (smaller) than the one that he has in reality.</seg>
<seg id="51">It remains us then that to sail google and to make sure if information of boulevard mentions publicity in question, if it slimmed or grew etc...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Honza and Mario posed us on Sunday on the heart qu 'the fashion designer doesn't only have to turn in fashion and to be able to put models together.</seg>
<seg id="53">He must communicate with the persons whom he dresses and it is so important to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">Be able to guess people, not pride itself, keep his opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"When one manager asks you to sort it out his cupboard and to fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and say to everything him, My God which horror."</seg>
<seg id="56">"You will find some business which you will think pretty and to him whom you will recommend with what to carry them", says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">This one showed us in concrete terms what contain must everything what is called "Placovka" or bag of the fashion designer.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is the one that you hang around size and that you have on one as all what you need.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Besides things apparently defined as scissors, rolls for depilation or still safety pins, they also find there the thread of nylon (that the fashion designer uses to photograph products as bags, or hats), special pop videos with which one to close clothes in the back, if he is too big (the pin or other type of staple aren't utlisables because they could damage the clothes) or a kit of sewing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">So that we soyions not only people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how ressemeller correctly shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">And in the course of session photo in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get damaged, a fortiori in lextérieur.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And so we stuck and stuck.</seg>
<seg id="63">We didn't have the right to touch scissors not to hurt themselves through inadvertence.</seg>
<seg id="64">Competences are really needed therefore.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.</seg>
<seg id="66">The comptence whom I mention isn't for my girlfriend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a small summary of what we learnt in the course of the second weekend of court</seg>
<seg id="68">I begin more and more understanding that to make a profession of the styling isn't a promenade in a garden of roses, that each says what about it what he wants.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As it is already made in series NFS, result is completely other than what one atttendait.</seg>
<seg id="9">These are potentially games of running of arcades but group pulls downwards because of some useless errors which exist already for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">These aren't really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on behalf of the developers.</seg>

<seg id="19">Finally it isn't the world's end.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the behaviour across the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very nice visually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Tests are besides time at time livened up with an atypical élement.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example in the desert you are in one storm of sand which diminishes you in a sensitive way visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then in mountains you must pay attention an avalanche not to throw you over.</seg>

<seg id="31">What is surprising it is that there are less than instants of this type than for what you wait (to be concrete there is only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">In result it is well as it because this element doesn't risk bothering and is situated, in the context described above, in the elements which liven game up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model of behaviour is in the tradition of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="34">What means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but it isn't possible to say that it is negative.</seg>
<seg id="35">As for realistic simulation you will have to go to see elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But that it is possible to find better in the conccurrence the model of behaviour go, please, with the type of conception of shopping.</seg>
<seg id="37">Therefore everything is ok.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Problems begin appearing after some time.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the diffférence of the model of behaviour, that of collisions isn't still in the point.</seg>
<seg id="40">We don't expect from this game for a complicated distortion and for collisions, but when you have, during a collision with any object, no slightest idea of the way your auto acts, it isn't therefore completely good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the course of gripped overtakings you sometimes feel each other mutually slightly but in another way your auto leaves in mad stunt flying.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or is in crumbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system of upturn it isn't really a problem but it really irritates you.</seg>
<seg id="44">Upturn is made so that when you crashed or you went out in the decor game brings you back at the time of the last point on the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">But you have only only 5 upturns.</seg>
<seg id="46">When you used 5 upturns you must start again game since the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is therefore more a tool, for case where something doesn't take place properly, that quelquechose on whom you can really count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes upturns don't help and it is necessary to find solution in by remémorrant of memory the piece of route in question.</seg>
<seg id="49">The big hitch of this game it is because the same actions meet in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">For example there are some turns that it is necessary to pass some way of one otherwise it doesn't pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In another way you meet on a place given by the "civil" vehicles always in the same shape as you arrived the first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or slow one minute.</seg>
<seg id="52">What makes angry these are situations when you see passing the adversary easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, it is needed you is to put on of side and conturner or to brake.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is equal if you go owing - him because it is "calculated" so that for given situation he always arrives very close to your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The adversaries still have other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="55">During at all times of game, you, you arrive in some places, again without caring about time, and you always have the same adversary who precedes you in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">It irritates most at the end of game when you run on a long bridge in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The adversary must pass at all costs in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="58">When he passes in front of you he hides from you the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter collision a good many of time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">It is possible to understand that the purpose of this game is to do something of captivating and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you get bored fast.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is damage because through a model of simple behaviour game is interesting and places with so much action as you have no time to follow all that takes place.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is equal if it is because of concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of shopping is such as there is no chance to get bored or something else.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The brain child is the change of car in the course of shopping.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must pay attention to gasoline pumps on routes because you can change there of car however mostly the one that you have is enough for you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sports cars are ideal for cities, American powerful cars for the right motorways and the great sports cars in the exotic finery on very technical behaviours for example on roads in lace in mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">And the mode of challenges, which are shopping in particular places that you know adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.</seg>
<seg id="67">You receive not only medals but also points of experience which are added to your profile which is common in challenges and in adventure.</seg>
<seg id="68">When you attained driver's highest level, different objects begin unbarring:</seg>
<seg id="69">This one is connected online with the function Autolog which between others compares your results got with those of other players and give you other functions in the community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the most hard to understand blows is the situation of the last running of adventure.</seg>
<seg id="71">You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the underground (this resembles) where you run in darkness on ways (this resembles).</seg>
<seg id="72">Your indicator of speed points out to you between 150 and 200 km / hour (in priori) and behind you an oar of underground arrives which sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the writing we had a debate during some days to be known if somebody indeed thought during the creation of this game or if the authors really take us for fools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical part of game isn't extra, but the visual part is in general nice and great in certain cases really.</seg>
<seg id="75">What bothers it is that in more extreme situations, imagery doesn't hold level and in certain cases in a tragic way.</seg>
<seg id="76">It concerns accidents especially with a big number of participants when a fluid imagery isn't any more of no use to you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The sound part is good and the track is in the choice.</seg>
<seg id="78">With the intention of pleasing the biggest number and particularly most the young public a new sound track was created in style "I blend everything", but it is possible to expect what nobody will buy game for music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">General impression of Need for Speed: Run is therefore confused really.</seg>
<seg id="80">If game didn't have these stupid errors we could say without fear that it is about the best production of NFS these last years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But this game gives the impression of not being finished.</seg>
<seg id="82">Entertainment is really well but prepare you errors for typing to you in eyes with the force of a reflector of airfield.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Vice-nova, Ambassador near the européeenne Union:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs act as negativists and eurosceptics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The treaty of Lisbon radically abolished balance between institutions"</seg>
<seg id="4">"I didn't expect such a hard war".</seg>
<seg id="5">"It will last 5,6 years before situation calms down and before all players get used to their new role", that's how Miléna Vicenova began its account in the Faculty of Right the Czech ambassador near the European Union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When she succeeded in describing the different organs of the EU and their relations in a so comprehensible and visible way, to the point where a big number of lecturers of the faculty of Right of the University Charles could envy her, she showed to what extent she takes her comprehensible "motto and openly regarding Europe" very seriously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the job of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"From the beginning the critics resounded that he is flavorless, that it is a rond-de-cuir, that he can rempplir no mission and I must say that he took breath away from everybody because he plays his role in perfection".</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, good communicate with them and has a clear vision of direction to be taken of Europe".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">She explained the new post of the High representative for foreign affairs and the politics of defence as part of an answer to question: "Who is who to the European Union? ""To what telephone number must I call?", therefore as a step mattering towards uniqueness and a bigger legibility of the politics of the Union facing states, as is China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (cheese with paste gets pissed which very extremely smells)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Madam Vicenova also mentioned the agenda which lived, and will live in close time the European Council.</seg>
<seg id="13">She qualified the Czech presidency of two years ago of succés.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czech solved going up financial crisis, crisis of the gas or organised a Summit for an Oriental Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">She qualified the fall of the gourvernement as very negative and harmed the picture of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The representation Czech to the EU is very occupied at present.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to madam's words Ambassador, "activity was in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which continues being even resolved now.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is more necessary to approve there the new septimal budget of the Union which becomes very complicated because of current financial status.</seg>
<seg id="19">As it would seem that the budget will be slim and with the aim of savings, which branch will take precedence, which countries will be helped most, least, everything is to solve as part of future negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Madam Ambassador reminded of her slogans with which she arrived at Brussels "For comprehensible Europe".</seg>
<seg id="21">"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons which nobody understands.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or crooked pickles, bananas big differemment either that nobody forbade to us to make syrecky".</seg>
<seg id="23">She better wants to use the environment of the EU and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Europe at several speed waits for us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the Ambassador the Czechs have reputation to be eurosceptics and people who see the things only in their negative aspect more than positively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Error results, according to her, several factors, as for example the bashfulness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support of the Czech part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Besides a Czech presidency in succés she then underlined force and cooperation of the group of Visegrad.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Believe me, when come towards me the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak, this Frenchman says to me: 'Eh, that estce that you make there, that this group of Visegrad still makes? "and he is happy in no way".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">According to Madam Vicenova, in close future it is new hard rules in fiscal policy that wait for countries members.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is the concept of dual Europe, if it isn't at several speed, which predominates rather than a "new European Federation".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have countries in the euro area and others out of the zone."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of reinforced cooperation".</seg>
<seg id="34">Above all it was said that the countries collaborate between them which want it and those who don't want it stay in their corner."</seg>
<seg id="35">"There will be d a lot' institutes of this type and there will be Europe really dual", Madam Vicenova expects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">From this point of view she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to determine bases according to which all topics having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not only memebres of the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1">History of a mark:</seg>
<seg id="2">INNOVATOR IBM begins the second century of his existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If somebody had to search the term which expresses in most near strategy IBM, the closest would be " the long term ".</seg>
<seg id="4">For broad public IBM the symbol of technological revolution is, is a felt business company as very current and however since its creation it passed hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The base of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first leader of the business company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.</seg>
<seg id="6">He left this slogan qu' a big number of worldwide problems can be regulated if people are eager to think.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan "THINKS'! "became the footprint around which is going to develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the magazine commits that IBM began editing in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">It was the base of the culture of the firm soignement worked out by Watson.</seg>
<seg id="9">For us IBM means a long-term thought of uninterrupted movements run to future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived hundred years thanks to the fact that she always remained faithful to the basic stocks and however wasn't afraid to change all the others around her.</seg>
<seg id="11">It allowed us in the course of our first century to transform technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "has délaré for the birthday the current manager of the business company Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A system well prepared</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, in the thirties, started to take care of his employees as Bata in Czech Republic - people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid holiday, an insurance paid by the employer more an uniform of elegant employee and a system worked out well by rewards for the inventors and commmerciaux.</seg>
<seg id="15">Similarly IBM has a sytème of relations with the client well worked out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The society was at the beginning brilliant in talented discovery as one of the first business companies to have abolished any form of discrimination and could so have the choice.</seg>
<seg id="17">Current plan is completely in the spirit of anti-discriminating strategy since it will be a woman Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="18">This one works at the place of IBM for thirty years and occupies currently the post of Sales manager, Marketing and Strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in the course of last years made what they call of the jamy, of the online brain-storming from that come a lot of future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It isn't amazing that he has a lot of ideas - in the business company there is about 500000 persons who work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is the internal and external picture of the firm who assure him a sure position in domains of business.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather of institution than a technological business company", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of economy at the School of economy of Harvard and author of the book on IBM.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM isn't a technlogique business company but a business company which helps to resolve problems of the world of the business by using its technology", added Geogre Colony of the business company of Consulting Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As said the business company itself there is a difference enters to enter on the market and to create this market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or "Big Blue", as her name is familiarly to the United States taken into account its slogan in hundred years it grew to the point of becoming one of the biggest worldwide business companies.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is of course the most polyvalent technological business company - she develops software, hardwares, facilities, accommodation, services of Council at the level of the products of the server up to nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">She has many patents of all American technological business companies and five of her employees received a Nobel prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among its discoveries forms a line for example the cash dispenser, the direct debit card, financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM was this year with 220 thousand million dollars the second biggest technological business company according to the capitalisation of the market (the first one is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Seen ahead of time</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It isn't all innovations and manufacture that had the preference of the client and of epoch - IBM for example didn't achieve bet on a clean operational system BONE / 2, of service online Prodigy or of the computer IBM PCJR:</seg>
<seg id="33">"As soon as your business is built on movement ahead of time you can't émotionellement remain hung on past, "having pointed out Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">For it IBM doesn't have problem to build its bases on many decks and when they don't work she leaves.</seg>
<seg id="35">In difference for example from the conccurent Microsoft which on the base is held and resides under the operational system Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">A perspective technology</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In incomes IBM, services, which are formed for the fifth by software and hardwares, have a preponderant place.</seg>
<seg id="38">However still in 1990 she was with more motié of participation the strongest representative of hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">From year 2000 IBM she sold assets with weak output for 15 thousand million dollars, in the course of cettre period invested 58 thousand million dollars in the purchase of perspective technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">She goes on in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time she surpassed new financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who in the course of big economic crisis also augmented the volume of investments.</seg>
<seg id="42">He apparait from now on that IBM passes current crisis without being worried?</seg>
<seg id="43">The price of action IBM has progessé from 2008 in rocket of 120 pourcent, the net profit of the business company continues growing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The logo of the business company IBM is to change everything but not its stocks.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is possible to expect for it that this flexible giant maitrise of other crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">History d' IBM: From the edges of cheeses up to flights in the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The IBM society (International Business Machines) is born in New York hundred years ago; it had initially the name complicated with Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>

<seg id="57">Watson was for the business company however irreplaceable after 40 years of direction it is his son who occupied the chair of manager, Thomas Watson junior.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="61">The classical PC which determined the standard of computer of epoch with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on walked in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later IBM sells the plant of computers to the Chinese society Lenovo, but bought the society of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began taking care of advice and services with a high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy which succeeds in IBM these three last years - is concept Smarter Planet " a more clever planet ".</seg>
<seg id="64">His objective is the clever uilisation of technology in domains not yet exploited as for example the transport and the management of cities.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How evolved the prices of trips since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 state travel agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agencies in this epoch offered trips especially in the countries of the socialist block, because trips on the West were very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Czech tourists travelled for holiday in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (two in Black Sea) and in Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A big exception for period from 1962 till 1972 when he was authorised to travel in Yugoslavia then regime began having an inclination as the west and trips towards Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The big paradox of socialist epoch was that it nétait not allowed for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechoslovakian) to travel individually even as part of the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">In case the Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or in Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation otherwise individual trip wasn't allowed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Travel agencies in this epoch also gave trips on the West however it was necessary to queue up all night with a sleeping bag or to have "good knowledge" within the travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">And even thereafter it wasn't earned yet.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agreement for the currencies which was condition to travel on the West was refused politically wrong "people" who could travel in no way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovakian currency wasn't however exchangeable and it wasn't possible to get medium financiers without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel on the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Czechs spent their holiday most often in the country where there were as a result many villas and chalets which the Czechs bought and this hard habit up to now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Trips of the Czechs since knew since 1989 a big revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Although until 1989 holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria was at the farthest, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of holiday in the countries of the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The big paradox of which we aren't aware today it is that the most popular country is Croatia where it wasn't possible to go freely until 1989 because left Yugoslavia of epoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The abolition of visas in the nineties of last century in the Western neighbouring countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria in Vienna and in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czechoslovakian couldn't travel for a long time by air on the West that each wanted to see an instant at least.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example in Paris the organisations of trips made sleep the Czechs in tents in parks because our incomes didn't allow us to pay hotel or pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The feature typical of a trip of Czechs was in this epoch to take with one its own food preserved food, sausage, etc to economise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important instant was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed to our tourists finally after dozens years it could freely buy the Western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our living standard as well as the average wage augmented what caused around year 1997 another important instant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to an increasing request for trips travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare turns with links by air charter planes which thanks to contracts awfully reduced costs in comparison with what there was before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the nineties of last century the Czechs had links without visas with practically most countries developed by the separate whole world HAD who later made our trips easier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another instant interesting post revolution in the history of tourism, when was prepared the first air charter plane towards an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="25">For this year as every year of the direct air charter planes take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries every year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another instant interesting for this period which represents our development post revolution came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">November 17th, 2008 HAD abolished visas for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to form a line completely in the group of the developed countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history passed more half of their holiday abroad (50, 3 %) and for the first time still in history spent more than 15 000 crowns per capita on holiday abroad including additional expenses. Crowns per capita.</seg>

<seg id="1">General meeting must find his President but it risks ending by a situation without solution " a stalemate"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 5 month already Czech football is without President and he risks that the successor to Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic isn't even known after even a General meeting which must take place on Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">However it still doesn't exist agreed according to which regulations of vote it is necessary to go about things.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without this agreement it isn't possible to begin voting for one of three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested by the direction of Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hasek gave the resignation in June and in the course of the departure called her colleagues has unite and find a strong personality who will run football in future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only during epoch after Hasek football returned rear towards divergences between the rooms of the Association which can't come to an agreement on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It completely showed itself on September 16th when it was necessary to choose a new president.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of General meeting met unnecessarily in the national Home in Prague because negotiation remained blocked and it wasn't even a matter to deal of the way of electing.</seg>
<seg id="10">He not there not had agreed on the fact of knowledge that has the right to vote in General meeting - only, it seems, for the statuary representatives or also for the civil servants invested with full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this only point there was a partial agreement since this instant with assistant also of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of full power isn't possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">Divergences always go on regarding the regulations for election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is too clear that the executive committee, which in his negotiation planned or extraordinary, brought nothing either in situation</seg>
<seg id="14">Opinions on the possibilit ě of vote changed several times but the neuralgic point always remains the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">Question is: how to go about things for the third turn not to fall in the stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The bone of contention domiciles in following fact: another model is to go about things according to statutes or to find", determined one of three vice-presidents of the Association of football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the rules of the envisaged model earn in the third turn that of candidates which will have received most voice in percentage within the room for which he is candidate.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Moravia is ready according to what is told to leave so that the candidate wins who will have received the biggest percentage of voice of both rooms.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Czech part studies condition that the victor should have two thirds at least of percentages of voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Only it would make lose then the idea of two previous turns and it would make refuse bicameral concept completely", Svoboda accepts who understands the objections of the morave part and according to whom the best would be not to change the regulations and vote according to statutes in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he thinks that the regulations of elections established according to statutes favour Pelta most among all candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Je souhaite que l'on votent le maximum au selon les statuts de l'association".</seg>
<seg id="23">"So that there aren't still absurd ideas imagined by a representative as in the course of General meetings passed", declared the owner of Victoria Plzen who is candidate for the first time and who in his accounts defined himself especially against Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta optimistic rest.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and thinks that the candidates coopèreront in future group and in a constructive way.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible skills today in European championship should tranquilize everybody".</seg>
<seg id="27">"Football will be again on a wave of happiness and it there aure more spirit for a cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec among three with the biggest experience in direction of football so professional as at regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I believe situation in this agreement but unfortunately am very tense".</seg>
<seg id="30">"It isn't a problem between the Czechs and Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change regulations intentionally".</seg>
<seg id="31">"It can cause a blockage again in Put together dress rehearsal".</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope however that healthy reason will win" Rajchl said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">There hasn't a lot of time for a common agreement to all parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say if all direction of football will be complete for match.</seg>
<seg id="35">The flight especially chartered in which had to travel to Podgorice between others the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, didn't take off for technical reasons and one searched a variant to take a part of the executive committee on the ground of retaliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">At the end it is the ministerial meeting, that could take place on Wednesday, that should be decisive.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Minister of the education of youth and of sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive parts torn within the sports association the strongest in the country and to bring them to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">In game there is a lot: a state allocation, the credibility of football and also the General meeting of the Czech Union of Sports which must determine the direction of Czech sports after the financial problems of Sazka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclik leaves in battle for president's post because he sees no correct candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General meeting profile of which would have answered all what he asks for a new Président de l' Association of football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it wouldn't be put in countryside for this high function.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If such candidate exists I support him, I struggle for him and I don't come on election."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in current situation it wasn't possible to find such candidate", declared Paclik to the Czech News agency (CTK).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The motivation of Paclik is to enter competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try just d' to prevent Pelta from achieving at the head of AFRT which in priori would be given favourite for this election.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclik also underlines that in case he would win elections it would hold this president's post only until 2013 year envisaged for a General meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He would see well in function a manager experienced and of high level but who isn't linked with the world of football.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I discussed with people who would have profile", he says.</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me it was terrible when some people said to me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at present."</seg>
<seg id="48">"I would like to make change this picture", he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What, as it is said, bother Paclik especially, it is relation between regional Pelta and the Président de l' Union of football of Plzen Roman Berbr, man in the contreversée reputation who is known in the wings as lobbyst capable of having an influence on the vote of the delegates 'Put together dress rehearsal.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclik it isn't allowable that Pelta occupies this president's position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If he won, the present state would reside and there would be nothing new in football."</seg>
<seg id="52">"And with the help of Berbr, who is a dealer of high flight, it would be even less favourable to football", Paclik proclaimed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What still shocks him it is the fact that the name of Pelta is pronounced to it some years in the course of listenings as part of an inquiry into a corruption scandal there, for who Pelta took out without any trouble.</seg>
<seg id="54">"Je ne sais pas quel le prestige Pelta apporterait au le football."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And how we would be considered with the eyes of UEFA and of FIFA" having said Paclik, who declared some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In case Paclik would triumph in the vote of Thursday, he should prove that he could collaborate with Felta.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September general meeting which had ended by a failure, thinks of the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go".</seg>
<seg id="59">"He has big capacities"</seg>
<seg id="60">"He would be capable of coming for example as leader of representation".</seg>
<seg id="61">"Mais comme le directeur de l'Association il ne serait pas capable."</seg>
<seg id="62">"I don't put the nose in what I don't know", points out Paclik who in September drew close attention when he was pronounced for the cancellation of the Committee of the referees with Ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclik maintains that he would be at level to run the Association.</seg>
<seg id="64">He takes as model as his capacities to run of private business companies and that he also runs for last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with its support in May last its triumph in first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have force to make something change in the world of sports and to bring some culture there".</seg>
<seg id="66">"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups for example with tendency to have an influence on the disciplinary Committee and of call, what what brings to improper situations", added Paclik who chache the antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">He would also envisage a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee from which the power of lobby to politics of high level would allow to get for sports more money of the tax on games.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It is one of the key points of which the new President should take care".</seg>
<seg id="69">"If it is about the tax on games of chance as declare it the political parties, I understand their argumentation but they should also say where goes the money", he declared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paclik doesn't take the current link with the club of Plzen as something negative even if himself maintains that the president de l' AFRT should be "above parties".</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is once again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It isn't ideal".</seg>
<seg id="73">I don't see reason to transmit my actions of the club of Plzen to somebody if I must come back one and a half year afterwards", declared Paclik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised new statutes for AFRT which should put an end to the situations of stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General meeting of the Football association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes which should put an end in future to quarrels regarding the regulations for elections.</seg>
<seg id="76">The civil servant of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday in very optimistic Nymburk and thinks that the succés today of football representation should tranquilize this squabble before vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta before the September election which didn't come true had just promised to dedicate itself to the representatives and to the getting of medium financiers if he is elected.</seg>
<seg id="78">He decided to be candidate at the last minute just before passed General meeting and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend its vision of the direction of football and to introduce it in a broad context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People at all levels play football for a long time and wait that on Thursday there is a President".</seg>
<seg id="80">"They have a feeling that it is the best instant so that somebody takes the direction of the Association", he adds, but he is linked first of all with the club of Jablonec, worked a big number of years in Sparta and in the Executive committee of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="81">it is also for it that he has enough experiments to run Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is persuaded that behind current problems with election an euphoria is which reigned in lépoque of Ivan Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately in l" Put together June dress rehearsal of statutes were approved which weren't perfect as all noticed it".</seg>
<seg id="84">"If there weren't all these interprétattions various we would have already had a President since September", underlines Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It is just the revision of the most important document of the civic association which took all attention of the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I become President, I take him as personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities in case it doesn't walk".</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a principle without which we can't exist", added Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Then he tries hard, as it is said, not to be confronted with his adversaries.</seg>
<seg id="89">He declared previously that he can collaborate with Jindrich Rajchl where he reconnait take into account the training in right and where he knows pertinemment that his adversary-candidate would be his first Vice-president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">He either didn't attack for a long time Tonas Paclik who on the contrary doesn't give up criticising Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">"He evolves in football for one year and has already had some succés."</seg>
<seg id="92">"His attacks weren't however the most honourable and surprised many people in the course of the countryside."</seg>
<seg id="93">"It is also for it that some people have doubts now about his character", declared Pelta at his adversary but residence, he says, faithful to proclamations which he made in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His strongest weapon is according to shining his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level up to the national réprésentation.</seg>
<seg id="95">It should be a vitirne of football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"And I would also try hard to end all business which begins with that of Bohémians or the continuation of the scandal of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="97">"I would enter negotiations immediately with the public sector and private so that we could get enough money for all football", declared to the Czech News agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">He also added that his nomination at the head of football would bring no persons' change.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I should make acquaintance with all employees", he declared to Strahov where reigns comprehensible one nervousness since he not there no direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Although there is catastrophic scénarii envisaged with General meeting, he thinks that the delegates will go to Nymburk for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If there is the single point of dissension on the way of voting in the third turn we will succeed in surpassing it".</seg>
<seg id="102">"Football needs credibility and he will get it only when there will be at the head a new leader", as declares it in an optimistic way Pelta two days before probably decisive day for the career of civil servant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that under the direction AFRT would begin working hard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">"If the current Vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected new Président de l' Association of football of the Czech Republic in l" general meeting of Thursday it wouldn't please big number of people, he parried.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises however that in case he would be elected they will begin working hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants systematic changes and to return the members of the Executive committee is responsible for different domains of football.</seg>
<seg id="107">He also promised to regulate affair Bohémians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money in football and to continue the job begun by the precursor Ivan Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As President I want to take care of football in its entirety".</seg>
<seg id="109">"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the representatives, through professional football and through competitive football for youth."</seg>
<seg id="110">"But I don't say that I will make all that alone" Rajchl in a maintenance for CTK said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a player of team and want to distribute competences within the Executive committee so that each of the members takes care of a determined domain."</seg>
<seg id="112">"Et je distribuerai des les missions difficiles versent que le football font face à grand pas un demi-cadratin avant".</seg>
<seg id="113">"Many people won't be happy because it will be a question of beginning working hard rather than to criticise others" he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">He mentioned, as it is said, that he wouldn't imagine as candidate because of a critical atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="115">"Regarding me, they know that I work 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"but I need to know if it is worth the effort and if I will have people behind me who will continuously put a spoke in the wheel to me and issue doubts on each of my actions", explaining why he hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">"Many people however said to me that I shouldn't abandon because they would also abandon".</seg>
<seg id="118">"Cest a confidence which I can't betray", he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">What motivates him, as it is said, also is to continue the job begun with Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="120">"Since this two last years there was a big de facto job and I don't want to drop it".</seg>
<seg id="121">"There are processes which were thrown which will have consequences over the years and I wouldn't like that somebody stops them.', he declared with fear that in case of the election of Miroslav Pelta situation within the Union returns as she was before Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in a systematic job and it is a thing which Mirek Pelta can't make".</seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind him people are who fairaient of football so that he would be only for those who were chosen".</seg>
<seg id="124">"It is possible to reproach me for some things but surely for no supporter quelq' one".</seg>
<seg id="125">"I try hard to be objective".</seg>
<seg id="126">"I want to play football for all because everybody will be happy with it not only those who were chosen</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">And he confirms again that he would be only a President for Czechia.</seg>
<seg id="128">"And if there is who say the opposite, I am ready to make the maximum for the Moravia".</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is the time to envisage that the second division is divided into two parts the one Czech and the other morave whose victors would meet in first division."</seg>
<seg id="130">"There wouldn't be situation as currently with only three team moraves in division because problem is currently to find young players.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered competition for the post of President, Rajchl can't assess his own chances to win.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I permanently smell a support of the Czech Chamber which elected me its Vice - president and knows that with me there will be succés", declared Rajchl who envisages among the succés futures to economise dozens million crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of contracts with televisions and on law on games.</seg>
<seg id="133">He says on the contrary that the fact that the Association isn't joined is a common error to all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While he says regarding Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second adversary Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to give in football.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Nobody can call into question in Plzen only he did this year a superb job".</seg>
<seg id="136">"If he was elected he would go on surely in what was begun with Hasek and wouldn't make notable change among the persons in Committees."</seg>
<seg id="137">"He wouldn't like to spoil his succés" said Rajchl who has assessed his rivals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The nicest swimming pools of Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A jump in the blue</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">De Julia Stanek</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Paddling pools in optics of UFO, splendid swimming pools of Budapest: Who travels across Europe is possible live its blue miracle - and having turned the city or made a long promenade is possible let rest the legs made tired in baths of soda water.</seg>
<seg id="5">A book shows in which basin of swimming they can experience most ease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder went to research trip during 18 last months, there is an object which shouldn't miss in its luggage: the swimsuit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Spread on the back in the water, she noticed the artistically disposed domes, and swam contrary to marbles Putten who waited for her on the other side of the swimming pool and almost admired Art nouveau meticulously restored these converted swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="8">If a covered swimming pool pleased him, she noted in her book without delay all details worthy of interest on the type of building and on the history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 swimming pools were polled in that way by the historian of architecture Meder and her introduced them in his already published book: "Badefreuden (Joy of the Bath". Covered swimming pools local elections of Münich, historical palaces of bath in the black forest, "concrete buildings Hardcore" in Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">She drove her "trips in the most exceptional baths of the Central Europe" in 13 countries. Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited respectively places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The 46-year-old German is a true fervent of the culture of the bath.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meder, explains that she doesn't have interest for sports but ell a lot feels attracted to the water in a completely different way.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is annoying that the supporters of swimming have to content themselves with considering blue tiles and make the best of the stench of the chloride bleach while joggers sniffs some perfume bewitching forests of spruce or be able to listen to the twitter of cheerful birds of the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I wondered one day why swimming pools must always in fact be so ugly" the Viennese said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I began therefore a collection of nice baths."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The surface of the water reinforces architecture doubly</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">A diving in a swimming pool and volatile oils of sauna - factor of ease in the rooms of swimming are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the master-builders would have given a little more trouble, rooms to be swum could be true one delight for eyes: "Instead of a floor there is a surface of water in the rooms of swimming."</seg>
<seg id="19">"She is on the one hand transparent, but reflects on the other hand however the beauty of the building entirely."</seg>
<seg id="20">All surfaces come optiquement in a double way: high arches, multicoloured tiles, ski jumps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The volume of picture of small format " Badefreuden " made a report worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and of culture on the oasis of historical ease - it indeed gives desire to make a jump in the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her researches in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Next to the baths of ease splendid as the 100-year-old bath Széchenyi in Budapest, it found waters containing some nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (bath of cavern in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths with which basins are filled with water containing some ammonia and (Városi Termálfürd ö in Jászberény) and being in a building in the form of bottle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the contrary, the heated swimming pools open-air from Switzerland and from Austria give spectacular views. While of a roof of the bath of Zürich there is all city in his/her opinion, it is possible to admire snowy Arlberg from an external swimming pool of St Anton: The bath Turkish is provided with a window from which it is possible to notice animation on the ski-track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the conception of the most extraordinary swimming pool waits for the swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an UFO which has just landed on the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">In winter, from the steam rises of three opened sets, while in the background the mountains of l' Ötztal skyward rise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the black forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">the smell of the chloride bleach doesn't emanate from all swimming pools of the collection Meder.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, of l' Á rpád-spa in Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which it is difficult to believe, to be in a spa health.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing some hydrogen of carbon which is almost black and its silt glues you together on the skin as soon as you are allowed to slip into the swimming pool - a special experience of spa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">During its search of nice swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free external swimming pool and open-air of Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bath conceived by the architèque Of š a year Jurkovic in 1902 was meantime closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">By having a quick look by the window of the building-art nouveau in rouge-blanc-jaune, she noticed the development of the bad grasses between tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">She noticed an opposite effect in a delightful swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad.</seg>
<seg id="35">This building has already survived three stages; it is possible to discover not only neo-Roman elements which go out since his conception in 1844 but another room maure in style Alhambra which was added to him in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since its careful modernisation of 1995, the thermal palace remains the favourite bath of the expert in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is already a nice output that of to melt so different styles of building in such a tremendous unit", says Meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">With such palace, the diving in the thermal swimming pool is obviously only a question minor.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The German bank examines speculation in details on material first ones</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Of Christian Teevs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Does the German bank leave its speculation on raw materials?</seg>
<seg id="5">According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann made responsible a working party for searching consequences of speculation for the poor people of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg -</seg>
<seg id="8">For the citizens of the federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84 % Germans find unacceptable that banks speculate about raw materials as corn and wheat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of the questioned persons demand even that the German bank and other institutes of credit abort this avenue of business because it augments problems of the poorest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the result of an inquiry Forsa on order of the organisation of the consumers Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Study leans on a report introduced by Foodwatch in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author Harald Schumann underlines in this article that the speculation of Stock Markets on total raw materials, pushes prices from above and that banks share a complicity in worldwide famine.</seg>
<seg id="13">The countryside of consumers' protection is in a line in concrete terms against the leader of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect the traders against the fluctuations of prices.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the majority of the experts share opinion meantime that the gamblers broke loose from offer and request - and are of benefit at the expense of the very poor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from American rivals: He promised to investiguer reproaches and says, "no affair is worth putting into play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information of ONLINE SPIEGEL an international working party examine currently the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.</seg>
<seg id="18">Examination must be ended before end of year, then the results of the directorate of Deutsche Bank must be introduced - with recommendation, usually.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the leader of the Bank will point consequences out to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="20">He could result from it a reduction of the market of raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann constructs the Picture</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode greeted news, but at the same time confirmed his critics towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the increase in prices of foodstuffs shows in a particularly draconian way, to what extent the today's banks harm general interest."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today particularly under obligation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Deutsche Bank must abolish all investments of the wallet, for which some money was invested on food speculations" Bode declared.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It matters not much, for mister Ackermann, if it is a matter of hungry people or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is in game."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The realisation of Ackermann can seem first glance surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to introduce a perfect picture, some months before leaving the job.</seg>
<seg id="27">Deutsche Bank made announce on Monday that the head of government of Administration will change nothing in what is envisaged within the Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ll could improve the brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.</seg>
<seg id="29">And about possible losses, he has hardly to care about it - his successor will be concerned about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">One of two would cancel investments on raw materials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch s'efforce de maintenir une le fort pression sur le Directeur.</seg>
<seg id="32">Until now more than 30 000 internauts have already participated in the countryside of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bode published opinion poll on Tuesday, with which on November 7th and 8th the Institute Forsa performed questionnaires to 1001 persons.</seg>
<seg id="34">Just eleven for one hundred found it justifies that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on the prices of foodstuff are made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many clients of the bank would also draw personal consequences if they learnt that their bank participates in such operations: one of two would cancel, further to opinion poll, all investments for which some money is injected into speculations on raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="36">43 for one hundred would disadvise such bank in the circle, 49 % answered that they would think about the termination of their count to change d" banking establishment.</seg>

<seg id="1">21th home in Vienna</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Pavilion which moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">From Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for worldwide exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won prices, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty then was in ruin.</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently he is again opened and serves as home of exhibition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If they get enthusiastic about an architecture of modern postwar years, about its clear forms, its glassy sheds, its audacious and lively paces and its new building materials which are typical of belief towards technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the world fair of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Pavilion of Schwanzer received in the past the "Grand prix of Architecture" for its steel and glassy, light and hanging building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is considered until our days to be an important stage in contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">He returned such famous architects, as he also constructed the Pavilion for following Austrian world fair.</seg>
<seg id="10">With her legendary home in four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent building in the form of bowl in Munich, he finally became famous at international level in 1973.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its plan of pavilion as temporary building had been displayed after world fair in the Garden Swiss to the railway station of the south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -</seg>
<seg id="12">But the building was neither physically or technically adapted for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, therefore no good environment.</seg>
<seg id="13">However it was used so for a long time, jusqu "in what contemporary art receives a new building to Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001 the building was empty and more and more became run-down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Currently the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Pavilion, he has the name now of "Home of the 21th century" and will be in future used as museum for contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday evening the museum Belvedere opened, to which the home belongs, the first exhibition - a lucky break from any point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">New departure was completed successfully by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new head in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, promoted a historian of art to a considerable career between other one in the youth of artistic skater, later to Sotheby' s, in the museum Guggenheim and as founder head of the museum of the modern art of Salzbourg, she completed successfully particularly jobs of transformation to the politicians and of the protection of monuments, she got public funds and sponsorship private and established working.</seg>
<seg id="19">Except contemporary art, the writings of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba foundation of which has the same name were displayed there, a coffee and a bookshop are there, and an office must be constructed there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict surveillance, tight budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For realisation Krischanitz the ideal interpreter was therefore.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because he had transformed and enlarged with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and because he had earned competition, but because he had studied to the technical University of Vienna and because for him the pavilion was " an extremely important place " place where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the plan of origin, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness further to its displacement in Vienna and all over its change of use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">During current transformations, there were big problems: l "building was "a chasm in energy", says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The profiles of windows of the glassy facades were changed, of the insulating glass reinforced in glass fibers was put down and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">The girders of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements made place in new working, a panel of light sieved between the home and the road assures lighting, a bridge drives to the entrance - it is almost a new building, but always the light Pavilion Schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">The external doors of origins stayed, the home is painted in a shade protection against the rust of red-brown colour.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema hall is even exactly identical to the fact that it was in the past.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all that under narrow surveillance of the competent authorities for monuments and with a tight budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often materials which are good and not very expensive must be found, and that also please the service of protection monuments", says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw soil in basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In spite of all pressures, problems and transformations, l "building remained flexible and light.</seg>
<seg id="33">It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a history typical of "Drop-in-the-City".</seg>
<seg id="34">Such architecture is "always in the bad place" and wants nonetheless "to awaken good conscience".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">But in that case the Home of the 21th century isn't in the bad place, because if it is about a lucky break of urban building: around the Garden Swiss the "district of the central railway station" very newly envisaged, with offices and flats just stands.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another lucky break is perhaps going to occur: the Home of the 21th century could benefit from the reinforcement of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary arts centre, and as he tells himself, it already negotiates with the city to get a site close to the Garden Swiss.</seg>

<seg id="2">After the affair of the leader Josef Ackermann there is the new in USA: the German " Deutsche Bank " bank must pay a fine s "raising in millions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">As though the problems of Deutsche Bank weren't already sufficient, the past of this giant of the sector catches it in more in USA: the institute of Frankfurt pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euro), to regulate a disagreement because of the bankruptcy of five big co-operative banks during financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is about the sale of documents of mortgage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The regulator of financial markets NCUA carries to the big banks the whole series of accusations, and it to have encourage the co-operative banks to make wrong promises concerning the purchase of financial products; they would have minimised risks.</seg>
<seg id="6">These documents lost a tremendous number of value in the course of financial crisis and drew banks away downwards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We are satisfied, to have been able to find a solution on this subject, without parts starting a procedure in the court", said an interlocutor of Deutsche Bank in New York.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Bank admitted no error in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is valid also for Citigroup, who got involved in a payment of a 20,5 million dollar sum.</seg>

<seg id="1">Le WARREN Buffett augmente de 10 personnes chez IBM</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal sums in the firm TI of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since March, he bought actions for a more than ten thousand million dollar value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Until then the big American investor Warren Buffett explains not to invest continuously in computer firms TI, in view of the fact that l "long-term evolution of societies let appear only bad forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="5">He however read the reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He already had to understand much more early that IBM offers especially services and computer systems for the sectors TI of other firms.</seg>
<seg id="7">An investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be knight's attack in the world of finance.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result activity TI IBM allows itself right to be currently called "Mister IBM".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Because Buffett has revealed in l "economic programme CNBC today, that he has bought actions IBM since March worth 10,7 thousand million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">Its society holding company of investment Berkshire Hathaway so became a major shareholder of IBM with a part of 5,5 for one hundred.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Buffett said that IBM has ever known nothing about this commitment until now.</seg>
<seg id="12">He congratulated the direction, which even during economic crisis had assured the reasonable benefits.</seg>
<seg id="13">"You made a great work", said Buffett strategically.</seg>
<seg id="14">IBM bets since some time on profitable services TI in so much qu" working of the accounting centres.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pioneer of the computer, old of more than 100 years, gives as well Software package and consultation as very competitive adding machines of firm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Buffett had until now avoided rather the firms of technology.</seg>
<seg id="17">He says that he invests only in the firms business of which he includes.</seg>
<seg id="18">But on the contrary Buffett attacks rather the railway frêt, the producers of lubricants or of machines.</seg>
<seg id="19">His Berkshire Hathaway holding company has about 80 subsidiaries as well as parts to the whole series of big groups as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the ex Rück Munich.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">This 81-year-old octogenarian had taken back in the sixties" the small enterprise of textile industry Berkshire Hathaway and established it at the rank of one of the most prestigious worldwide firms, thanks to clever investments.</seg>
<seg id="21">However his lifestyle is modest.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is for it that it is a face worship for many investors of the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="23">Its almost infallible sense to earn some money was worth it the nickname of "oracle d' Omaha".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">After the announcement of the investment of Buffett actions IBM augmented by one for one hundred in the grant.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Big Blue", such as is also called IBM, has a stock exchange value of a more than 220 thousand million dollar total and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious firms of technology in the world.</seg>
<seg id="26">Chez Microsoft, dit Buffett, il ne veut pas y participer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Threat is palpable</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" Turkish media doubts the state of German right.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper speaks even about a "bloody ideology", which would come back to life currently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and of a Greek small enterprise in 2000s in 2006 had an extremist context.</seg>
<seg id="5">Further to this news, Turkey as well as germano-Turkish population reacts with fright and concern.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because for many germano-Turkish the spectre that they thought dead for a long time does again its appearance: since the incendiary assassination attempts of Mölln in November, 1992 and in Solingen in May, 1993, there was no more violence comparable with this extremist context of right against the Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">That there is a xenophobia in Germany, it was however a matter of it never.</seg>
<seg id="8">The extremist network of right which was discerned reveals however proportions the dimension of which is far from being foreseeable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"It is a return to the bloody ideology", "Such was the title of publication on Internet of the Turkish daily " Haberturk ".</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper " Sabah " underlines on the other hand that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of Constitution, and gets worried due to the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of extreme right.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is of a reasoned way that reacted the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration to the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is only two weeks before only the Turkish community of Berlin and politics German and Turkish had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the agreement of germano-Turkish recruitment.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is with joyful colours that co-habitation had been staged, representing a history of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a slap in the face: "the present of Germany for the fiftieth birthday" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform " Haber X ", which refers to the context of the series of murders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also the German publication of "Hürriyet" doesn't hesitate to draw univocal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="16">"this begins stinking", Such is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">He underlines there that people would have been assassinated, would have paid taxes and would have brought by their job a contribution important for the reconstruction of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">The action of the police was received in a very critical way on the germano-Turkish forums and these had later discussed the success of their researches.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Why he already didn't come to mind much more early of German authorities to do researches in some suspicious circles of extreme right, the authors are surprised.</seg>
<seg id="20">More of one proves to be ready at least for one medium rhetorics or even drastic: "If affair continues being dashed off, the migrants will have nothing else than self-defence and weaponry".</seg>
<seg id="21">"this will be well the best self-defence".</seg>
<seg id="22">"The internal peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and on pertinence of the punishment of the whole network", writes "Selen".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What it means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the assassination attempts of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties explained well.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event showed more apparently to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, in what mistrust and distance by acts of violence could result.</seg>
<seg id="26">Assassination attempts however whet feeling of to us in the Turkish community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Never repeat errors of past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the past it is especially the failure of German politics after the assassination attempts about which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegramme of condolences to the Turkish Head of state, was represented to funeral in Cologne by its minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in epoch in its speech, how much taxes produced the local Turkish population.</seg>
<seg id="30">As though the value of a man could be assessed on the sum of its tax burdens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The current report of Turkish media shows one more time how much the mistrust so far Germano-turcs is deep towards l "state of local right from that time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Besides efforts of a more ample elucidation and reappraisal of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, a clear message is this time necessary.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The bank with scandal of the lake of Zürich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The most adventurous Bank of Europe isn't in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">UBS almost went bankrupt in financial crisis and skates meantime from a crisis to the other one.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a German who must run now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It isn't indeed what Axel Weber s "was imagined.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his spectacular departure of the head of Bundesbank; they knew in July, when he would occupy in 2013 an almost so spectacular post: Head of government of Administration of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and profitable career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber was publicly delighted, greeted; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently got solidity and got observations of kind on the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"L'UBS le Turnaround réussi".</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am delighted with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">And however, from September it was clear that everything is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="11">A trader of titles of UBS in London had diverted all systems of security of the Bank and singed about 1,7 thousand million euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The leader of the directorate of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">of the Head of government of administration of UBS is considered since as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber come back finally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">We have already learnt that Weber can be recommended of the bank from February, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will take back the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as announced it the bank on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.</seg>
<seg id="17">He isn't banker, much more professor d "economy and Bank president, and he would indeed have needed a period of adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="18">All at once he takes responsibility then for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again more than it deserved title for a long time of "the biggest bank with scandal of Europe".</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, she was the biggest administrator of assets of the world, and of other one, she skates many years from a scandal to the other one.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, doesn't spare such a proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It began during financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2007 UBS had a very good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture of the Swiss administrator of assets, silent and solid, but also shrewd, her had combined him with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of the banking investment, a very big bank.</seg>
<seg id="24">Therefore UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with 1,6 thousand million dollars more money coming from easy customers than quite other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, she had advanced as bank of investment in the league of the biggest banks of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">It made impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The ancient banker grunt Geiger and later professor of bank during long years in Zurich tells: "I always took UBS as model of good bank in front of my students."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In current optics, they wonder: how would I have simply been able to make a mistake in this point?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He deeply made a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn circle in UBS.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year the president Peter Wuffli left in a surprising way, who was considered until then to be a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some months later they sensed for which reasons he had left.</seg>
<seg id="33">The division of the bank had singed sub-bonus with documents and has to give up hope of thousand millions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To back it up, UBS announced an increase in capital of a 13 thousand million franc sum and gave up hope over.</seg>
<seg id="35">For it she really found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a bottom of non-transparent Asiatic state coming from Singapore and a bottom of Arab state, which had passed under silence, to the point where its name has been even never learnt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It n "was however that the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April, 2008 it was got worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to announce again losses amounting to thousand millions, the head of government of administration Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second directorate best paid by Switzerland, left.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October, 2008 disaster followed: UBS was, considering the errors of investment, in financial crisis before bankruptcy and must be saved by the State.</seg>
<seg id="40">The national bank bought back in UBS the dozens thousand million problematic titles, the Swiss Confederation gave six thousand million francs for convertible obligations in actions, for which she could become co-owner of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">All Switzerland was shaken - because she noted to what extent it can be dramatic for a small country, to shelter such big banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the total of the balance sheet of UBS 2007 s "has raised for more than five times the economic performances of Switzerland (to see graphic).</seg>
<seg id="43">"We couldn't save UBS once again", says the researcher of banks, Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">After the first disaster he was in order of the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">Already some months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax disagreement with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customers, who had defrauded the tax office perhaps with the help of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">Besides, it accepted a 780 million dollar payment - in refund of unjustified benefits coming from these operations with an increased fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">So UBS more or less published that she had helped in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time she lost something that was always its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After scandal Swiss bank confidentiality wasn't any more the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">He was in order of the withdrawal of the leader of the directorate and of the head of government of administration.</seg>
<seg id="51">And of the exodus of the money of the clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So the bank had lost its credibility in some months in both main business sectors: the banking investment because of bad speculations and the management of assets because of the assistant to tax fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And, as there was a little a return to peace, and as it was thought, that UBS would take out, it was in order of this traders' unhappy history of title: the single trader of title singes 1,7 thousand million euro, before the bank realises that something didn't turn circle.</seg>
<seg id="54">And they publish: with the management of risks in bank of investment it doesn't always seem to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With case Adoboli, it was possible to note that the workmanship of risks in too little changing", says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finances in the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also the financial director of a big German bank is sure there: "the problem of UBS is that she has no workmanship of risks in hand."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">However it was exactly about the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had taken for a long time their function, that to become security guard of the big destiny of the world: no surplus big risks, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are it for a particularly noble chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The power station of UBS in Zurich goes still hand in hand with the solid plate of the private Swiss bank - she is only a little bigger.</seg>
<seg id="60">Already situation is classical.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its seat in the central railway station of Zurich, which drives directly the central railway station to the lake of Zurich, which is encircled by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains itself.</seg>
<seg id="62">Buildings are here prestigious, the rents of shops appear among the highest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">The jewellers as Tiffany' s, they are found here between the shops of Swiss traditions just as those of confectionery Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries the Swiss bankers domiciled here: of the national bank by way of the palace of Credit Switzerland up to private elitist banks as Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">They arrive in the entrance hall of UBS by a heavy door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Indoors, walls are dressed in marble, owing thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a big tag for "safe" are.</seg>
<seg id="67">UBS knows what the client searches here: security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank some day moved aside from the market - or betrayed two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank finds.</seg>
<seg id="69">He préfèrerait not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers he is also doing business with two big banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">UBS would have become very too big, be him - especially in the banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxon would besides have spread.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss would have nothing more there to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And even if, they fitted for a long time to the morals of the Anglo-Saxon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon bank of investment which changed UBS, she made high benefits and then breaking up: no European financial establishment lost so much money in the jungle of sub-bonus as big Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">L'évaluation de catastrophe de La devenue apparente le 15 2008 Octobre.</seg>
<seg id="75">"On Wednesday the governmental alliance of the small country to seven million inhabitants undertook the biggest operation of rescue in the history of their nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of UBS".</seg>
<seg id="76">With up to 68 thousand million francs about, that is 45 thousand million euro, the politicians agreed to save from bankruptcy the big bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could it arrive?</seg>
<seg id="78">If they speak with Swiss bankers, they see problem especially in the size of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June, 1998 two three big Swiss banks concluded together a huge group.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and recorded an increase continuously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">What helped, it is that both prédécesseuses banks different from UBS supplemented: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as strong point the management of assets in Zurich and poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalised.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the international banks of investment had favourably access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are linked to the ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 till 2007 Leader of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, in the past head of government of administration.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a team of dream", says the researcher of banks, grunts Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, the big modest intellectual, who agrees there very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who elbowed in up to the summit with the training of the bank."</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel would have trusted jusqu "at the end in Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And wuffli would have probably made at the end a decisive error: "He thought that his models were reality", says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"It is a tragic fall."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragedy, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">A thing is clear: exuberance arrived before fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">The personnel of UBS remembers apparently meetings of the leaders in the course of which the leader of the group Wuffli always pronounced the same word of order: dethrone Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful bank of investment of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="93">She ordered "League Tables" classifications, who researched in this epoch the success of banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">Afterwards all UBS wanted to go up very above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some stages have already succeeded in him.</seg>
<seg id="96">In affair of currencies and of transactions of securities she played a very important role.</seg>
<seg id="97">The advisers of firm, who had the responsibility for it, underlined a weakness however: in international operations of interests, in banking jargon " Fixed Income ", there would be a huge difference in comparison with the biggest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">UBS would have lacunas at the level of the American products of mortgages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill up this lacuna, UBS belongs threw in an adventure, which almost cost him life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Made thirsty by growth, it is as well the bank itself that a bottom of management created before her in investments sub-prevails over Americans who invested.</seg>
<seg id="101">She was transformed into a massive machine which wrapped and got the documents of value based on the American mortgage loans - but that also kept risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Even when other banks tried for a long time to go down.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Still in the course of summer, 2007, while the market of American real estate was blazing, UBS bought there", says Geiger, the banking expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">More euphoria is big more fall is violent.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after other one had to leave, when to put an end to tries proved to be more difficult than they thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Posts to UBS became éjectables and are until now bancaux.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">The one who runs the big bank has a quasi impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="108">He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested models of firm disappeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">The researcher of bank, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the bank of investment, concentration in the management of property, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">But the bank doesn't want to go (yet) so far.</seg>
<seg id="111">But the bank of investment must atrophy vigorously, as much as it is clear jusqu "currently.</seg>
<seg id="112">Next Thursday the leader of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to introduce in the world his future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">51-year-old Italo-suisse was only assumed be in transitional title when the bank parted with astonishment from its precursor Grübel.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meantime, he was obvious: he must lead permanently the business of UBS, announced on Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to bring back the bank of investment to the state of progress of the middle of 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">He cancels 3500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">Mais ça ne suffira pas.</seg>
<seg id="118">UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Whom is she?</seg>
<seg id="120">With what does she want to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are questions qu" Axel Weber indeed already settled.</seg>
<seg id="122">He says publicly until now only that he is going to search a flat with his wife in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The clever crows spread in cities</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In many places, rooks are considered to be "problem of birds °" But the experts maintain that these very clever animals aren't allowed to dispel cities any more for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Some people like them, some others want to get rid of it of them too quickly that possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the inhabitants increase because of dirtiness and of noise of the animals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">An antidote doubles "°problème of birds" am not still within sight.</seg>
<seg id="5">During the ostfriesisch first symposium on the crows, the experts said that it isn't possible any more to dispel the rooks of cities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The experts of all Germany discussed possible solutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They search alternatives in cities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The use of chemicals in agriculture destroys more and more the traditional life spaces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hunt, development and butchery of typical trees of brooding returned difficult life to birds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The crows are under the protection of nature.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are big colonies with more than 600 couples of brooding in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among who Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 2005, a controversial plan had earned negative advertisings because of massacre of the crows in this region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their slaughter with bludgeons particularly violent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Normal expulsion, outsting, is of no use", determined the planning of the city and of the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.</seg>
<seg id="15">The destruction of nests with the aid of the water under pressure or to cut trees, produced often by undesirable consequences, said the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser de Lahr to Bade-Wurtemberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The animals move away, the big colonies become divided and they scatter in other places."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">L "outsting is imaginable only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We think we are made to live with them, we can't exterminate them any more."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Problem isn't allowed to solve in cities without the inclusion of periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conceivable is a combination of the outsting of the animals in an aversif conditioning and of importunate offer, to allow them to re-become established elsewhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens canvassed "panels of information instead of chain saws" to establish completely different relations with: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Jürgens co-founded Ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif of baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing about the life of these very clever rooks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This plan was meantime adopted by the tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Jürgen gave his own opinion about criticism regarding the noise caused by birds: "Here is a big number of communication, these birds have a lot to tell themselves".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Rooks use working instruments not only to arrive at a culinary delight but they fabricate their tools as working instruments themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Éthologistes of the university of Cambridge tested four rooks recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds arrives.</seg>
<seg id="27">In an experience, birds quickly learnt that they had to make collapse a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva so.</seg>
<seg id="28">Without a lot of training, they admitted déterminément that a stone had to have some size and form to make collapse the deck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In a second trial, the astute crows then had to resolve a stockier problem.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a cylinder put vertically, the researchers had put a small bucket with a larva.</seg>
<seg id="31">Birds couldn't attain their booty with their beak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">However, the researchers had put the pieces of iron thread in their disposition.</seg>
<seg id="33">Every four animals formed a hook with the help of which they caught the small bucket of the small conduit.</seg>
<seg id="34">Three of four rooks they succeed even from the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1">L'abattage de masse le personnel</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The new book of Peter Englund gives depth and generosity. Called "The Beauty and the Sorrow: Year Intimate History of the First World War" (beauty and grief: an intimate story of the First World war), it starts with a long list of characters which grips you the heart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">An advice to begin: tear this page carefully and make your mark-page there.</seg>
<seg id="4">You will learn to know these persons in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in the course of these some instants when, as one of his men or women, you will be flustered and despaired in the fog of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a historian and a Swedish journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who issues the Nobel prize of literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">He wrote here an outstanding book which he describes, with accuracy, as "a work of anti-history."</seg>
<seg id="8">He includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; no ambassador and debate on strategies and equipment are found.</seg>
<seg id="9">It isn't so much a book on what there happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could resemble". "Feelings, impressions, experiments and moods are found there."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Beauty and grief" sums up experiments in times of war of 20 men and more or less ordinary women, on both sides of war, young schoolgirls and botanists in escaladeurs, by way of doctors, ambulance drivers and sellers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some some people will become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others of the prisoners of war. Some people will lose members, will become mad or will die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives wobble here as the candles of a church: while some go out, it is relit of new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book of Peter Englund moves away from traditional books of history.</seg>
<seg id="15">He brings a denial in the idea according to which the First World war comes down only by the terrible war of trenches on the Western forehead.</seg>
<seg id="16">" Beauty and grief" described skilfully by other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the oriental forehead, Mésopotamie and oriental Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The present soldiers in this book are under beehives; the one passes Christmas in Égypte under pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This book is moving from the first page.</seg>
<seg id="19">War pervades the lives of these persons such a natural disaster, such a hurricane Katrina who stinks of the cordite.</seg>
<seg id="20">When cannon shots blare in the distance, and that you are a stay-at-home mother, do you stay or do you run away?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who will come in any case?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost nobody can understand what there happened, nor even the reasons of this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts was expanded by assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspirationnistes theories, of dreams, nightmares and rumours."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty and grief" follows by individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English childminder within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the fleet of German open sea.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are mainly drawn of memo, letters and other already published documents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Versions of their lives can be terrible or exciting, but are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small instants and insulated details.</seg>
<seg id="27">Most approach deprivation and capacity to take out.</seg>
<seg id="28">By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, written Peter Englund: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Coffee of replacement, wrong aluminium, rubber simulation, paper gauzes, wooden buttons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He continues on the food of replacement in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">It describes some "meat made by cooked rice crushed in some grease of sheep (and finished with a wrong wooden bone); the tobacco fabricated with dry roots and of the dried skin of potato; soles of wooden shoes."</seg>
<seg id="32">He maintains that "837 allowed meats of substitution are recorded in the production of sausages. Also 511 coffees of substitution are found."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories approach honour and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American admits his own impulse towards savageness and declares regarding war: "You have a feeling that after all, it is for what the men were intended, rather than to sit down in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than to pretend that such varnish is synonymous with civilisation, and that there is no barbarian behind your starched shirt and cloutée.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier accomplishes that he risks extremely dying, and that nobody will point him out or pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">"When they are relinquished to sacrifice themselves, they hope to have a public" he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man choked secretly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations concern the decline of old Europe and new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition" written Peter Englund, "a war between plants."</seg>
<seg id="40">He grabs the arrival of what he calls "a new kind within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of mass well articulated and persuaded idéologiquement, in well sharpened clothes, who carries his butchery out sitting down behind a bar."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People act in an unexpected way; one are found so much basic behaviours as heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Peter Englund speaks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal illness at prostitutes to avoid service in the forehead.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The most ridiculous expression in trade is found of could due to the gonorrhea, which the soldiers buy and s" display over sexual organs in the hope of finishing in the hospital", he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Having most despaired what is applied it on eyes, what is translated by a lifelong blindness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to its task of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens short stages, he grabs the way war "launched exclusively uncontrollable force: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, a dislike for religion."</seg>
<seg id="47">People begin wondering why their leaders wage them a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best works treating the First World war are often indirect, as "Great War and Modern Memory" (First World War and modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or "On the West to nothing new", Erich Maria Remarque, rather than suits.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work of Peter Englund is a not very conventional pantheon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The end of the book is the most oppressive that I read in a work not - fictionnelle.</seg>
<seg id="51">I won't reveal her.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as though he had come into sight from his book, grabbed this page with your hands where appears persons' list and burnt with a match.</seg>

<seg id="1">After a first mistake, a thoroughly planned operation</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of policemen were involved, some carrying helmets antiriot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The night from Monday till Tuesday was chosen because the park Zuccotti would be the emptiest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Operation remained secret of all except some officers high put as well as others informed from the beginning than they are going to undertake exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The captain Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of operation, its presence underlining risks and challenges for the department of Police.</seg>
<seg id="6">There couldn't be repetitions d "episodes these last weeks, as the use of gas adds pepper against demonstrators, who went against the regulations of the department and procreated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Operation aiming at cleaning the park Zuccotti of his demonstrators was displayed after two weeks of planning and training.</seg>
<seg id="8">The policemen s "were prepared by noticing the holding of occupations in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="9">A key exercise was organised on l "island of Randall, with the aim of operation in the park Zuccotti.</seg>
<seg id="10">The policemen receive a better training against riots - to anti-terror measures which consist in moving fast a big number of policemen - to concentrate on the district of Lower Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The last session of training took place on Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan of East River.</seg>
<seg id="12">Orders given to move in the park reached last minute, declared a regular, referring to operation as in a simple financial year ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">" Some policemen whom I know and who were called didn't know that they would go to the park Zuccotti", declared the person under anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The only ones to know that they would go are at the top of the hierarchy of the department of Police there."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The city could keep a lesson, where from the secret of operation.</seg>
<seg id="16">On October 14th of this year, policemen wanted to clean the park but grew back by hundreds of demonstrators informed about plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The operation of Tuesday implicated officers of various units of Police, among which operational force of all district - dozens officers used to the particularly criminal districts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Mr Kelly declared that many persons went and came in the park during day, like migrants. One o'clock was therefore an advantageous timetable.</seg>
<seg id="19">" It was necessary to go about things when the park counted least persons" he asserted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Vehicles of the urgent services equipped with blips and with loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Underpants and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening.</seg>
<seg id="21">Light and recorded messages blaring with loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="22">While the officers in Community business entered the park equipped with their light blue windcheaters, many demonstrators simply gathered their business and left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">No tent was touched before 1 h 45 declared the Police, what left the time to the occupiers to gather their business.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other teams of policemen were seen on perimetre, ready to intervene if arrests proved to be necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Present journalists inside the park were forced to leave.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the head of department of Police, maintained that this measure had been only taken by security.</seg>
<seg id="27">But according to many journalists, the Police would have prevented them from noticing intervention inside the park, roughly kept them by the officers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Browne declared that the present lorries of TV cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were capable of capturing pictures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">While the Police moved westward crossing the thick mess of business of the demonstrators, including luggage, the plastic turf and the bags of leaves filled with clothes, teams of the department of cleaning up followed, cleaning all that the occupiers left behind them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Some demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. Pictures were broadcast on Internet shortly after.</seg>
<seg id="31">The main group of demonstrators set up near the kitchen of the camping, not far from the centre of the park.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some formed a barrier which the Police moved to stop methodically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A dozen persons being in the epicentre of the camping hung on together.</seg>
<seg id="34">Finally, two persons chained themselves to trees, declared Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Urgent services were called to cut padlocks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">No arrest took place in the park before 3 h 30 asserted Mr Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Police, the operation of cleaning ended about one hour and quarter later.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to Mr Browne, about 142 persons were arrested in the park.</seg>
<seg id="39">most for "confusion in public order and rebellion".</seg>
<seg id="40">Joseph J. Esposito, head of department of Police, is the officer most gradé in s "to be found on places.</seg>
<seg id="41">Phil T. Pulaski, the head of department of the detectives, was also present.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Kelly, although gift, "didn't run operations" declared Mr Browne.</seg>

<seg id="1">The labour union of school assistants follows the city for dismissals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The labour union which represents hundreds of school assistants having lost their job last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday for discriminating and useless dismissals. Impact is disproportional on schools welcoming disadvantaged schoolchildren.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Chases are probably the ultimate weapon of the labour union, Council of the 37th Region, to try to make cancel dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, co-ordinators of parents and other employees, part of most worse paid by the city, lost their job on October 7th of this year. The union leaders compared these dismissals with a political revenge not to have let the city achieve a bottom for care of health run by the groups of workers, and which would have allowed to enclose the distance of budget last spring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The local authorities disclaimed this accusation categorically.</seg>
<seg id="6">During an audience of the Town council last month, the chancellor Dennis Mr Walcott declared that dismissals constituted a part of the budget enclosed in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the Council countered, mentioning that the dismissals of school assistants n "were specified not at all in the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The officers of the Council of the 37th Region declared that they would fill an opinion of claim, informing the department of education that it would be followed; a press conference will be organised on Wednesday to announce judicial proceedings officially to the State Supreme Court of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dennis Mr Walcott and the department of l "education of the city will constitute the part defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers laid off, all of black colour or of origin latin-american, as most school helps who lost their job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the legal department of the city, declared that the municipality hasn't been able yet to see the reasons of trial and can't therefore make comments on allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draught of complaints got by New York Times, the labour union would bet on the number of dismissals in the schools of the most disadvantaged districts of the city to support its complaint against an inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose most assistants because of a regular sub-financing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">While no dismissal on Staten Island, and some some barely in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa is counted, 17 school assistants lost their job in the 23rd Region of Brownsville, and 46 in 8th and 9th Regions of the south districts of Bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Noting the loss of five school assistants on eight employees in the state school 36 Harlem, where 68 % schoolchildren live in poverty, chases maintain that "it isn't a district of easy parents who can bring funds to fill budgetary lack up."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The budget of l "state school 36 was reduced by 3,26 % this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional financing for every inscription d" disadvantaged pupil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The labour union also maintains that the managers of high schools could be misled by some terms in a note allowing coordinators' dismissal of the parents.</seg>
<seg id="16">The note used term "overtaking " to describe action, even if "overtaking " describes action more generally to move a teacher of a school towards a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the plan of complaints, "sixty-six co-ordinators of parents were laid off", and "not only because of overtaking".</seg>

<seg id="1">Finished mission: the Congress finds an agreement on the question of Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats find an agreement to Capitoline on the question of uprising in Lybia.</seg>
<seg id="3">A successful uprising, the capture and the death of longstanding dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as American involvement will have been needed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The committee of the foreign relations of the Senate will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by the president John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with the senators JOHN MCCAIN (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their uprising and the American troops for their "courage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution consists in honouring the courage of the Libyans while they begin rebuilding their country" John Kerry declared.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is a bipartisan support of their democratic aspirations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Language is perhaps inoffensive but the debate on Libya was never simple until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, legislators of both parties entered conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aiming at approving or not the military role of the United States in the mission of NATO in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and MCCAIN introduced a resolution aiming at allowing the limited job by American military strengths in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bill was conquered by a bipartisane wide margin and has never made the object of a vote to the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But the same day of the failure of bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aiming at reducing the financing of American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">American mission therefore remained under a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress upset enough to criticise the management of mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the ground from under it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The indecision of the Congress was exceeded by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20th of this year.</seg>
<seg id="15">La mission de La de l'OTAN s'est officiellement terminée le 31 octobre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Senate can currently act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee of foreign relations "congratulates the Libyan people on his extraordinary courage and his determination with the aim of freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their partners of the alliance hired in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Resolution also asserts "the national interest of the United States to reach a transition irreversible and achieved towards democracy in Libya."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Will the new measure win all support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate or will it divide the legislators as last June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The senator and president of the Committee Richard D. (Independent) Lugar opposed to the last version.</seg>
<seg id="21">His spokesperson declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar hadn't read the very last version once again plan yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Within Capitoline, the Chamber must vote this week for an amendment to Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of the Congress, and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measure, supported by the republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or quite other question, to get a vote to work at the Chamber or at the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other legislators until now didn't succeed in making approve their amendments but it isn't without having tried.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The amendment of Goodlatte is part of 68 constitutional amendments to have been introduced to the Congress, on a broad fan of subjects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are recurrent - the same bill offered at the same time to the Chamber and to the Senate - and others are light variations of a precedent.</seg>
<seg id="27">They count 15 versions at least at the Chamber only of amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle which "would control federal expenses".</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of these bills are identical, but give in their support - notably the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to brag to be " the author " of such measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August asked for the vote of the Chamber and of the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators one voted in favour of a not restrictive resolution supporting the idea of such amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which the congressmen can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to raise the border of two mandates for the presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) offered a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and to healthcare, between other subjects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">An amendment forbidding marriage between individuals of the same sex is forever proposed, just as the amendment forbidding the profanation of the flag.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of States are opposed to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As greedy as were the members to give amendments, they aren't also quick as in the past.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 during the 110th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Cadenza decelerates in comparison with the beginning of 1990s, when the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every other year, according to figures given by the library of the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But these amendments didn't have much more success that they have it today.</seg>
<seg id="39">The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but offered to the Congress in 1789.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Slaughtered but not beaten" asserts Gabrielle Giffords during her first meeting televised since fusillade</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ten months after an armed man drew him over point-blank in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in a television programme, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and declared to want first of all to recover rather than to go back to the Congress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">During its appearance in the news "20/20 " on the chain ABC, next to Diana Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled for forming sentences and needed assistant to walk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">L "programme approached its difficult return further to the bullet which fractured the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, by crossing the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Three months ago, she had made a return being surprising to the House of Representatives to vote for the text relating to the ceiling of debt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During her first meeting televised since the January fusillade, which killed six persons and injured man thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified her re-establishment as "difficult".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">After Diana Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "rather well".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Meeting with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of one hour of "20/20 ", broadcast the day before the exit of the new book of the called couple "Gabby: a history of courage and of hope".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">L "special programme redrew the re-establishment of Gabrielle Giffords since the fusillade of January 8th.</seg>
<seg id="10">In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, it is seen on its bed of hospital, the shaven head and a broad scar on the forehead.</seg>
<seg id="11">She succeeds in using one or two fingers only, with encouragement of her husband.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Some months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting down in a wheelchair while the doctors learn to her to carry simple actions out.</seg>
<seg id="13">A sign of the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">A movement of lips.</seg>
<seg id="15">And finally, his first word: "What".</seg>
<seg id="16">Some days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast) (") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the re-establishment of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is seen singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "chorus girls Wanna Have Fun" and of Tom Petty " Free Fallin "?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">During meeting with Diana Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who passes every day two hours with the doctors, declared not to remember of fusillade.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to her husband, he was reading her an article on the fusillade of March 12th when she stopped him and asked for the first time for information on six persons killed during the incident.</seg>
<seg id="20">The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is kept in a prison of the Missouri and vigorously treated by waiting for trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">" There was dead a lot" declared Gabrielle Giffords to Diana Sawyer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hard, hard, hard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">During its re-establishment, declared Mark Kelly to Diana Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Therefore I would say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten", asserted Mark Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="25">You were just slaughtered.</seg>
<seg id="26">And you are going to take out, to recover and to come back even stronger than ever.</seg>

<seg id="1">More pity than respect for troops</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Event: a gala on Wall Street to harvest millions of dollars for the veterans without home of the city of New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Kid Rock sang a ballade on impotence, frustration and loss.</seg>
<seg id="4">Des centaines de soldats, marins, pilotes et les Fusiliers marins autour de lui.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crowd in costume-tie stood up with its feet to cheer him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"The servicemen, men and women, are considered to be heroes", declared David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of fund of the spring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A top - gradé serviceman present at the gala, in which also participated the admiral Mike Mullen, leader d "staff of the armies of the United States, saw the role of troops in a different way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"They were introduced as a kind of orphan", wrote the top - gradé serviceman in an email.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.</seg>
<seg id="10">I know it.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it n "was no respect. Righteous man of pity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations which became established between the servicemen and a public American enthusiast but often distant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Commendations are lavished on troops for their sacrifices.</seg>
<seg id="14">But they have some price, declare some servicemen.</seg>
<seg id="15">The public acts more and more as though he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We are in no way victims" the corporal general Sean B declared. MacFarland, who ran troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="17">" But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us up in the role of unlucky minds."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is about a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, who don't like to seem not thankful or in disagreement with the public whom they serve.</seg>
<seg id="19">They also realise that the anger of revenantes troops of the war of Vietnam was much worse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">So, most dialogues on pity take place in any confidentiality among the veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">After the return of his two sons of battle with the Marines, the reprocessed colonel Mark Cancian informed it that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Some people would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and travelled towards distant lands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Others would wonder yes "an angered and violent veteran hides under the surface" declared Cancian, who fought in Iraq and came back to work on the Government in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">When he searched a job, he declared, he had a feeling that some persons who got him discussions asked in a subtle way if he would be capable of being able to stand under the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return of battle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions", reminds the colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Difficulties of the servicemen come into sight, partly, from American indifference towards wars.</seg>
<seg id="27">Victories are seldom congratulated by such a not very familiar country with the army and which sees not enough direct advantages of wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"As nation, we promote no more heroism in the same way as for World War II" the general reprocessed first lieutenant David Barno, declares who ran troops in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Instead of it, the congratulations of the politicians and of the people concentrate widely on the depth of the suffering of a serviceman.</seg>
<seg id="30">Troops are admitted for the number of endured service periods, the number of lost friends or the expanse of wounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">The army facing increasing pressure to clamp down on the rapists</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a key audience will decide if 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for a supposed inaction concerning rapes.</seg>
<seg id="3">If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the fellow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The soldier of 1st classifies Elizabeth Lyman was 25-year-old and pregnant of 11 weeks the night when she asserts having been raped by a soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">C "was in October, 2008. She came back to her barracks to Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, having had dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague transporting a pack of beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked her if he could join her in his room to have a drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">" C " an alarm signal" was declares Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texan put the concern aside.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: no, he is 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He is from Texas" she says.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I will have had to follow my intuition."</seg>
<seg id="12">Some minutes having entered the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught her from behind, threw her down and violated her, she pretends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other servicemen, some still in service and others not, will wait with anxiety for the decision of justice during a historical trial which will take place in Arlington, in Virginia, and that will decide if a carried trial counters the ancient secretary in defence Robert Gates and its precursor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.</seg>
<seg id="14">These last are accused of not having stopped the general implementation of rapes within the army, going so contrary to the constitutional laws of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, trial implicated 17 complainants at first. This number came to 28 next months - 25 women and 3 men, all pretending to have been violated or to fooled sexually by colleagues soldiers. They also pretend that the army didn't neither investigate, followed nor gave justice adapted after the alleged attacks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Susan Burke declares to be taken to the servicemen trimmed with braid, because problem begins with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The army is a vertical structure" she says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the individuals in position d" to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The lawyer also declares that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, among which most could be part of future judicial proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="20">Her strategy: instead of gathering all complainants in this affair - putting so all its eggs in the same basket - it will begin several trials, if necessary, to support pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of defence, for the Department of Defence, run by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, deposited a motion to reject case.</seg>
<seg id="22">The judicial documents, got by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defence, and principally the fact that the army can't be followed by soldiers in service or not for wounds caused in armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court, called Doctrine Feres, the federal Government isn't responsible for wounds suffered by the personnel on active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged trouble is inherent in the military service of the complainants" documents point out.</seg>
<seg id="25">The department of Defence refused to make any comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the fifties.</seg>
<seg id="27">While the women still have no right, officially, to go to battle, this differentiation is registered only on paper: the frontlines of the recent wars are seldom only masculine.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play a more and more important role, notably to get into contact with the local women.</seg>
<seg id="29">Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers died - two thirds in situation of battle.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's about time for the army to be modernised declares Susan Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She isn't alone to lead this battle: three other trials are under way besides siens.</seg>
<seg id="32">In l "school of right of Yale, the centre of legal services of the veterans prepares an affair against four main military academies to have so-called encourage a misogynous ambience.</seg>
<seg id="33">On the other hand, nonprofitable Vietnam Veterans of America foundation prepares a trial against the army, by concentrating on diagnoses of "disturbances of the personality" allocated to the victims of rapes to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of Service Women' s Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for human rights.</seg>
<seg id="34">Its group sued the Administration of the Veterans in December, by accusing them of discriminating practices in the way to treat requests of advantages for the persons declaring to have been victims of a sexual attack in service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine independent bills some of others were introduced to the Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, 3,158 sexual attacks were recorded according to the centre of intervention and of prevention of sexual attacks (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the department of defence.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is well known that the number of sexual attacks is underestimated. Indeed, according to own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure represents this year about 13,5 % 19,000 happened incidents.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report appeared in March also studies the percentage of judicial proceedings: in 2010, 20 % cases recorded in the army made the object of a trial - the half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The complainants of the affair of Susan Burke describe their attack as the first ones of a series of traumatisms.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the affair of Lyman, she informs the military Police of rape less about an hour later facts.</seg>
<seg id="41">That night, she says, they asked him to tell 11 times in details his rape different policemen, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">She suffered one "rape kit" (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in the arm - was found in its bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April, 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting down in front of a judge, in a trial in the course of which she is questioned on her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of her attack.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six persons manifested as witnesses of morality for the author of crime, who ended up being paid off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember in the daytime when the verdict was returned" Elizabeth Lyman declares.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought that I am going to begin having shrinkages. I started to shout after the court."</seg>
<seg id="47">"I was put in psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember having said to my commander "It wasn't his trial but mine"."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a confusion of the personality, rendering her incapable of service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January, 2010, it was returned under terms less than honourable, preventing him from receiving any advantage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Affair Lyman and other complainants will advance or not, it is a long history, declares John Turley, professor of right to the Faculty of Right of the university of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance".</seg>
<seg id="52">Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.</seg>
<seg id="53">I always criticised doctrine Feres.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is of decades behind coach it has no same advantages and means of dissuasion put down by responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"Chances are heavily against them but it is important that they try", he adds.</seg>
<seg id="56">These things change only when good has the will to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If trial doesn't turn in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will gather her hundred of other complainants for other trials.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We will continue fighting against the army on this question as long as there won't be reform" she asserts.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy announcing his opinions online anti-immigration.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, which admitted having been taken of a bloody madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with its first trial.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Breivik has acts alone, he was far from the being on the cyberspace: it had passed a lot of time preceding the attack on its computer, to discuss with some some of the millions of nationalists who support the groups of extreme right on the sites of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know about it more about these persons.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how to find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Facile... Connectez-vous à Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We realised that he n" this was not so difficult as to find them", declares Jamie Bartlett, main author of a report published recently by the discussion group of DEMOS on numerical Populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Facebook is packed with so much personal information, asserts Jamie Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find the persons that they search with a scientific precision - the way the marketing experts make him many years.</seg>
<seg id="10">L "team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that a half million members is fans of the groups of extreme right in Europe. She targeted them with announcements, but instead of linking them up with a new group or produced, announcements invited the users to answer an inquiry. Asked questions concerned their level of education, their attitudes facing violence and their optimism as for their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">By getting into contact with these persons thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues could question 10,000 supporters of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a new way of making research", declares Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some results are surprising in no way: the online supporters of the groups of right are rather men, young people and against immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But surprisingly, "those who link online and outstanding activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their screen of computer."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">L "study of DEMOS is only an example on the way Facebook became the new inevitable tool in the hands of the scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Discussion groups, researchers in medicine and political scientists use the site to study all subjects which touch questions of health as social tendencies, thanks to "I like", publications on walls and updates of statutes.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users who add three contents on average a day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, augmenting the number of research works the name of the site of which appears in the title of almost 800 % in comparison with five last years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook domiciles due to the fact that he allows you to study persons whom you couldn't approach on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Before, when you tried to perform inquiries into the persons of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You had to go to the party, but they would have never authorised you to enter", declares Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook avoids all that - you have directly access to their information."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could give a means to identify and to treat health and social problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the university of Wisconsin-Madison, and its colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their feats in a state of intoxication had tremendously more chances to be alcoholic than the discreet students on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the advisers, could watch the site and intervene to help possibly a student about whom status would speak too often about alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it", Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and manager of the centre for health, behaviour and development of the children in the Research institute for the children located in Seattle, asserts Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We know how to identify the children with risks, and which would be in other one not admitted cases."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also always achieves the information of his users.</seg>
<seg id="28">L "team of the site which takes care of data studied statistics concerning loving situation and in the daytime of saint Valentin, the turnout rate on elections of mi-mandate of 2010 and indication of national happiness (thanks to only available information - the champions of numerical freedom supported for a long time that the site could make available its treasure of data to other persons for research aims).</seg>
<seg id="29">But the users of Facebook know that the site notices them, that this please them or not - to be possible play the Scrabble with a friend who is in thousands of kilometres, the site is authorised to achieve your information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what's happening when the users of Facebook are part of an inquiry about which they even didn't hear?</seg>
<seg id="31">While the researchers have left luggage offices defined well as for the way to gather information otherwise than by way of the Internet, he is quite other online thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I don't think that a big number of users already thinks of the fact that a researcher could study their profile" Neil Selwyn, sociologist in the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 declares which he led by noticing the walls Facebook of his students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"As much as they know, exchanges were seen only by their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then the question of methodology comes.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even without passing by Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of the truth of a profile or on the wall of an user.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What you say about Facebook and what you make in reality is two completely different things", asserts Neil Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why, in spite of his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notepad and a fountain pen remain the best tools which it is possible to use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with people, "he declares.</seg>
<seg id="40">" Social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social, it isn't in front of a computer."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, the man having allowed to have organised both assassination attempts which made 77 dead in Norway this summer, described as a combatant "of resistance" during his first appearance in the trial which takes place in Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military governor of the Norwegian movement of resistance and the Templars of Norway", he explains in front of a room of audience filled with 500 persons.</seg>
<seg id="4">"As regards the competence of the court, I challenge her, because you hold your mandate of organisations supporting an ideology of hate and because he supports the multiculturalism."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I admit facts but I don't plead guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to let him opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought a speech with him on paper, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of audience.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in detention twelve weeks besides, he forbade to speak to media during four weeks and informed him that authorities would watch from too close distance all visits and correspondence during eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Around thirty parents of survivors and of victims were present at audience.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some people came in the hope of looking at Breivik in eyes, others to be sure than he would be put behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="11">All participated in audience with the intention of seeing the purpose of trial.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I thought he was cold and inhuman" a survivor of Utoya in the Norwegian television channel NRK declared.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I n" not comfortable props, but I personally a bit advanced having seen and heard the suspect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Dressed in a dark costume and in a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional during all trial. He looked at the journalists and at the survivors in eyes by entering and by going out of the court.</seg>
<seg id="15">In spite of strange idea according to who Breivik belongs to a large movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he wasn't mad. He also declared that there is no proof which he has acts with accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">The assassination attempts of July 22nd therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group from radical, what will comfort perhaps some.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it doesn't reduce grief or confusion felt by all nation.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I will have preferred that he resembles a monster, but it isn't case", declared a parent of a victim.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would have been much easier."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons of the interview lost by Steve Jobs, in the cinema this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th of this year, some people compared him with Henry Ford - distinguishing themselves by technical genius and inventor of modern computer science.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what the fans of Apple can find of more revealing in a maintenance of Steve Jobs found recently and that will be broadcast this week in the first one left a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative mind had included processes and working flux of products.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was unquestionably a creator and a dreamer. He became identified with a hippy but was also very careful and was organised, as well as an améliorateur of flowcharts - a man who thought that many leaders of firms suffered of a "illness letting them think that a brilliant idea makes 90 % jobs [but] a considerable quantity of manual job separates a brilliant idea of a product of exception."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely developed television series " Triumph of the Nerds ". This series redraws the birth of the computer, and he sits down during more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this epoch, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He worked already hard on his new computer firm NEXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a baby left maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he declares that the main copies disappeared in the transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the film director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This video, slightly taken back up, is the base of the film of 68 minutes called Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, who will be broadcast in the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For somebody known to detest deepened discussions, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly passionate to display technological philosophies and his commercial strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Et incroyablement attentif.</seg>
<seg id="12">On four different points during meeting, answers come a long instant after questions - between 10 and 15 seconds from reflexion, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts apparently, with the intention of bringing a definite answer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instants are also discovered when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs re-emerges, where it seems impatient to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him jogs to make it speed up and pass to questions or subjects of bigger importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Having filmed before l "epoch of Pixar, of the iPod or of the iPhone, a mysteriously prescient aspect on Lost Interview is found. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers of token or bad to other firms and announces his own vision on the future of computer science.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a thing to read posthumous valuation of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something raw and of inspiring on the man whom we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of size.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision on the way things can be and have to be.</seg>
<seg id="17">He explains it then the following dishes in work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">On the way he learnt to run a firm:</seg>
<seg id="20">" During all these years, I always asked: 'Why do you make things?" and answers are always the same: 'oh, simply because it is necessary to make it. '"</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody knows why, nobody thinks in depth about things in a firm.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is what I discovered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Steve Jobs continues by giving details on his efforts aiming at simplifying accountancy to Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Perplexed as for the way costs were recorded - they often start with a "standard cost" assessed at a rough guess, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant which guaranteed the definite calculation of the commercial costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On opportunity to play a turn the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" which he created with Steve Wozniak - an apparatus which served for pirating telephone networks and for phoning free in long - distance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The apparatus made the object of many writings in anticipation, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in its description of the Blue Box as an act of taking over is infectious.</seg>
<seg id="28">He describes the way he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, by making a call then connected from a network AT*JYT0KT to other one while by-passing so many satellites as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We enveloped the bowl of different things a half a dozen of time and you howled in the pay phone and this arrived at you one minute later to the pay phone of in side, "explain Jobs by laughing.</seg>
<seg id="30">" We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learnt that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling thousand millions of dollars of facilities worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="31">We didn't know thing big both, but we could invent a small thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that Apple would have a day existed without it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Steve Jobs continues by telling a marvellous turn which he and Wozniak perfected: he phoned to Vatican City with the Blue Box right in the middle of the night by passing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="33">While several members of Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, both accomplices leave in mad laugh just before the Pope is awakened himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On his love with technology (and door-to-door selling of Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">In l "age of 12 years, in the hunt for spare parts to fabricate a fréquencemètre, he searches the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and phones to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after their dialogue of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a job of part-time summer to Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It had one remarkable influence on me. C" the only firm was that I had seen in this age and it formed my definition of a firm and the way the employees are treated."</seg>
<seg id="38">Steve Jobs later became one of the employees HP to visit the research laboratories of the firm, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the first "computer of never conceived office."</seg>
<seg id="39">It was also big that a suitcase, had small one cathode-ray tube. I fell in love with it.</seg>
<seg id="40">The teenager that j "props went back at the place of HP and began writing programmes for this machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On the improvisation of innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">At several instants in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on impulse.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the beginning of his career, while he becomes established to sell some cards of printed circuits, a client asks him to put together a complete computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working in only 30 days of credit, he should take care of assemblage as well as delivery of the finished apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, to Apple, he remembers difficulties met to develop a mouse of computer:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember big disputes they shouted me over by pretending that I would need five years [to fabricate a mouse who would cost 300 $]. I had it enough, I went out and to see a concepteur."</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse whom we could fabricate for 15 $ and who proved to be terrifically reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On the big firms which get breathless:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before that he makes relive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders are going to make a mistake and lost the control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Let's suppose that you worked at the place of IBM or Xerox, you make a better photocopier or a better printer, and afterwards?"</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the firm more doesn't meet with success.</seg>
<seg id="52">Sales and marketing can bring some change in her, therefore [these are these types of persons] who end up running firms and personnel specialised in product are put in l "distance of the catches of decisions.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius there produces who drove to this position of monopoly is completely rotted by the persons who can't imagine to conceive a good product in comparison with a bad product - requested manual job.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is what occurred at the place of Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox would have been able to keep all computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">She would have been able to make ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the nineties...</seg>
<seg id="57">They tore defeat off from victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On innovation as artistic form:</seg>
<seg id="59">"A huge part of manual job separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."</seg>
<seg id="60">You teach tremendously on his subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are compromises to be made... Some things which you can't make, electrons can him, the glass, robots, plants also.</seg>
<seg id="62">You must keep thousands of things in the mind (these concepts) by putting them together them some in others.</seg>
<seg id="63">Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is a question of trying to display to you in the best products which the men created, and to try to bring these things in the product which you create.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said a day which the good artists copy and which the big artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">We are always ashamed to steal very good ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is partly what returns exceptional Macintosh. The persons who worked over were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">If it isn't for computer science, they would have made the extraordinary things in another domain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomases have dinner with adversaries of the right of health while the court meets</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">When the Supreme Court meets in camera to examine the question of political dissension, to know if the opposition to the law of the president Obama of health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were pointed out during a dinner backed by the law firm which will defend affair in front of the High Court of Justice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Event was last Thursday, when nine judges met for a conference aiming at discussing petitions for examination.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the business in question concerned a trial begun by 26 States questioning the ambitious reform of healthcare voted by the Congress the last year, a law which was a point of rallying for the conservative activists on a national scale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed to hear complaint, indeed, waits one next March for a monumental argument of 5 h 30, and result will be probably likely to favour the destabilization of the presidential running of 2012, which will be booming at the time when the decision of the court will be pronounced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will be held before the court and argue about the rejection of law, will be probably Paul Clement, who served as general supplicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was part of both dozens of offices which helped to back the annual dinner of the Society Federalist (Federalist Society), a longstanding group devoted to defend conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another office which backed the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations which questioned law, national Federation of the independent firms (National Federation of Independent Business).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who introduces a huge financial stake in the result of litigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dinner was held to a hotel Washington some hours after the conference of the court on affair.</seg>
<seg id="11">MITCH MCCONNELL, republican beep of the Senate and adversary declared of the law of health was, between others there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests star in dinner? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It isn't new: both judges were present at events of the Society Federalist during years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is nothing that goes contrary to the rules of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the judges are exempted from code of behaviour which governs the actions of the federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they were he, they would argue undoubtedly by the code of Cannon 4C, which stipulates: "A judge can attend collections of fund of organisations linked to right and others well than the judge couldn't be a dealer, a guest of honour, or appearing on the programme of such event".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the law firms of affair, as well as to a firm having a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of the governmental ethics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This violation of the ethics and superb indifference regarding code contradicts statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges", declared Bob Edgar, president of Common Reason.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges drank and had dinner and in a collection of fund of gala with lawyers with cases in authority before the court".</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and their participation in the collection of fund of this event disassembles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomases showed not enough respect for critics maintaining that they blend too easily the business of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist society.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative activist of top - profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Moreover, the conservatives pretend that it is the judge Elena Kagan with a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was general supplicant of the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to law were carried at the level of the higher level court.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her critics lobbied so that Kagan challenges to hear case, saying that she had too much put itself into the defence of law to be uncommitted.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan gave no indication that it would make it.</seg>

<seg id="3">Boeing sells also six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market was estimated at more than a thousand million dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">There is nothing extraordinary in it than a company receives an order considering 50 of its products.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is on the other hand the whole affair when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and what taking him up of these 50 planes attained the record sum 18 thousand million dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Also incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders of planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">In predictions published on Monday, the company of Chicago thinks that the airlines of the Middle East will need in 20 next years of 2 520 planes of a complete 450 thousand million dollar value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In the course of the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive order of commercial airliners of the history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai which placed this Pharaonic order.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boeing announced in the Aicraft Living room of Dubai of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 planes besides, what would raise the sum of order in 26 thousand million dollars.</seg>

<seg id="12">The sum of these six apparatus s "pupil in more than a thousand million dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"It is apparently very positive for Boeing, "declared Neal Dihora, analyst of Morningstar.</seg>
<seg id="14">"These clients especially have a huge value."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the Middle East, the oil-producing countries have many their airlines.</seg>
<seg id="16">They have therefore not only the means to pay these planes, but the rise of the price of the fuel - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their the most important expenses - wouldn't be so harmful to them since the country would make money with the rise of the price of oil.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is an important point because these companies will be less touchy than others to cancel or to postpone their orders of planes when the price of oil augments, signalled Dihora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"They have a natural cover of risk", he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The order of Emirates reinforces the predominance of Boeing on the market of planes jumbo aircrafts and helps to slow down the try of encroachment of the rival Airbus with its plane A350.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The victory of Boeing in the living room of aeronautics arrives four months afterwards the announcement of Airbus to put back the beginning of the biggest version of A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The sister of the president Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her try of access to functions of governor of Michoacán in the course of violent elections, and she declared on Monday that the drugs dealers favoured one of his adversaries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The first results pointed out that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of running in governor's post of this Western State.</seg>
</p>	
<p>
<seg id="5">"The intervention of organised crime during all process of vote and especially yesterday is a frightening fact, not only for Michoacán but also for country entirely", signalled Luisa Maria Calderon to the radio in the course of an interview on Mondays according to elections.</seg>
<seg id="6">"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They took over ballot boxes, installed road dams and made people vote" for PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">PRI governed Mexico during seventy years jusqu "to lose the presidency in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he organises his return, and a victory in Michoacán is a step mattering in this effort.</seg>

<seg id="1">BASD deeply encourages the Asia to help the euro area</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Asiatic Bank of Development asked in India and in China to get ready to help the euro area to go out of the crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long-term reduction which would prevent development of l "Asiatic economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Rajat Nag, the managing director of the BASD based in Manila, declared that both economic powers in the quickest growth of the world had to "make all that is in their power" to speed up the recovery of the monetary zone by means of the International Monetary Bottom or direct bilateral agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">He disadvised to BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at difficulties of Europe of a "uninterested eye" and signalled that an Asiatic financial support beside the leaders and the resources of Europe would allow d "to avoid a long-term collapse of l" worldwide economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are all together in this crisis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"As a result whoever can help Europe to go out of crisis am useful", he said to Financial Times in the course of an interview during the worldwide Economic Forum in Bombay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Asia can be protected jusqu" in some point but she isn't in the shelter."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Therefore if China and India can help, that nothing prevents them from it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">These last months, the euro area was seriously shaken by a crisis of sovereign debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, the cost of the Italian loan dangerously zoomed and the First ministers of Italy and of Greece resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The flourishing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe made flow the fright which l "worldwide economy takes in in recession, and provoked the call of the main emergent savings to meet to help the euro area to find a solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would route any Asiatic help, but he also declared that this bilateral assistance - as to buy the obligations of the fund of financial rescue of the United States, the European Fund of financial stability - gave a bigger power of negotiations to the Asiatic partners of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade and Industry Indian, pointed out that "India will make all what she will be able" to help the euro area given that its own economy suffers now from a fall of export and from a drying up of the arrivals of foreign capitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Nobody wants that the euro area remains unstable and agitated", he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We have monumental challenges to be raised and we must support a high level of growth."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It isn't a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find job for the dozens millions of our young men and women?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Others support that savings in development such as India shouldn't help the European rich men while they face up their own important economic challenges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ashutosh Varshney, professor to the university Brown in the United States, declared that it would be politically very difficult to make accept a help to Europe in 1,2 thousand millions of Indian, among which at least 800 000 live with 2 dollars a day, or even less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"Once they will discover that the Greeks retire in 50 years and that they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow it", he signalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Lee Howell, the president of the worldwide economic Forum, also wondered why the reservations of India should be used to support of many Greek civil servants paid well in jobs badly managed which generate losses, as in the railway sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Mr Nag declared that the crisis of the euro area risked causing significant repercussions " across the Asia.</seg>
<seg id="22">The predictions of BASD of a 7,5 % economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 confront now "risks of loss" because of European threat.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Strict warnings of the Pentagon on the potential reductions of defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Secretary in Defence, Leon Panetta, made take pressure up on the Congress on Monday, informing that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He launched a financial chain reaction of the corridors of the Pentagon in the battlefields of Afghanistan, by way of civilians' gathering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon digest already 450 thousand million dollars of reductions for next decade, but feared now that an additional 600-dollar sum or more compression is imminent if the Congress doesn't reach an agreement on expenses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impacts of these reductions would be destructive for the ministry", declared Panetta in a letter to the senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He declared that the failure of the Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in what is called sequestration, would draw away 23 % reductions as well as the frost of many new plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Such an important reduction, applied so without judiciousness, would return most our ships and our impracticable plans of building - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or of a building - and undermine gravely other efforts of modernisation", writes Panetta to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We would be also forced to part from some our civil personnel and, because the reduction would be so fast imposed, we should almost indeed send civilians in leave without wage with a view to reaching target."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our servicemen and would harm our preparation seriously."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Reductions would touch possibly the combat troops, Panetta goes on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Although the financing in times of war of the count of the operations of eventuality abroad isn't directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in basic budgets", informed Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The contracting personnel would would been reduced, rousing of delays in contracts and supervision of the contract which support war".</seg>
<seg id="12">"Personnel managing wages would would been reduced, rousing of delays of payment to the war suppliers, and legal and political support would be unsettled".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compression on the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequence of a sequestration to the department of Defence would have would launch a quick decline of the United States as outright worldwide leader of military power".</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action", declared the senators in a common statement on Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter of Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It isn't a consequence with which we can live, and it isn't indeed the one that we should impose ourselves".</seg>
<seg id="17">"Sequestration is a threat for the interests of national security of the United States, and it shouldn't occur".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators augment pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon of reductions, remain to see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta was more and more virulent about possible compression, even if he reached the highest post of the Pentagon himself combining years of expertise of the budget to the Congress and the White House and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference last week, secretary in Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a serviceman with a shell, but no core.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors".</seg>
<seg id="22">"C'est une la brigade sans balles".</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is a fighter, without enough formed pilots".</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, of buildings and of bombs without enough formed soldiers capable of fulfilling mission", declared Panetta during the preliminary comments in the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a force depressed, badly prepared and unable to face up potential adversaries".</seg>
<seg id="26">"De facto, she invites to attack.."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an addendum in the letters in MCCAIN and Graham, Panetta enunciated specifically how new reductions could "generate important operational risks: delay of answer to crises, conflicts and disasters; strict borders in our capacity to display and to hire us in the world; and unacceptable taken risk in operations of future battle".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta declared that some of the biggest plans of defence would be possible pass to the cleaver, including those already tested and some just at the first stadiums of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new envisaged bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new ship of coastal battle and the new vehicle of ground, which would replace Humvee of army and of navy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">To put an end to development and to trials of F35 could generate 80 thousand million dollars of savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that it is an essential stage of improvement and of answer to the potential threats of China and of other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to spot a lie</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A look on the recent cuffs points out to what extent deceit and lie are omnipresent in daily life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is occupied to exchange allegations of sexual harassment with several women; every side accusing other one of lying.</seg>
<seg id="4">The administrators of Penn State were accused of perjurer to have supposedly covered reports according to which a football coach in retirement attacked boys sexually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by one microphone opened maintaining to the American president Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The congressman of New York and publicity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, was taken for an idiot by issuing fast denials contradicted by irrefutable proof.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ancient candidate for presidential election John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of countryside linked to the cover of an extramarital link.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then, none of the one who lived history will never forget the media circus which the president Bill Clinton launched by lying during his second term on ​​ his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The stories of cheating in the tests of the school and of the university are legion.</seg>
<seg id="11">There were cases where the teachers gave the answers of tests to the pupils to be well seen on their valuation of performance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The mentors who should teach the opposite send the message according to who lie and the cheating is allowable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much deceit do we meet?</seg>
<seg id="14">On given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, a lot of these are pious lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that the foreigners fool themselves three times in first 10 minutes of their meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">To discern or to spot lies is an essential competence which each must acquire, at the same time for personal and professional reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a similar parlour game in, let's say, charades, where objective is to exclaim: "I had you", the detection of deceit is a serious branch of knowledge founded on scientific data gathered in the course of six last decades in prestigious universities having performed a research in depth of such plans, notably in psychology and in physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the results of research is that the most ancient myths on lie were demystified.</seg>
<seg id="20">The liars look at you in eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">They stutter, go red or don't always fidget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Don't conclude from it that the liars are difficult to discern and difficult to unmask.</seg>
<seg id="23">A skilled lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of statement, facial micro-expressions, training of question and response time.</seg>
<seg id="24">I passed several years to examine scientific results in the large body and always emergent of knowledge on deceit, and it is clear that the detection of deceit is a modern competence which is easy to teach and useful to sail in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities notably include appointment, meetings, negotiation or management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liars are clever at reading others well, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and intuitively discerning how others receive them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know according to researches that extravertis lies more than the introverts, that the men to say lies more "centered on them" while the women say more lies "centered on others" - habitually to protect the feelings of somebody - than the married persons lie less often to their partners than the not married persons (but that the lies which they tell have tendency to be huge).</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are received as a mécréant, others are going to feel less guilty to lie to you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How can you say if somebody lies?</seg>
<seg id="29">First of all, notice the normal behaviour of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is what they call "to establish data landmarks".</seg>
<seg id="31">It helps to give a point of reference to measure subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Notice the position of your subject, laugh, vocal quality.</seg>
<seg id="33">You must know if somebody moves his feet normally permanently not to level unfair accusations when you see him moving feet in the middle of meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then search indications of not verbal and verbal misleading behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these indications to be red flags, no proof of deceit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Misleading people can immobilise the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can check their feet off towards the door, lean towards an exit, change position significantly or introduce a relief of "post interview" - a sigh exaggerated by relief, a change of position when all difficult questions passed.</seg>
<seg id="37">The interviewers point out often erroneously that maintenance is ended only to try to launch reaction post interview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">Famous Scott Peterson skidded by using past while pretending that his assassinated wife was alive, launching a national research to find it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The misleading individuals can also use an outdistanced language: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or to repeat entirely a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal indicators are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Somebody can use a lot of "political cant" during his answer to a difficult question: "Oh well to say plainly if I remember property in my knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="43">It returns factual rather than perceptive answer and is often a red flag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There isn't magic formula as the detection of lies, but the development of competences to admit deceit is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These competences will improve chances of whoever to avoid the victimisation by swindlers in their professional and personal life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The plan of controversial oil pipeline will be put off after the threat of late approval of the United States</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Some days after the administration of Obama threatens to postpone the approval of a plan of oil pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking the anger of labour unions while appeasing the environmentalists - the society trying to construct the said oil pipeline that it is ready to re-run plan to delay it on rails.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">TransCanada declared on Monday evening that it is going to move the pipeline cast out of the ecologically sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and am confident that plan is however going to earn its approval.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The society announced decision during a press conference in Capitoline of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="5">The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, maintains that the company remains confident that it will end up getting the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It follows the announcement by the State department last week when it would postpone its decision of conferment of a federal licence for plan until it receives new studies of potential routes allowing to avoid the zones of the dunes of Nebraska and of water-bearing Ogallala, from large underground sources of water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"It is a true way forward", points out Lee Terry, a republican of Nebraska with Fox terrier News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new examination of environment ordered by the State department would have probably rejected any decision until 2013, after elections of next year, although the civil servants disclaim the involvement of politics in decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama, in a statement written last week, described decision as being the decision of the State department, and shone expressed his support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The 2,735 km oil pipeline would stretch of Canada towards the gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="11">Il transporterait 700 000 par barils jour depuis de la province de l'Alberta vers les raffineries du Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">In order to do that, it would be necessary to him to cross six States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">He is hated by the environmentalists, but liked by working parties, who bet on 20 000 jobs considered to be linked to the oil pipeline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the legislators of Nebraska compared to this plan lobby that a law for force the distance of the region of Sand Hills and of water-bearing Ogallala, a major source of drinking water and of irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The environmental environmental impact assessment in the course of the State department found that plan would put down only limited negative environmental impacts, but the industry of energy declared that the general inspector of the ministry ordered an inquiry distinct from the process of examination, centered on two questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The one is that a lobbyst hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser of countryside of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other one is to know if a firm which was engaged to lead initial study was an inappropriate choice all over its relation in TransCanada.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">While Kevin Monk is going to search the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the foyer of their building of the boulevard Riverside with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in the arms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Roseanna Monk declared that she had stopped near the door and put down her daughter for instant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Somebody arrived behind me and said to me: "Do you Know what makes your daughter?" I said " yes " and I went to search her", she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">LABELLE admonished with anger the pregnant woman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"She said to me about tone aggressive: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door", says Roseanna Monk.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I answered him: "what you say or think doesn't interest me".</seg>
<seg id="11">She became fanatical and began using swearwords - word "" and word "" in a strong voice...</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Later, the family sent a note asking for excuses of LABELLE, but got no answer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle didn't turn our calls to comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Complaint claims not specified damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, declared that he took case free and that the family plans to give all money received in a charity activity against the cancer for the children.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="21">"This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially towards a teacher of nursery school carrying a 18-month-old child."</seg>

<seg id="4">The low temperatures of February, apart to cause losses of billions for agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the economy of the State for growth, caused a shrinkage of economic activity in general by 3,6 for one hundred in the first semestre of the year, justified mainly by review lower 31,16 for one hundred in agriculture, which affected dynamism of other one economic sectors.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The unemployment in Sinaloa during year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantès, manager of the Faculty of Economic and social sciences of UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to actions accomplished by the public policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What is noticed it is an increase in the unemployment which is due to various factors, between that the loss of liquidity on the market owed to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in the Congress to fight the laundering of money, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way it isn't easy that they work to earn them, that they invest them and use them in something", he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Kept migration</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Contraction d'IED</seg>

<seg id="25">"The output of the economy of Sinaloa during this year was indeed very poor, it is necessary to work intensely to recover the ground which we lost this year, in 2012 we must double effort our, it was necessary to line up the effort of all and especially the good walk already synchronised of this new team of Government, let's hope that next year is much better", has he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Court validates " the analogical cut " in Mexico in 2015</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Substitution of signal analogical by the digital one of the exchange rates more important is than the world endured last years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) nonsuited constitutional controversies that Senat and Chamber of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree which moves forward the said "analogical cut" from 2021 till 2015, because eight necessary polls to invalidate it weren't united.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, enclosed the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that the president Felipe Calderón didn't exceed his attribution when he issued the decree which details actions to be followed to make transition concrete on the digital television of the Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was nonsuited not to have attained the qualified majority of eight polls so that the Court pronounces on the constitutionalité or not - constitutionalité of the decree, and this continues being in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The plan of sentence, worked out by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, offered the statement of the decree as non-constitutional, because of fact that the regulation in radio and television is an attribution reserved by law for the Federal Committee of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in infraction of the principles of hierarchic subordination and of reservation of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In favour of plan voted only for Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and for Sánchez Cordero.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">With this argument, so much the Senate as the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to question the decree and by accepting complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions envisaged by this one for digital transition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The plenary session of the ministers solved to nonsuit also the complaint formulated by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the plan the minister Sánchez Cordero of which is also representative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In its intervention, the minister govern said that he didn't agree with arguments of plan, in sense that federal Executive can't structure measures through general norms so that the public administration gets ready for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"I consider either than if he made it they would affect the autonomy of the regulating organ", and he reminded that the planning of public policies in strategical domains as the sector of telecommunications is the responsibility of the federal Executive, for constitutional mandate with the direction of the State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Substitution of signal analogical by one signal digital one of the changes the most important is that the world suffered last years and it is translated in a better working of the radioelectrical spectre, a better quality of the signal and more chains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">To defer change, has him supported, would be defer the benefits of the digitalisation which implicates a decision of public interest not only with one technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political questions and national security".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">These questions, has it underlined, "demand the operation of the whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of attribution which Constitution grants in the faculty of the Executive of the State".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">He reminded that a big number of countries of everybody has already finished digital transition and they made it through Executive, in spite of the fact that they had the extremely specialised technical organs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It isn't possible to conclude that Executive, by issuing the questioned decree, pervades in a form the sphere of competences of the Congress, because he assures in the administrative sphere the respect for laws issued by Legislative, he assured.</seg>

<seg id="3">The possibility of discount "vote by vote" is a reality as regards electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to data highlighted by the Programme of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between the first one and the second place of the election of the governor is only 27 for one hundred, even without counting corresponding polls in 879 of 6 thousand and 74 complete minutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this direction, the president of the County council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María of los Á ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that some days ago, the past November 9th, the electoral organ approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local norms in re-forms her federal in electoral material.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">They will remember that Michoacán didn't approve either its Political Constitution or its State franchise act or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the Congress of the State approved re-form them a little before whom finishes the lawful delay so that this electoral trial could come into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel skipped his publication for the delays envisaged by the Law of the Official journal of the State, with argument of when he had some objections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On the same November 9th, the Supreme Court of justice of the Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by Power Legislative place and described as to be " disabled and illegal " the vote of the deputy of the state for re-form them constitutional, because he doesn't have the right to punish them "or to question them".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María of los Á ngeles Llanderal declared that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the County council of IEM it will be possible to accomplish the partial and complete discounts of polls by the local electoral organ.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">So, the partial discount of polls, of one or several electoral packets, it is possible that: the results of minutes coincide; there aren't minutes of polls and discount in the file of the ballot box isn't at the president's of this one; or there are errors or obvious impairments of minutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Besides, the complete discount of polls received in all ballot boxes of election will be able to be accomplished when there is an indication due to the fact that the difference between the winning supposed candidate of respective election and the one who got the second place in polls is equal or by underside of a point of percentage; on the condition of that at the beginning of session exists an express petition of the representative of the party and/or alliance which introduced the second of the signalled candidates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The complete discount of polls can come true also if at the end of common discount it results that the difference between the winning supposed candidate and that of the second place is equal or lower in a point of percentage, on the condition of that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party of which the candidate went out second, case in which they will exclude the electoral packets which are object of partial discount.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is necessary to mention that it is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0,16 pourcent, even without counting the polls of 129 of 923 complete minutes.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The indicated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the president of Italy to introduce the new government which will face up one crisis which put Italy at the edge of economic disaster and jeopardised all Eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A press release of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.</seg>
<seg id="5">They wait that he introduces an office composed in her majorities by the technocrats, even if he am not clear when new executive will take its post.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said that he is going to introduce to the president the result of the dialogues with the political parties in the trial to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult stage", said the ancient European Commissioner to the journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti didn't say expressly that he could form a government, but the tone of the comments pointed out that obstacles were overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The "frame is drawn well now", he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti supplemented process to form a government in less than three days, in more reduced time than normally, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis which pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration run by the ancient European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard packet of austerity demanded by the European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy which had been affected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">By underlining pressure on Monti so that he hurries up, the instability of markets in putting the output of Italian obligations BTP in 10 years over of 7 for one hundred, the level in which Greece and Ireland must duu be saved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, leader of employers' Italian Confindustria, said in media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government a lot".</seg>
<seg id="14">We think that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy goes out of this urgent situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The possibilities of success of Monti were considerably stimulated by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, in which crisis made resign the passed Saturday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We think that efforts of the professor Monti will have a good result", declared to the press Angelino Alfano, right secretary of the party of centre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of PDL, the biggest Italian party, is significant because up to now many its members had opposed to the Government of majority technocrat whom Monti forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be of re-form austerity unpopular.</seg>
<seg id="20">Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause new and destructive one attack of financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian association of foreign benches added up in pressure by noticing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began the consultations on Monday with the political parties, labour unions and employers' groups and youthful organisations and of women.</seg>
<seg id="23">He will finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday in night.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorised an extremely quick transition in reply to crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a short respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi is going to resign, the costs of Italian debt returned now to critical levels between uncertainty on the success of the new prime minister.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To save Italy, with a national debt of 1,9 billions of euro, it would be too much for current financial defences of Eurozone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said that the Government should persist up to future elections, envisaged for 2013, in spite of predictions generalised on the fact that the politicians will give him only the time to apply re-form them before moving elections forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said that he would like to include politicians in the office, but the big parties stress the fact that this one must be only formed by specialists, an indication of their objections in front of a process obliged by financial pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources signalled that reciprocal mistrusts and disagreement between parties complicate trial to include political faces.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if 22 calling by both countries for the friendly today's, in 15:05 the hours, with the National Stadium of San José are compared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">While the national champions and from Europe, number one of the monthly classification of FIFA, count an ample register of games inter-choose class A, the Tricolour only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have 50 international matches.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is an extract of dialogue, complete transcription of which is in Nación on Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For his Costa Rican supporters, the fact that Pearl Jam will occur in Costa Rica is a dream brung into being. Are you aware of what your fans live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To go to Costa Rica is a dream which brung into being for us too.</seg>
<seg id="11">This one is our second time in South America and Power station and until now it was grandiose.</seg>
<seg id="12">I passed holiday in Costa Rica only once; it is such a nice country and I think that we will be able to spend some days there.</seg>
<seg id="13">It émotionne us therefore to carry our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion towards the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.</seg>
<seg id="15">What is your message for your most fervent supporters?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you for staying next to us during every these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">21 years were needed so that we arrive at Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so much and we are sorry due to the fact that so much time had to pass up to this concert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some persons already say that his concert is the bigger show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">It adds a little of pressure to your visit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the bigger shows than we gave during last 21 years took place in two last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We gave one two colossal shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that it shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are really very impatient to occur there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We like this country, we want to go surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to go surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have many friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lived in Tamarindo and waves are incredible there.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends always went to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in quoting of Mexico, big places are to go surfing; that's how we learnt him, across the races who like the surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">By seeing tour, aves you given by the huge shows, with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As we have never occurred there, we have no restriction as regards what we can make.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to make the best possible show, with a big variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of every album and to give to our fans a good and various directory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat the directory.</seg>
<seg id="32">In what owes it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think that it is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, it is for it that it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every party.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the directory that we didn't interpret any more since for a long time, it helps us to remain concentrated and surprises us because it reminds us of reasons for which we liked these songs and what we can have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">It makes that show is more interesting for us and as a result I think that it also becomes more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="37">By looking behind, is it difficult to believe all that you achieved?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">Above all, I think that none of us had imagined who we alloy to form a big group rock, and fact that we have made it for more than 20 years makes that it seems to be a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We continue telling our blessings and fact to be able to continue practising music together émotionne us a lot.</seg>
<seg id="41">We like each other and we love creating music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky to go to places of the world to which we always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things couldn't go better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What means for you fact to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It was always a honour for us to form part of this group of big groups.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are very friend of people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when a movement comes into sight from a group of friends and is not very common.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, a group comes into sight from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups go out at the same time of the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and it is a honour for us to form part of the group of Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">We still play with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">The last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, therefore we are lucky to be still friend of all them and it is a honour for us to form part of this sound of Seattle which has comes into sight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is as very strange as a group as your stays united and with the same members for so much time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us were together during 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only it is much more time that many groups last normally.</seg>
<seg id="54">Above all, I think that we are all lucky to be still living and, in second place, we are all concerned for others.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are friend intimate and favour has it there are musical boulevards which give freedom to each to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have confidence some in others with the music of each and it couldn't go better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relation with word publicity wasn't easy; however, thanks to your success, you could make what you want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How do you find a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we grew, it was easier for us to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We make sure due to the fact that we don't pass too much time in tour because it is easy to fall in this game of big multitudes and of people who like your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">If they don't forget that people are for music, it there help us not to forget that it is necessary to respect music and what brought it, without taking into the head the fact that they are famous and a rock star, what really interests to none of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How do you remember your other plan, Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="3">The local competition on 16 doors opens once again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Towards the middle of the years '80, in full peak of already - put out Underground Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed small posters of promotion of Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The booklet defined the mountain as the big park of underground Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besides, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Exchange Park of New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of CMB, in 1987, the park became once again, in the imagination of many people, limits it superior of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one who doesn't turn on the north-south axle, otherwise high (mountain) - bottom (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The skills of Collserola as nature park are to the advantage of this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reference wasn't more Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with boars in the role of the bear Yogi.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was situation until, in September, the city council called a mega-competition composed by 16 competitions for all doors of access to Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door delays at the idea of park, unquestionably.</seg>
<seg id="12">That's exactly, or somebody wants to put doors in the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">Apparait question all alone: Collserola: park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The competition, so much as regards its organisation as as regards reflexion on the city is a topic of dialogue of all architects of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a recurrent topic about which two members of this ancient clique of elected representatives speak when they recognise themselves in a lift.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it is just one of the rare opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who came there.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: competition is opportune.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán, having approached the forehead coastal "it is necessary" to discuss "the forehead of mountain" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of patties of green houses wasn't led at the end.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is necessary to leave the base that the more sprawling park of Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things for his big accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict the architect for whom title of "doors of Collserola" contains one " lexical trap ": you should be necessary think to these "as accesses to a park, but demarcation of some zones in which it is necessary to act".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies proposal as " intellectual challenge " with " some dangers ".</seg>
<seg id="23">Dangers which divert of "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in years '80 and which had in the zone of the Forum "its song of swan".</seg>
<seg id="24">First fright is the own demarcation of borders on which it is possible to construct.</seg>
<seg id="25">"To limit something means to establish already the following step", that is to say, his overtaking.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It is necessary to think of new urbanistic instruments, of planning, because the current [in reference to Underground General Plan (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">More held in question, Modol opine where, by simplifying, the mountainside of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol reminds that it already exists a job makes by the Employers of Collserola which "shouldn't be lost", by thanking for opportunity that the city council offers to its corporation to intervene in this plan "from the first instant".</seg>
<seg id="29">Besides, he hears that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct which allows to the architects to enter debate, but the "doubt " if it profiles technology is necessary run the multiple-subject teams (" the whole success ", he says) that they have to create: "Us, the architects, should be only an instrument".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question which gives the title of this room is complex, because bases of competition a total vision of Collserola is missing: "16 transverse competitions - were called he says - in sense mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading which sees and includes the zone as a whole".</seg>
<seg id="31">This makes, at least in that case, that he opts for participating in 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">In another way, a plan so that one of the doors could shock in the programme and definition with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In its opinion, yes, the city council should guarantee that the immediately upper band to that of Ronda de Dalt should envisage, in all its extension, a zone of equipment which performs a soft transition between the city and the green.</seg>

<seg id="10">For the moment, the secretary assured that a priority is to have results as quickly as possible; but investigation can last some months, she can even last one year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In its turn, Gilberto López Meyer, managing director of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that the instant of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State quickly worked of cabin cruiser and it took place on an ascending soft soil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This information supports the normal hypothesis of a functioning cabin cruiser at the time of has an impact on it", he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">During press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in investigation:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Visual flight:</seg>
<seg id="15">According to normative aicraft, flight was accomplished according to the rules of visual flight, what implicates that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the soil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Meteorological conditions:</seg>
<seg id="17">Reports in AICM mentioned conditions adequate to take-off, and to fur and has measure which the plane moved forward towards the bordering zone between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at weak height.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Chosen roads:</seg>
<seg id="19">He is probable qu "because of conditions of cloudiness the crew searches a zone of weaker height and more visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Location of has an impact on him.</seg>
<seg id="21">Co-ordinates of it have an impact on him and the last recording of the plane on the coincident radar, probably before an impact on it had neither loss of control nor impairment of the trajectory of flight there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Dispersion of the rests of the plane in a reduced zone:</seg>
<seg id="23">The available information until now allows to assume that has an impact on it took place on a right and lateral trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="24">The model of dispersion of the rests of the plane allows to assume that the helicopter collided against the soil in conditions of structural integrity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Traces of fire or of explosion weren't discerned:</seg>
<seg id="26">In the place of the disaster there is still no trace in the rests of the plane of a type of explosion or fire.</seg>
<seg id="27">The last results of investigation point out that the plane had had numerous contacts with the soil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">During fieldwork rooms of the plane at a height of 9 thousand and 200 200 feet above the mean sea level were found, the soil introduced a slope which goes since seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Photographs show the sequence in which he possibly contorted itself during his itinerary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Information gives elements which seem to point out that the helicopter can have had of have an impact numerous with the soil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">After meticulous research in a zone more ample than the encircled place, around accident, rooms weren't found disperse the plane, what supports presumption of that impact took place in conditions of structural integrity.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Social Insurance runs an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of the children and young people; this is supported by specialists of the IPN</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that he runs an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called protocol 'Genetics of the obesity of the children and teenagers' which will allow to have markers linked to the overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In a press release, the leader of the Unit of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialities of the National Health centre of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that one multiple-subject team of doctors had been formed, nurses, nutritionists and attend social.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team is supported by specialists and students of third cycle of the National Institute of Public health (INSP) and of the Centre of Investigation and of Moved forward Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To investigation they invite to participate the having population or not straight, to come in sports units participants of the IMSS to Valle de México, where is made proof to the miners every Saturday from 8:00 the hours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He underlined that the protocol began in Unit sportswoman Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8th, activity takes place in Unit sportswoman de Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Having reached target to unite 500 or 600 miners, study will go on in Unit sportswoman Independencia (in the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in Unit sportswoman Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the objective of this investigation and that e connaitre components and importance of genetics as regards the development of obesity and to identify at the children's and Mexican young people of risk factors to tell the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">As they will celebrate on November 14th the worldwide Day of Diabeteses, he mentioned that objective is that to unite three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to feeding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">One will ask also on their physical activity and their antecedents of family heredity of their diseases for them, to avoid risk factors which launch affections as diabetes or renal insufficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">He detailed that every Saturday weight, size, circumference of size will be applied to all participants of measuring anthropométriques (), arterial pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycérides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (they try to identify people linked to infantile obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz López signalled that this investigation is the fruit of the preoccupation of the professionals of health for frightening weighty taking in the case of the miners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">'The inquiries of health of 1999 and 2006 signalled that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of the boys, of 77 for one hundred in obesity and in the case of the girls of 47 for one hundred; as regards the overweight a dramatic increase was also noticed', underlined the specialist of the IMSS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">He pointed out that the justification for the research of markers is based due to the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He informed that on average, the Mexican have one 65 as one hundred indo-American heredities, one 30 for one hundred European and one five for one hundred Africain and this condition is reflected in people linked in diabeteses and overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is translated in inability of bruler the excess of energy that they consume that (calories), which settles in the form of grease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The researcher explained that the benefit direct for the participants it is the entire valuation of the children, what allows to discern if they introduce a degree of overweights or of obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ila having even said as the presence of the creases of dark colour (Acanthosis) on the neck and the forearm point out likelihood to suffer from metabolic impairments and even pre-diabeteses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors delay it in writing to the parents, they explain each measures to which of and changes in the lifestyle which they have to accomplish to tell diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz López explained that there is three main components who cause overweight, obesity and other chronic affections: the sédentarisme, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to remain most day sat in front of the television and to use means of transport instead of walking on short distance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another reason is the high caloric intake, that is to say the biggest consumption of sweet drinks, hydroxides of carbon (tamales - patty of meat in the flour of corn enveloped in leaves of corn - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high contents of grease and proteins and the genetics analysed in this protocol.</seg>

<seg id="1">The asphalt of UNAM would avoid blackcurrants</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researcher the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalt changed with polymers to produce a mixture with a better output, independently of environmental conditions and of temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If signal it that the paving were solved, it wouldn't be necessary any more to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants every wet season in the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, informs Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of building and maintenance of the bituminous paving is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">During its conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organised as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt changed with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those some asphalt, but with a bigger mechanical resistance, so much to high as low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera thought that this type of changed asphalt could be used in places in which climate is extremely hot, as some cities from the north of the country, to improve output, and as a result, training of blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltènes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give its characteristics to the paving viscoélastique behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Behaviour viscoélastique some asphalt consists of the fact that in high temperatures, of about 180 degrees, its viscosity acts as a liquid, to 120 degrees C am very big and to 50 degrees C he introduces an almost solid state, while in very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It means that on streets the resistance of the asphalt isn't uniform and changes during day according to environmental conditions and to temperature, informs the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researcher of the FQ noticed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible paving, composed of six layers of materials, among which three last implicate the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small bathed stones asphalts it and compactées later.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each of the small stones that forms the layer, he should signal, is bathed a year asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">When vehicles pass to it by generating efforts, this one allows that force spreads very well in the paving.</seg>
<seg id="13">If they had some changed asphalt, these would spread better, opinât to try hard it chemical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the layer of asphalt, he says, they put a last layer called layer of rotation, made stone fine, that is to say, of some sand which is also bathed in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As this one is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, she must have more mechanical force than the layer of asphalt and give sticking on the street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Being the part of the paving which receives and distributes efforts, the layer of rotation also demands that this one has an adequate thickness and a material which it is made is necessary be treated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Climate, especially humidity and variations of temperature, are also a factor very important to consider, especially the water, he says, because these affect considerably the output of the layer of asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer it is am difficult that this one goes out, what softened all layers of the paving and as a result reason of blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the trial of training of a blackcurrant, he says, the first one which spoils the layer of asphalt is the film of rotation and only later affected, but damage doesn't take place immediately, but it is a process which must be treated in the first signals with adequate programmes of maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member of the National System of the Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another factor mattering for the training of blackcurrant and as a result the thickness of every layer of the paving is always necessary be linked payable by vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent training of blackcurrant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera informed that there is still a lot to investiguer and to work bituminous emulsions on the asphalt, for example, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">What missed to the candidate of Valle to be the new miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors who made that Melina Ramírez Serna doesn't get miss's crown Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle receives the title number 14 of princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Once again Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to earn miss's crown Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content himself with fact to be on the catwalk of the winning, to carry the crown of money and the band which accredits him as new princess of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result got yesterday evening in Cartagena, where miss Atlántico went up with the crown and the sceptre, the department commands already 14 titles of Princess and Melina if one in a feminine legion of Valle del Cauca who was near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between who Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Á lvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Today the big question which a lot of people asks is:</seg>
<seg id="8">What was missing? Because result represents the defeat of a big favourite that in every presentation showed that it had it everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she hadn't been elected in vain Reine de la Police and Better Face Jolie de Vogue, pretty of titles got by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took miss's crown Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first key considered factor in the decision taken by the juror to indicate it First Princess is the fact that she didn't persuade with her answer to question"? What was the book which marked you and why? put down by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think that it is a form to culturaliser, definitely I think that the book which marked my childhood is " The small prince ", it is a rather deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature which we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, one Russian, a very nice book which is called "ardour of blood"".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This answer doesn't have plait first of all because of term "to culturaliser" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how every named book had marked it.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at the end of the ceremony Melina declared that she felt quiet and happy with result "the world and sage, there happens what must take place.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for everybody, read please a bit, " The small prince " is a big book"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Between thrown hypotheses there is that according to who Valle was destroyed by favoritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist of Bogota insinuated that being the favourite, the greeting with wide applause and the candidate who received all preliminary prices (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best craft costume, and Queen mother), "it awakened the jealousy of other candidates, put the queen on edge and it is for it that she didn't shine on the stage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And it in his first presentation in swimsuit in the beach of Hilton and its two parades of the day before coronation wasn'ted.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if in both parades she had seemed sure of herself even, they noted that she had no force and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "CoMb put it" (As at home), of the Channel RCN declared that the fact that Melina had been indicated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets competition most prices during doesn't receive queen's crown".</seg>
<seg id="21">Besides, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was one error.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis it is because Valle didn't succeed in persuading jury on the interest for social initiatives, which is in fact the petrol of the National Competition of Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is for it that two days before election the international swearing Lucy Doughty declared that they searched a woman hired as regards social necessities of her country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Only beauty isn't sufficient at a Miss's Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physical appearance and to centre on his social sensitivity, that before beginning Competition are already involved in plans", she explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">They speculate as as Valle sinned by the defects of sound behind and the fibrose who watched each other in its abdomen, but it is contradictory, because precisely jury elected him as the candidate ' natural Beauty ' with the healthier body, good feeding and responsible physical job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Reconnait queens' preparatory Jorge Hernán Orozco that Melina had no best body, that there was it better, "but the problem of fibrose on the abdomen, who in reality for me hadn't been too well-known, shone left points last day".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meantime the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle surgical operations were that she had suffered.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't make them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her body has never been her trump and she lost because of this aspect".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For this price, which the National Competition of Beauty delays for the first time, after parade in swimsuit has comes into sight one cruel prediction which was fulfilled yesterday evening, they said that it was a small present which Raymundo gave in Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins one year of reign, not as sovereign, otherwise as princess, today a position which gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of National Competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, she will pass in the history as one of the queens which in spite of sound dazzling passage by Cartagena, didn't get the crown.</seg>

<seg id="1">So the job of the person of Cali was who identified the body of Alfonso Cano</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A dactyloscopiste of Cali passed to history as man who confirmed the death of '"Alfonso Cano'.</seg>
<seg id="3">The job of these civil servants is crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Past November 4th a dactyloscopiste of CTI of Cali passed to history as person who confirmed the identity of the commander in chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability' of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipes of Shock ó, where a lot of times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place in which were bodies qu had to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Year 2000 it became transferred to the capital of Valle and having does adequate courses, it specialised in dactyloscopie, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say palms and feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">During the week of operation against alias Alfonso Cano they had informed in Eliazar to take clothes with him at least for three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Something very big waited for him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On Friday at night he left for Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that they suspected that one of them was that of the man who ran the more ancient guérrilla of the world, as a result they asked him to lose temper the card with ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (its true name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But when he arrived with the team of investigation towards the body, he didn't admit him by his physical aspect, because this one very differred from the one that he had seen in media.</seg>
<seg id="13">He didn't have beard, he was dressed as a peasant of the zone, without glasses and much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But footprints don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accompanied by a magnifier galtonienne, of some ink, a préleveur and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.</seg>
<seg id="16">The eye deceived him not: it was of '"Alfonso Cano".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The same night, the man native to Puerto Tejada was the representative who confirmed to the minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was about the commander in chief of Farc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In search of footprint</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali the recognition that the president Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for operation against "Cano", am very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people of connait not our job.</seg>
<seg id="21">The dactyloscopie is a precise science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Apart to identify bodies, dactyloscopistes supports investigations for offences as flight and the homicide and confirms the identity of the captured persons.</seg>
<seg id="23">When are captured, many delinquents introduce wrong identity cards or don't have documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">We take their fingerprints and search them in database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The researcher narrated that in a case of flight he had to take away a part of wall of a home, because in this place the thief had supported the hand to get outside a safe full of jewellery and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Walls are difficult because they aren't adequate areas to draw fingerprints, but in that case we could get the footprint of all hand and identify with the delinquent who had participated in different flights", he remembers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Footprints can also move aside or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recently a dead man, with bottles of drink around him was found.</seg>
<seg id="29">By interlude of investigation they determined that a parent can be suspicious of crime and indeed a footprint on the bottle coincided.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even if it no guarantees not that he is the murderer, it puts him on the stage of crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A dactyloscopiste of CTI explained that they extract "the fingerprints of objects with one reactive chemical or physical".</seg>
<seg id="32">When they appear, a préleveur or a band are used to take a sample of them.</seg>
<seg id="33">Subsequently, footprints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or to the National Civil Register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"Problem is that there are some more Colombians without papers", pointed out the expert of the CTI.</seg>
<seg id="35">He explained that everything isn't how they show in TV programme CSI.</seg>
<seg id="36">As all that shines isn't gold, everything that is touched forcing doesn't become a footprint.</seg>
<seg id="37">She can however be used, if necessary confrontation is accomplished.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of demonstrators bumped into each other in front of the place Zuccotti to camp there.</seg>
<seg id="3">A lot of the persons achieved the order of evacuation and moved in a neighbouring park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The integrant of movement Occupy Wall Street outbraved on Tuesday the authorities of New York by trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where from they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of demonstrators bumped into each other in front of the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to achieve thanks to a judicial order which allows the 'indignant ' to camp once again in this place, while the other part of movement answered evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there was new stopping.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp once again in the place, we are going to become established in another place and we will continue lawful struggle to go back in Zuccotti, and in foible sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", says one of the doors-words of movement "Occupies Wall Street", Mark Bray.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Bray detailed that the answer of the 'indignant ' to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived up to courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued a command which forbade the evacuation forced by the place and allowed to the demonstrators to stay in the camp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Besides, the 'indignant ' occupied a new park located in the confluence of power stations Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance in the tunnel Holland, which joins New York and New Jersey, property of the parish Trinity Church.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At least during one hour they succeeded in occupying the place, but after the Police moved there and stopped some demonstrators, even if Bray couldn't confirm the concrete figure, by assuring Efe due to the fact that he saw some journalists to which handcuffs had been also passed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The organisation assures that there are centenaries of persons who had become established in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of movement and tried to intervene in favour of them in front of the Police.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Meantime, the place Zuccotti - which is a surrounding wall of private property - rest closed by waiting for the celebration of a judicial audience envisaged by this Tuesday during which it is necessary to analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Some displaced demonstrators until then carried and distributed at this hour the copies of this judicial order and they delivered it even to the agents who watched the place, what caused ' some small clashes ', pointed Bray out, who reported the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Judicial order forbids to the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupe Wall Street or to apply 'laws published after the beginning of occupation or to forbid to the demonstrators to achieve the park once again with tents or other properties which they used before'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The mayor Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, to which he however alerted due to the fact that local laws don't allow them to become established with tents and bags to sleep.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The GDP raises one 1,5 % thanks to consumption domesticates and puts an end to the spiral of fall of the beginning of March</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Since March Japanese economy thought it was paralysed, it was convalescent even after destructive earthquake which became nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the Japanese country since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated material losses in 300.000 millions dollars, a blow which, in spite of difficult worldwide context, seems to have eased.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross domestic product between July and September served to turn over a new leaf definitely: the GDP raised one 1,5 % in comparison with the previous quarter and one 6 % in annualisé rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">That recorded the second quarter - for Japanese, the tax year begins in March, 2012 - assumes, on top of that, the biggest rhythm of increase since period from January till March, 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recovery explains, partly, by the resumption of the acquisitions of equipment to restore zones devastated by the earthquake and posterior tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, firms augmented their investments by 1,1 %, in comparison with fall of 0,9 % expenses of capital noticed from January till March, the first detachment after six months of non-interrupted increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, truth stimulate Japanese economy is exclusively based on the impulse Keynesian which invites to use crisis to consolidate - or to rebuild - facilities, to use deficiencies for croitre of zero.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan woke up especially thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, which currently represents 60 % Japanese GDPS.</seg>
<seg id="11">This variable raised a 1 %, pushed by the increase in expenses on vehicles, trips and activities of entertainment.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">The stigma of the yen</seg>

<seg id="14">With separate stronger one, products are more expensive abroad, a serious back for a country the line of economic wavering of which is determined by the health of the big technological groups.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda doesn't lower the nurse.</seg>

<seg id="9">So, Her Majesty explained that objective is that at the end of 2015 there is 175 million poor families which achieved these financial services and which hundred millions of these families take out from the threshold of poverty in which they live now.</seg>

<seg id="1">CDU offers to elect the European president to universal suffrage</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14th, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democrat party.</seg>
<seg id="3">The future of Europe wasn't initially envisaged in the programme but was obvious to autumn, notably to satisfy the activists who judge the politics of the too lax government in relation to the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4">The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, offered by direction, was adopted in almost unanimity.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 1001 delegates, only new voted against and for ten refrained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Social status ovation of several minutes to which had the right, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel then, some hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, europhile very Minister of Finance, didn't leave place in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The topping idea of the chancellor - and motion - holds in a slogan: the answer to crisis "is no less than Europe but more Europe".</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe, it is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For the chancellor, "the time came from a breakthrough in Europe".</seg>
<seg id="10">It could be translated by modifications in the treaty of Lisbon allowing to reinforce the control of the European Union of the fiscal policies of the countries of the euro area, but it could also result in the election of the president of the European Commission in universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".</seg>
<seg id="11">Such is anyway one of the proposals of motion adopted by the congress the initiator of which is apparently Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Certainly, it is unlikely that Twenty-seven agree fast about this revolution: Great Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is it also.</seg>
<seg id="13">But milestone is put down.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also, the delegates rejected proposal to an overwhelming majority to balance the weight of every country to the board of directors of the European central Bank according to the weight of every economy, what of course returned to reinforce the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Anxious with appeasing climate inside her party, the chancellor multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl Mais she either didn't try to earn her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or of the in trouble prompt countries to criticise arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">If the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of French-German friendship ", Angela Merkel didn't recall France.</seg>
<seg id="17">Safe in hollow.</seg>
<seg id="18">By reminding that the two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the middle of bloody battle.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, it was one of the most mortifying undoing of the napoleonic army.</seg>

<seg id="1">What represents the fraud to stopping illness?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After benefits, UMP and government throw offensive on stopping illness.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15th in Claret to visit a Social Security Office, and to pronounce a speech on topic - recurrent since 2007 - of the struggle against social fraud and assistantship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And to accompany this offensive, which leaves a will to make savings in an essential context, but is not less warning of an axle of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority want to concentrate on stopping illness.</seg>
<seg id="5">First in a purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on the wage earners of the private a fourth day of deficiency before the taking care of a stoppage of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Clearly, without agreement of specific firm, a wage earner who falls ill would lose four days of wage, therefore at least 15 % of his monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A measure which risks provoking anger, but that would allow to bring back 280 million euro, according to Echoes.</seg>
<seg id="8">And who would be accompanied with another measure, with more symbolic range: impose on the civil servants a day of deficiency not indemnified in case of stoppage of work (they don't have waiting period until now, against three days in private life).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these questions are under discussion, the majority also restart the themes of fraud, targeting this time abuses linked to stoppage of work.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Controls are going to be much more important and, on top of that, if you are taken, you will reimburse", informed Xavier Bertrand in the microphone of RTL, Sunday, November 13th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As for other cases, the effects of announcement seem a little disproportional with the reality of fraud to stoppage of work.</seg>
<seg id="12">This one indeed makes the object since 2002 of a constant monitoring and political offensives, which most often carried their fruits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Frenchmen no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Let's delay us first on the national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the national Case of health insurance (CNAM), more than 237 million euro of sick pays were issued in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the Institute of research and of material in economy of health, sick pays represented health in 2008 5 % expenses of, with 11,3 thousand million euro.</seg>
<seg id="17">On this sum, 46 % concerned maternity leaves and industrial accidents, and 54 % concerned stopping illness, that is 6,2 thousand million euro.</seg>
<seg id="18">And therefore 2,5 % expenses of health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, Frenchmen knew on average 14,5 days of stoppage of work, against 17,8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Alma Consulting.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average which hides certain distances: another inquiry, published in 2007 by the site of management of career Monster.com, showed that 75 % 40 000 questioned French wage earners told it had taken no day of stopping illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time of the Health insurance, adds that in 2010, 37 % of stopping illness were of a lower length in 8 days, 22 % from 8 to 14 days, 15 % from 15 days to month, 15 % from one to three months and 11 % beyond.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When they are compared with their European neighbours, the wage earners Frenchmen aren't more disposed than elsewhere in stoppage of work.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long study led in 2010 by two researchers of the NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of total absence (for health reasons or not) wobbled, in France, between 10 % and 11 %, against 20 % and 28 % in Denmark, 15 % in the United Kingdom or 16 % and 18 % in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Fraud in stopping illness represents little facing illicit work.</seg>
<seg id="25">As for fraud, she attains only a weak largeness.</seg>
<seg id="26">The strengthening of legislation since 2002 makes that controls are systematic on stopping illness of more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, on 1,5 million controls, CNAM noted that 13 % 285 000 accomplishing for short-term stopping was "unjustified or too long", is 37 050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of the stopping of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11 % of " maladjusted or unjustified" cases on 1,2 million, they that is 132 000 were counted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In total, therefore 169 000 "unjustified" cases, on several million wage earners having had a stopping illness.</seg>
<seg id="30">A figure which represents face very little, for example, to that of illicit work.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to DEPUTY UMP DOMINIQUE TIAN, author of a report on question in June, this one would represent 9 - 15 thousand million euro of lack to be earned tax a year, is more than total cost of sick pays, and therefore infinitely more than fraud in these last.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The Canadians live in the denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In palliative care, the committee demands that governments, institutions of healthcare, and doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and it, beyond cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian society lived in the denial of death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9 % Canadians indeed agree to speak with their doctor of conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements with this effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, in which participated six experts linked up with various domains, among which ethics, right and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">This committee recommends to the government to change criminal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is obvious, to a patient considered competent to make such decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">From the start, the experts name a recent inquiry of Economist Intelligence Joins, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Canada ranked 10th there, study notes that "the médicalisation of death in Canada procreated a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Médicalisation or not, 77 % Canadians don't have access to palliative care, bring to us back the experts delegated by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And in spite of the wish which have most Canadians to die at home, 68,6 % of them end up dying in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the whole, from the country, it is in the Quebec where this rate is the highest, with 86 % dead happening in the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the delicate question of euthanasia and of assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which go contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already told he wants to change nothing in the criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">And yet according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalised or decriminalized, there is no proof that this decriminalization draws abuses away in application, that is to say practice of euthanasia or of suicide assisted on consenting or not not competent persons.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, asserted in teleconference yesterday Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the report, more many cases of these excesses precisely in the countries would be found where euthanasia and assisted suicide aren't legalised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal".</seg>
<seg id="17">"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadians favourable to euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let's remind that 85 % Canadians were already pronounced in favour of euthanasia because they think that she would allow to the persons at the end of life to lighten their suffering, according to an opinion poll Angus Reid was performed in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66 % think that fact to legalise euthanasia won't have the effect of sending the message which the life of the old persons or disabled persons has less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for the persons having practiced the assisted suicide, the polling think at 41 % that they shouldn't be followed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In maintaining or suspension of care to a patient, situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is pointed out in criminal Code that the withdrawal of care as which there was a legally valid refusal isn't criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The committee of experts also asks that the professionals of health are formed in duty to respect a refusal of care at the end of life, without fearing criminal chases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In palliative care, the committee demands that governments, institutions of healthcare, and doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and it, beyond cases of cancer.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, complained a little of time in markets to form his team and to implement a programme, which will contain sacrifices ", to recover the credibility lost in last months of the government Berlusconi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The ancient European Commissioner was under discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting labour unions and employers today.</seg>
<seg id="5">He should set up a relatively restrained office composed of external technocrats to the Parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Monti spoke about a programme mattering with many sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of many small parliamentary groups hired in discussions, having met the indicated head of government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, told from his part he expected that Mario Monti solicits by Friday a vote of confidence to the Parliament to make sure which the new government disposes of a sufficient support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Consultations will end by presentation by Mr Monti of a restrained list, undoubtedly of a dozen of ministers, to the leader of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, by asking them of time.</seg>
<seg id="10">In "democracy, there are definite delays" to prepare a government and its programme, he underlined, claiming "to be certain that markets will be patient and include".</seg>
<seg id="11">Its designation by the president had been initially greeted by markets, but concern notably regained the upper hand after an unexpected fall of industrial production in euro area in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The indicated prime minister should constitute a team understanding technocrats especially, even if he underlined that he would like to include "politics " there.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new government must last until 2013, date of the next general elections, he estimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of the Parliament before Friday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Mr Monti got involved, once took up the post, to work in emergency and with the intention that Italy "becomes again protagonist" in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">A spokesperson of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn underlined that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on Italian economy doesn't change".</seg>
<seg id="17">The EU, persuaded that Rome won't reach its target of balance in the budget in 2013 in spite of the plans of austerity adopted these last months, asked notably for new essential measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The "patroness of the Italian bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the necessity to restart economy, "because a country without growth can't respect the parametres of deficit".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Mr Monti, reputed for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconisme", the representing "professor" "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the leader writers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The big unknown will be the longevity of the team.</seg>
<seg id="21">The president Napolitano would like to avoid preliminary elections, because Italy must put before April, 2012 for 200 thousand million euro of State obligations.</seg>

<seg id="9">In its last report, AIEA recalls "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a system of nuclear detonation "was helped by the job of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technology well, but who, as a Member state informed about it the Agency, worked during the basics of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".</seg>

<seg id="22">So, any significant reduction on behalf of nuclear technology would procreate a sharp increase of price of l "electricity, which would return nice statements delusive on the réindustrialisation of our country and defence of the purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">A price which a large majority of Frenchmen refuse to pay, all the more so as they don't demonstrate fundamental opposition to this energy, opinion polls show it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let's remind that the energy policy of our country allowed to build an industrial course of study of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 led jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Strongly exporting, she draws away a galaxy of SMES specialised on the international markets and makes them very creative of jobs délocalisables not.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France came to decide to go out of nuclear technology, it would be sacrifice a good many of these SMES by reducing as shagreen 6 thousand million annual euro of French export d "equipment and nuclear services.</seg>
<seg id="27">What electrician would order EPR conceived to work sixty years while the decline of his producer would be programmed?</seg>
<seg id="28">To solve energy equation l ", it is necessary to suppose that there is source of production d" miracle electricity, no more than it exists of diabolic there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The development by Areva of CO2's not very broadcasting solutions, nuclear and renewable, manifests the complementarity of sources d "energy.</seg>
<seg id="30">For nuclear technology, to support the highest level of safety is an imperative absolute.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have in France an Authority of safety who exercises an uncompromising and transparent control of existent power stations as construction site of Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">One lives of the same fixed idea of safety in our teams, the professionalism of which is admitted.</seg>
<seg id="33">In half a century, nuclear industry knew three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">The only one, Three Mile Island, intervened in conditions of normal working; he stayed without environmental or human consequence.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Tchernobyl, the conception of reactor and of unpardonable human errors caused drama.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that accident results from two natural disasters of an unsurpassed largeness which caused the death of dozens thousand persons.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nuclear industry will draw the educations of this accident, as it had made it for both precedents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Fruit of this step and of a cooperation between the authorities of safety, the farmers and the French and German constructors, EPR introduces a conception making him capable of resisting such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">While it is considered by all electricians eager to construct a power station, the stopping of its building in Flamanville would be a splendid present given to the rivals of Areva and FRENCH ELECTRICITY COMPANY by leaving them the free way to take over leading role in the inevitable development of nuclear technology.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is necessary and legitimate to search the best energy bunch for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave l "emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the financial, social and financial status of our country.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Is the immigration a load or a chance for economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The politics in immigration led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised under various angles - blocking of the police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the politics of the figure, compatibility of this politics with status autoproclamé of "country of human rights" from France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, it is the administrative harassment the object of which the foreign students make which was in the news, Interior minister (read Liberalisation of May 23rd) proclaiming in passage that France "doesn't need foreign talents, bricklayers and servers of restaurant".</seg>
<seg id="4">But she is only seldom analysed under the economic angle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is because there is one on this subject enough large consensus enters left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">To the right, tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed persons shouldn't be a problem in a country understanding about 2 million immigrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't receive all misery of the world" in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, the fright of the plague of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left as to the right.</seg>
<seg id="9">For both edges, the immigrants are perceptible as a load for economy and French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is fond of the degree of generosity which they will deign to grant in relation to the immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In his programme, François Hollande stations in banality, pointing out that codevelopment will allow to resolve our "migratory problem".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as load, a problem, is perhaps paid électoralement; but it is economically very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As remind of it the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthetizing most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our intended, May, 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a large consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of influxes of immigrants on economic growth, wages and job in the countries which receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">To restrain immigration weakens growth and harms job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Fears in relation to the impact of the migrants are founded on the idea which these risk taking the place of the national workers, particularly few skilled, putting a pressure in fall on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are much supplementarier than substitutes to the national wage earners, practising for the basics of jobs in sectors in shortage of job.</seg>
<seg id="17">The not much qualified immigrants work in sectors which don't attract the national wage earners, and most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training doesn't follow the offer of jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Similarly than a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country which knows anaesthetists' shortage, this complementarity between national and migrants make that immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on wages and job of the national.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri so calculated that an increase in 1 % of influxes of immigrants draws away an increase included between 0,6 and 0,9 % long-term real wages.</seg>
<seg id="21">And it without taking into account the fact that diversity brought by the immigrants contributes to creation of ideas and to economic growth (strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo was founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants are also net contributors of the social systems, on average at the level of 1 % complete budget in the European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The worldwide Organisation of job thinks for example that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at age of 30 years will bring a net contribution (recipes less expenses) from 150000 euro to the public budgets on average on of his whole life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of mandate, to go to search the missing growing points "with teeth".</seg>
<seg id="25">Les bosselle demi-cadratin la question, demi-cadratin le domestique à dissuader les immigrants, ont eu l'exact effet l'inverse.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mainland Europe should be able to remember it him who, to have invented her in Athens more than two thousand years ago, knew during the XXth century tragedies of First World War, totalitarianisms, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some people could think that it would be enough, so that democracy should triumph definitely over his enemies, to exercise vote, and to exercise it in a most direct way which is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">They know, since Napoleon " the Baby ", that it was about an easiness of thought there.</seg>
<seg id="6">Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, isn't sufficient condition and can even make "instrument of oppression" as said in the past the republican philosopher Steven Vacherot.</seg>
<seg id="7">No, democracy requests much more: a public space, a public mind, stocks, an organisation, a separation and a control of powers, an education, from the Enlightenment, economic and social solidarities, a justice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The crisis of Europe which we live is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first a crisis of politics and democracy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The palinode of true-wrong Greek referendum will have had in this respect value of revealing double: that of the necessity of a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.</seg>
<seg id="10">This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="11">The truth is that the frontlines of democratic battle have moved today, and that, for many of them, the republican soldiers don't pull any more in good direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We have nothing to win to demand a succession of national referendums, organised to the liking of necessities and unsystematic order.</seg>
<seg id="13">A blank endorsement to the European absolute monarch or a jump with feet linked in the space of the nationalist fall: what a choice for the citizen!</seg>
<seg id="14">No, we don't want cleavers but an exercise, common, by right, serene and uninterrupted, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.</seg>
<seg id="15">There aren't crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - they wouldn't know besides any more where to stop listing l "- because there is no that a crisis, and she is in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is very whole Europe which submits to the diktats of markets and of agencies of notation, which suffers as a result of its impotence and its defect of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is very whole Europe which is humiliated on the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="18">They get worried about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - but it is very whole Europe which loses slowly its sovereignty, and with her each of its nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Emergency, it is to give again to popular sovereignty the piloting of European plan.</seg>
<seg id="20">Because it is together, that the Europeans will be able to take off weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare the future by investing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exit from crisis will assume decisions at European level which won't be able to be made without a complete democratic legitimacy, except of course to drive us to disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Having fought for a long time this proposal of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everybody claims the European economic government today.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is.</seg>
<seg id="24">But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart cards "without contact" spread</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The worldwide living room of the smart card opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.</seg>
<seg id="3">Year 2011 should indeed end on an increase in 11 % worldwide sales of smart cards (bank card, telephone with card SIM), in more than 6 thousand million units, according to the office Eurosmart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The most bearing segment is that of technology without contact which allows to pay public transport or to regulate its purchases by approaching simply the card of a reader.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold across the world, against 320 million one a year earlier!</seg>
<seg id="6">Their part should again advance in 2012 (580 million waited units) and to represent about 10 % total markets of the smart card (6,925 million cards).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">For a long time in the train of the region Asia-Pacific, Europe gains ground for the payment without contact.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 26 million bank cards Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75.000 terminals of payment accept it.</seg>
<seg id="9">In France, the beginning is more modest: 400.000 cards without contact Visa were displayed.</seg>
<seg id="10">But supermarkets work very hard.</seg>
<seg id="11">Crossroad so issued this year 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.</seg>
<seg id="12">To speed things up, banks have from now on to equip their clients.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Two big French establishments promised to diffuse in future systematically to their clients of bank cards equipped for without contact", announces Gérard Nébouy, managing director Visa Europe France.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Banks test the payment by motive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But it is only a first stage towards the means of payment of future: the mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Few apparatus are equipped with technology necessary NFC (Near Field Communication) today to perform transactions.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They fell behind".</seg>
<seg id="18">"But they should finally know a true development next year".</seg>
<seg id="19">"We bank on upon sale from 80 to 120 millions of units in 2012 in the world", explains Mark Bertin, president of Eurosmart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">But banks take the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="21">Agricultural Credit announced the launching of a test next from December till June in Caen yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="22">The iPhone of about 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.</seg>
<seg id="23">BPCE has a plan similar to Strasbourg and Marseilles.</seg>

<seg id="1">From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist forehead stretches</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Paris gets worried about links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Suspected well in advance, links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Sunday, Algerian minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even maintained that Algiers there "became convinced from now on".</seg>
<seg id="5">"The way both organisations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is cooperation well", he explained without more precision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris semble faire une analyse similaire.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inquiry into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have brought footbridges to light.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by fellows of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory must be killed the following day at the same time as some of their abductors during an operation thrown by French special force.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the debris of intervention, the investigating officers French and of Niger had to find several telephone fleas belonging to the terrorists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Terrorist axle</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The analysis of passed calls orientates to several interlocutors based in Mali, in Niger and in Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Radio International France (RFI), two numbers interest particularly the investigating officers: the one leads to an of Niger who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city from the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and other one to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and to the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is an advance but it is undoubtedly necessary to wait for more definite proof before speaking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".</seg>
<seg id="14">"But it is possible".</seg>
<seg id="15">"They know many years that the sect benefits from external financial and intellectual supports and that she proves to be more and more active", Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher tempers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These last months these "supports" had been more and more obvious in evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his surgical modes, which implicate appeal from now on to kamikazes or to more and more complex explosive devices and of the same bill as those used by Aqmi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, starting with Washington, since then lobbied on Abuja so that he takes into account problems put down by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities indeed considered the group for a long time to be a community of illuminating not very worthy of interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A quick success</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, around a school and of the iman fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means haoussa there "Western education is a sin" - advocates the institution of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this poor region, the association is a quick success.</seg>
<seg id="22">She becomes politicised and demands a strict respect for the sharia while her activists hire the struggle against the impious central government.</seg>
<seg id="23">These last aim first at churches, at bars, at administrations.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram prove to be particularly active, to be multiplying attacks against police stations.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reaction of Abuja is, as in its habit, without nuances.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army invests the city, one count 800 dead.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, living order, is killed in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since then the sect is going to become more radical and leaves its fiefs of the north.</seg>
<seg id="29">In last Christmas, she demands an assassination attempt which makes 80 dead to Jos, then other one to Abuja.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, it is still in Abuja where Boko Haram is taken in the HQ reassured by the police during an attack its first one commits suicide.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local seat of the United Nations will be its first international target.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of a terrorist axle in Africa which would sail from Mauritania to Somalia by way of Nigeria worries from now on all specialists of security.</seg>
<seg id="33">While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, while the Somalians of al-Chebab operate in on Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the middle of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, during a maintenance in Nigeria with the president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and claimed to be ready "to share all information".</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On China, on Iran, on assistant to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete of simplism and ignorance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can America weakened by crisis manage the complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic?</seg>
<seg id="4">To listen to the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.</seg>
<seg id="5">For some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others multiply thundering statements and abbreviated in foreign policy, traditionally a republican strong point.</seg>
<seg id="6">On China, on Iran, on assistant to Israel, slogans - often not supported - ring out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, best put in running in the nomination of "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chineses in front of OMC and to implicate them "for manipulation of their currency", a bearing topic in America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of the industry towards the Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Oh well if it must implicate the launching of a commercial war, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, ex-ambassador in China of Obama and the only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign policy, nearly strangled himself facing an attitude which "flatters " emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">He called to a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of opinion polls, inaudible rest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Just like Reagan</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Romney also promised military striking on Iran if sanctions fail to stop the nuclear programme.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he bragged."</seg>
<seg id="15">"If Obama is reelected, they will have the bomb."</seg>
<seg id="16">He also promised to augment the military assistant to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations in relation to this partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The businessman Herman Cain, second candidate best put, shows as for him an embarrassing ignorance of files.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, he called to counter military Chinese threat because Beijing "tries to develop a nuclear capacity" - obviously ignorant due to the fact that China keeps the military atom since 1964!</seg>
<seg id="19">The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants striking against Iran, claims to be ready, as for him, to hire the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appeal in torture against the supposed terrorists, forbidden by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are far from the republican candidate of 2008, JOHN MCCAIN, heavyweights in foreign policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The adversaries of the current president retort that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won Cold War.</seg>
<seg id="23">They remind that Obama an amateur was himself and that he had to put some water in his wine in antiterrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">They stress justifiably the failure of its naive dialogue with Iran, the departure too much thrown by the "boys" of Iraq, its equivocation in Libya, gluing on it together so a tag of weak-willed person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But the attack isn't so easy.</seg>
<seg id="26">The population considers rather positive the balance sheet of national security of Obama, who eliminated Ben Laden.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Iraq, she is wary of military interventions which drive to the sinking.</seg>

<seg id="1">The North Stream, new door of ntrée some Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The North gas pipeline Stream, linking up Western Europe directly in Russia by passing in the bottom of the Baltic Sea, entered service.</seg>
<seg id="3">He must give some gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate event with great pomp.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests among whom four leaders of State and of government participated, last Tuesday, on the edges of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and fine sideboard, in the unveiling of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline which links up directly, under the sea, Russia in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister François Fillon and her counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together stealing him from the valve ordering the entrance of the Russian gas in west-European network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new gas pipeline, 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of Russian gas are going to arrive every year in Western Europe by a first 1 224 km tube linking up the region of St. Petersburg at the Land de Mecklembourg-Poméranie.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube must be finished at the end of 2012, allowing to issue in total 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas, that is the equivalent of all French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">And they already recall the possibility of constructing a third on the same course.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the completion at the right time of this huge construction site has air of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Plan had been strongly questioned by Poland and Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">The North Stream is indeed going to allow to deliver some gas directly in Germany, by avoiding any passage of the Earth by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Suddenly, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to influence Russia by threatening to close it the access to the west-European markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of debate, Warsaw hadn't hesitated to compare the North Stream with a "new germano-Soviet pact", in reference to alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is to say if subject is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, by bringing its support of this Russian plan, earned it a higher security of its supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe energy, since plan created a hole between Eastern and Western Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia could, in five years barely, make triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western, strongly consumer countries of gas, and deposits of which are in decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">" This gas pipeline is an element of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which links us in an organic way", confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this gas pipeline, showing to what extent the big gas contracts are as political as economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All that explains broad grins shown by the leaders of Gazprom, gifts in numbers in Lubmin, so as to arrival of the gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The building of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.</seg>
<seg id="22">The underwater tube is steel sheathed by concrete to protect it against the anchors of ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">He is based on the bottom of the sea, in 200 m on average.</seg>
<seg id="24">To construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.</seg>
<seg id="25">" A hundred must be taken away or destroyed, by precaution", points out Jens Müller, spokesperson of the North society Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 turns Eiffel, whom nothing interrupts on all its length: neither valve, or station of service.</seg>
<seg id="28">A deck of control was envisaged off Sweden, but the representatives for plan abandoned it while the Swedes were not very eager to see a society of Russian State settling permanently off the coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">" In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than one minute", specifies Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In case of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes therefore in air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is considered unlikely by the constructors who envisaged soldering to know an escape every 100 000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The surveillance of the state of the gas pipeline is assured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus which circulates inside the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the form of a cigar, he is introduced inside the tube, one metre broad in diameter, and he is pushed by the gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">At arrival, after three complete days of trip at the speed of 3 metres back up, it delivers definite information on possible distortions of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The gas pipeline was conceived to work fifty years without credit to suffer the slightest repairing.</seg>
<seg id="36">The circulation of the gas is simply assured by pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is 200 bars at first, and 100 at arrival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five societies joined their force to accomplish this plan.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leader remains Gazprom, who keeps 51 % of parts.</seg>
<seg id="40">E.ON and BASF joined it German (15,5 % each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF group Sweat (9 % each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five societies created a North common, called firm Stream, made responsible for constructing and for operating on the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">She has her seat in Zoug, in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favourable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom then rented to this society, for twenty renewable years, the totality of the capacities of transport of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">" Gazprom will pay for the complete capacity, whatever is the quantity of gas indeed transported", specifies Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the building of the gas pipeline was assured 30 % by the shareholders and 70 % by banking loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of jobs should attain 7,4 thousand million euro for both tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Sweat the investment, for example, came to 240 millions.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are sure of coming back into their expenses, since only Gazprom takes risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The gas pipeline appears from the Baltic Sea to Lubmin, on sandy coastal region planted of pines.</seg>
<seg id="50">Valves, 4,5 metres high, form the exit of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas which arrives, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour which passes.</seg>
<seg id="53">In full capacity, these will be 3 millions an hour and in 2012, 6 millions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Imitation leather, a leading book.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian firm, Imitation leather wants to give again the taste of the writing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">He has a perfume of adventures, of the hours passed to write in the light of a candle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The book Imitation leather is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band not completely white, its leaves of a colour, as aged by time.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the book Imitation leather such as he is known today is born in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Italian Modo Modo firm, based in Milan, decides to throw a report card design but distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maria Sebregondi, then consulting for the firm, takes responsibility for the launching of the new product.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book draws inspiration from an ancient technology of production, skin (mole's skin) mole which indicates a cotton varnish used to cover wall seats for example.</seg>
<seg id="9">This type of book was very appraised of the writers and passengers.</seg>
<seg id="10">" Imitation leather delayed fashionable an object old and forgotten, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until XX e century", tells Maria Sebregondi, become since the representative for mark to Modo Modo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Success is there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010, sales augmented by 26 % to settle in 12,7 million past rooms.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are far from the confidential production of the first years, when only 3 000 books were conceived.</seg>
<seg id="14">Imitation leather exceeds Italian borders and is exported in 70 countries, of France up to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">Difficult to establish a photofit of the purchaser, because the report card entices as well the businessman as the student and the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just like Imitation leather, his consumers are cosmopolitan, opened of mind and cultivated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The Italian small enterprise, which counted 12 employees at its beginning, in count almost 100 today and refreshed since 2008 of two offices; the one in Milan and other one in New York.</seg>
<seg id="18">She distributes her books in bookshops, of Fnac to the small boutiques of city centre and could impose her identity.</seg>
<seg id="19">" We followed the air of time and this new need of writing, in spite of the development of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.</seg>
<seg id="20">This cultural signature accompanies the development of Imitation leather: recently, mark threw an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists display their own book.</seg>
<seg id="21">In August, she also threw a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Film festival of Locarno.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Using its success and this cultural aura, Imitation leather could diversify its products: bags, agenda, fountain pens, dust covers of computer... Mark declines on the whole range of support.</seg>
<seg id="23">A success which made envious: in autumn, 2006, Modo Modo was bought back by the fund of investment Key SG Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Imitation leather.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why does the unemployment rate of the handicapped workers remain so raised?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 19 % handicapped persons are in search of a job.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 15th week for the job of the disabled persons opens today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In spite of a voluntarist public policy set up in 2005, unemployment rate of the handicapped persons is still twice as high as average: 19 %, against 9 % for the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Discouraging?</seg>
<seg id="6">" No, underlines Éric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the association which organises the week for the job of the disabled persons."</seg>
<seg id="7">" Progress fulfilled for fifteen years is considerable."</seg>
<seg id="8">" At that time the unemployment rate wasn't two but three times as high."</seg>
<seg id="9">" It remains still tremendously nevertheless to make."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It is necessary to say that for the handicapped unemployed persons, obstacles remain many before achieving job.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are rather old: 37 % are more than 50 years old (17 % on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a not very high qualification level: 80 % have no receptacle and on 2,3 million students of higher education, 10 000 only are handicapped.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the long-term unemployment is very spread: 53 % for the disabled persons, against 38 % on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, so much criteria which complicate particularly the return to job, and that "constitute the knot of problem", according to Christian Grapin, managing director of Ski jump, an association created in 1992 to help firms to recruit handicapped workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Here is for the objective brakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">The unsaid, the mentalities stays which evolve, certainly, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study accomplished in April by the association IMS-ENTREPRENDRE for the City pointed out that the questioned managers have "a level of weak knowledge of disability", with a "overrepresentation of the persons in wheelchair, of deficient psychical or intellectual".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Result, the private business of more than 20 wage earners is still far from reaching the target of job of 6 % of handicapped workers, fixed in a law of... On 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last known figures, which date of 2008, mention a 2,6 % ratio.</seg>
<seg id="20">" We are now around 3 %", points out Pierre Blanc, managing director of Agefiph, organism made responsible for collecting the contributions of the firms which don't respect this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">Proof: the number of establishments "taxed ", just as poured sums, diminished between 2007 and 2011, passing 59 000 - 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 millions of euro).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">" The law of 2005, which augmented contributions, created a strong pressure on firms, explains Pierre Blanc."</seg>
<seg id="23">" But this improvement also translates a true realisation, especially in the big groups."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the ministry of job, only 59 % of establishments 20 - 49 wage earners use handicapped workers, against 82 % of firms 100 - 199 wage earners.</seg>

<seg id="7">Portugal is really only in 90 minutes happiness.</seg>
<seg id="8">But there is a match to play Bosnia, and an adversary, to unbolt.</seg>
<seg id="9">In view of the first leg (0-0), on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it apparait hollow out that games aren't made.</seg>
<seg id="10">Portugal dominated the part during more than one hour, certainly, but it was unable to score this such a precious goal, which would have relieved it.</seg>
