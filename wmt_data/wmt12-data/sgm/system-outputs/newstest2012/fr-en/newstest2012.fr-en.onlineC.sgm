</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It remains to determine the winners.</seg>
<seg id="5">As it is of custom in the region, the winners to the elections are the Islamists, but it is a matter of the moderate ones or of the radicals.</seg>
<seg id="6">The provisional National Advice has decreed the usual right of the Sharia and we know already what it is a matter of.</seg>

<seg id="10">In Libya règnera such an order as we can not imagine it and as we would not love surely.</seg>
<seg id="11">But our way of living is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be worthwhile for the Libyan ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is particularly astonishing that the Islamist warriors have accepted the help with gratitude of the unfaithful dogs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only one forgives it is that it is not an américian general that directed the touches of the NATO but rather Allah of which they celebrated the size to every attack.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">When it is therefore a matter of looking for the winners in Libya, the west is not part</seg>
<seg id="15">We have participated in the shootings, served the Islam and our poilitiques have turned away from the dictator as political ally without that not taking any benefit.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">More than one third of the children of 9 to 13 years have problems of excess weight, 9% of the écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese persons.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the present investigations show it the obese children come from families that have an unhealthy way of life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">That shows again to what point is important the environment in which the human being evolves and model them that surround it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the tables of the obese children one more often finds for example delicatessen 50% than in the families of children at the normal weight.</seg>
<seg id="6">19% of the obese persons had of the chips to the dinner according to the inquiry taken with an action of sensitization "the Obesity is not a chance"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In the families of the big small ones the sport is not also a habit, what is maintaining the case of most of the schoolboys of today - only 15% has replied that at least a time a week the parents found the time for of the movement active.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Inquiry taken on 900 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The inquiry has taken place for the last school year and have participated 900 students of the grade schools of Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was the second edition of "the Obesity is not a chance", action supported by the general Assurance of health and the Unilever society.</seg>
<seg id="11">  From the beginning they are more than 12000 students of sixth to the third that have registered themselves at this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">One of the decisive factors that cause a dramatic increase of the number of children in excess weight, indeed obese persons, is l'absence,d'une correct feeding and not enough physical exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Only half of the questioned children indicates for example to eat 5 times a small day to eat-in case - breakfast - snack- dinner, which is one principles of base of a good feeding", indicates one of the results of the inquiry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Without small breakfast and delicatessen at the dinner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The specialists attract the attention on the fact that to have a healthy development some details of base such as a small breakfast in family at the same hour are needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of the students eat to the my same hour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In the major part of the families each takes his small breakfast alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the worse that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not take at all small breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nevertheless the small breakfast is the base of a good daily feeding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The questionnaire has shown that in the families of the obese children one more often consumes unhealthy chips.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nearly every student - without talking about the weight - drinks every day of the drinks sweet (70%).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">More than 40% of the questioned children makes sport regularly but for the parents it is a matter of the half, only 15%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Prepare your feeding for you</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another part of the inquiry has allowed children selected (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare his own feeding from possibilities proposed according to their own taste and their personal opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"The preferences of the Czech children of 12 to 15 years are far, as regards a healthy feeding, of the ideal".</seg>
<seg id="26">Among their preferred dishes there are many cakes, the meats and the sugar refineries.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The most alarming is notably a great preference for the sweet lemonades", is advisable in the results of the inquiry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the breakfast it is the pastas that have taken the first fair place in front of the white meat.</seg>
<seg id="29">The children do not have at all wanted of starchy foods and the preference for the fish and the meals of vegetables was very weak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Cape on the health</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The inquiry has shown that the children are ready to change their habits from the moment that they receive the ad hoc information also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"In the course of a control of a group of participants to the inquiry that had filled the questionnaire after the session with sensitization "Obesity is not not a chance, one has assité to a well determined will of heading for a healthy feeding", indicate the results of the inquiry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The most marking has been for example for what concerns the sweet lemonades because the children have started giving preference to the water of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="34">The children have the most often ticked the white meat and the fish as main course on the questionnaire and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech spécialté of meatballs of flour of bread or of potatoes).</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The stylist must be also a good psychologist, say the professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In an article of relative presentation to the way of learning for the stylists, I have gotten myself a little bit angry of the fact that there were a lot from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="3">I did not think about what was going to happen thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="4">The accounts of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what happens on site.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">More we approach to the final examinations and more wait for us of the practical exercises and of the information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even when there are lessons the Saturdays and Sundays it "truly is stuffed".</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we do not have with the manager Alenka (at the lesson there is not any boy) treated as the way of dressing the woman who does not have switchboard mensurations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And of the women of this type it is the majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">One has a small neck, the other one a body of boy, without particular curve, another of the excess weight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The stylist must know how optiquement ammenuiser of the wide arms, to prolong a neck or to add well necessary curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We have managed thus to underline the character nicely and also not to dress way too much seeing types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and of the pronounced hips and an exhaustive size.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If there is for example a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or the pants do not pass tout,cela is the blow of making it itself to make sur mesure worth.</seg>
<seg id="14">And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls perfectly is inestimable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In a skirt on measure you will feel a lot better than in the one that slips permanently, winds and does not stem from the belt and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For those that have a male appearance have can to allow a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of stitching tissues, or well still of the embroideries, to itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are many examples of 'diverse appearances' evidently 'and I am happy that I have the whole week to sort all the received information.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I have also fear that had consideration to it that I must make at home some is too much.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Every trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">We must take the present appearance, the type of fashion of the personality as his appearance, in consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I will owe "habiller"Miranda Kerr, which maybe you know the Secret of Victoria of the campaign.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">To the bottom of me, that makes pleasure to me, because it is better to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera that has not taken nearly a hundred kilos lately (do not take my declaration, svp, completely seriously) or well the young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">We must cut and sew from the magazines or look on internet, print and work the graphics.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Moodboard,comme one says for the final result, expresses our personal style as our relationship with the graphic creation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">To think also about the graphic part of the styling is also important.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stylist does not dress thus only the appearance but she creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on products given the tendencies for the handbags, the coats, etc...).</seg>
<seg id="27">Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, us has kept of all that.</seg>
<seg id="28">But that... until the Sunday</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The stylist must have a general vision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Three guests of the specialty have given a diversified aspect to the session of Saturday filled with information on the different types of characters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of fashion and Ben Renc, photographer of way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub has reminded us that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know to use it.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a stylist of talent knows to work only with one clothing in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="34">The variability is for this primordial example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As for example this trench-coat that is owed of being carried in a classical way with some jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also he can dress also the naked body, with low-fronted shoes and to take a picture of it as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or well it suffices going back the sleeves or the collar and having a new look immediately.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Play with cela"a-you him underlined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But I have particularly appreciated the next advice: "For the work you need to experience the rules perfectly".</seg>
<seg id="39">"Afterwards you can start contravening to it", has said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally I understand why one endeavors to learn these rules, that to make with, to which, why, even though in the magazines of fashion one sees sometimes something of other.</seg>
<seg id="41">No declaration on the processions of way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I know again, thanks to the photographer of way Ben that the stylist must have many more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.</seg>
<seg id="43">That is to say for fashion story that will have ten pages (therefore ten models) I must be ready to in "retailler"au minus a fortnight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also, a clothing and his combination with other elements appear completely differently that in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">We must reckon with that in the course of a creation of a model.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The fact that the picture and the style make sometimes the half of the succés has been confirmed us by Honza Pokorny.</seg>
<seg id="47">Concerning Madonna who is not a super singer suffices but his picture and the marketing have made a star mondiale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of the stylists remains still shivery.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the well known faces consider them sometimes as useless (it suffices that I know something but what I adorned pass to the second row).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if somebody is made make a styling of our part, we must count afterwards on the fact that it dictates us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one that it has in reality.</seg>
<seg id="51">He remains us afterwards that to to sail on google and to check if the infos of boulevard state the celebrity in question, if she has lost weight or she has put on weight etc...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Honza and Mario have put Sunday on the heart that 'it does not suffice to the stylist to direct oneself in the fashion and to know to assemble models' to us.</seg>
<seg id="53">It must communicate with the people that he dresses and being a good psychologist is thus important.</seg>
<seg id="54">Knowing to guess the people, not to flatter oneself, to preserve his opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"When one manager you asks of to sort it his cupboard and to fill it of new elements everything you can not throw and it dire,Mon God what horror."</seg>
<seg id="56">"You will find whatever businesses that you will find pretty and it that you will recommend with what to carry them", said Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">This has shown us concretely what everything must contain what one calls the "placovka"ou bag of the stylist.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is the one that you catch around the size and that you have on themselves as all what you need.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Beside the things clearly defined as the scissors, the rolls for depilation or well still the pins to babysitter, one finds also of the thread of nylon (that the stylist uses to photograph products as bags, or many hats), of the special clips with which one closes a clothing in the back, if it is too much big (the pin or other type of staple are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or well a kit of sewing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">So that us soyions not only of the people that listen but that have tried something in a practical way they have taught to us how ressemeller correctly of the shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">And in the course of the photo session in the workroom where the surface is equal, the sole could become damaged, at fortiori at lextérieur.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And thus we have stuck and stuck.</seg>
<seg id="63">We did not have the right to touch the scissors not to hurt itself by inadvertence.</seg>
<seg id="64">Abilities are truly needed therefore.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario has made me pleasure while he has congratulated me for my creation.</seg>
<seg id="66">The comptence that I state is not for my friend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only a small summary of what we have learned in the course of the second weekend of lesson</seg>
<seg id="68">I begin more and more to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, which each says what he wants.</seg>

<seg id="22">For example in the desert you find in one sandstorm that reduces you in a sensitive way the visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then in the mountains you must mind what an avalanche does not fall you above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Beside that the different races are well put together ones behind the others.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is only a small number only but that suffices.</seg>
<seg id="26">Him there of the instants you endeavor of surpassing the number asked for of adversaries (as in a classical race) then you will run against the watch (classical dual with the stopwatch) and then still you waits another dual with an adversary.</seg>
<seg id="27">From time to time you also have the police that enter to the game and that try to give you back the dificile situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The novelty are the passages apart from vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is a matter rather d'una interactive animation when most of the Jack time escapes in front of somebody and you must help it hitting on the good button at the good moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">What is amazing it is that there are less moments of this type than what you wait for (to be concrete there are only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">To the result it is well like that because this element does not risk to bother and is placed, in the context described above, to the elements that brighten up the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model of behavior is in the tradition of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="34">What means that presently it is not nothing extraordinary but one can not say that it is negative.</seg>
<seg id="35">For what concerns the realistic simulation you will have to go to see elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But although one can find better in the conccurrence the model of behavior is very fine with the type of conception of the races.</seg>
<seg id="37">Therefore everything is ok.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The problems start appearing after some time.</seg>
<seg id="39">At the diffférence of the model of behavior, that of the collisions is not at the point yet.</seg>
<seg id="40">We do not wait of this game for a complicated distortion and of the collisions, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the lesser one conceptualizes way in which comprises your car, it is not therefore completely good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the course of the tight overtakings you touch yourself sometimes mutually lightly but otherwise your car part in mad acrobatics.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or well finds in crumbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system of resurgence that is not really a problem but that really annoys you.</seg>
<seg id="44">The resurgence is made in order to what while you have broken yourself the face or have taken out the game in the setting brings you back at the moment of the last point on the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">But you have only 5 resurgences only.</seg>
<seg id="46">When you have used the 5 resurgences you must start the game again from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is therefore more a tool, for the case where something does not happen as him faut,que quelquechose on which truly you can count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes the resurgences do not help and the solution must be found in him remémorrant of dissertation the piece of route in question.</seg>
<seg id="49">The great hic of this game it is that the same actions meet themselves in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">For example there are some bends which it is needed to pass of one some way otherwise that does not pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Otherwise you meet on a given place vehicles "civils"toujours in the same shape that you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds early or a minute late.</seg>
<seg id="52">What gets angry it is the situations while you see go by easily the adversary between two cars coming in opposite sense and when you arrive, you, you are needed is to be left aside and the conturner or well to brake.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is equal if you go ahead of it because it is "such calculé"de way that for the given situation it arrives always close at hand of your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The adversaries have still other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="55">For all the time of the game, you, you arrive to some places, again without caring about the time, and you have always the same adversary who precedes you to the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">That irritates the most in end of game while you roll on a long bridge in opposite sense.</seg>
<seg id="57">The adversary owes at all costs to pass in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it goes by in front of you he conceals the sight of the other vehicles from you in opposite sense and you collide a good number of times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">One can understand that the goal of this game is of making gripping something and full d'adrédaline,mais it is light that you are bored rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is shame because through a model of simple behavior the game is interesting and the places with so much of action that you do not have time of following all what happens.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that it does not have any luck as it to be bored or well about thing of other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The original idea is the change of car in the course of the races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must mind the gas pumps on the routes because you can change most of the time for it of car however the one that you have you suffices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports cars are ideal for the cities, the American rolled engrossments for the right motorways and the super sports cars to the exotic attires on the very technical behaviors for example on the roads in lace in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">And the way of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know adventure, is very fine with the main system of the history.</seg>
<seg id="67">You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to the challenges and to the adventure.</seg>
<seg id="68">When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects start being unbolted:</seg>
<seg id="69">This connects itself on-line with the duty Autolog that among others compares your obtained results with those of other players and obtain for you other duties in the community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the blows most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.</seg>
<seg id="71">You arrive with your car to the tunnel of the subway (that looks) where you roll in the darkness on the ways (that looks).</seg>
<seg id="72">Your indicator of speed indicates you between 150 and 200 km/hour (to priori) and behind you arrives an oar of subway that sends you transports it directly to the scrap.</seg>
<seg id="73">That is to say to the writing we have had a discussion for some days if somebody has really thought during the creation of this game or well if the authors really catch us for fools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical part of the game is not visual extra,mais the part is as a rule pleasant and in some cases really high-octane gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="75">What bothers it is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not keep the level and in some cases of tragic way.</seg>
<seg id="76">That concerns especially the accidents with a great number of participants when you do not use a fluid imagery to anything anymore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The part sound is good and the track is to the choice.</seg>
<seg id="78">With the aim of pleasing the public teenager to the greatest number and particularly the more a new track sound has been created in the style "I mix all", but one can expect what nobody will buy the game for the music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">General impression of Need heart Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game did not have those stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is a matter of the best production of NFS these last years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But this game gives the impression not to be finished.</seg>
<seg id="82">The amusement is really well but prepare you for what the mistakes slap you in the eyes with the strength of a reflector of aerodrome.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Vicenova, Ambassadress to the européeenne Union:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs behave as négativistes and euro-skeptic ones</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The Lisbon treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"</seg>
<seg id="4">"I did not expect a so hard war".</seg>
<seg id="5">"That will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and that all the players get used to their new role", it is as Miléna Vicenova has begun his account at the Faculty of Czech Right the ambassadress to the European Union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When it has succeeded in describing the different organs of the EU and their relationships in way if comprehensible and visible, so much so that a great number of speakers of the faculty of Right of the University Charles could envy it, it has shown to what point she takes his "comprehensible" motto "and openly about Europe" very seriously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Madam Vicenova has paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Advice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"From the beginning resonated the criticisms that it is tasteless, who he is a penpusher, that it can not rempplir no mission and I must tell that it has cut the breath to everybody because it keeps his role to the perfection".</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is" a man "that knows to listen 27 member states, well to communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take" "of Europe".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It has explained the new post of the High representative for the foreign businesses and the policy of defense within the framework of a reply to the question: "That is that in the European Union?" "To what telephone number I must call"? therefore as an important step to the uniqueness and a greater legibility of the policy of the Union in view of the states, as is China or well India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (cheese to cooked pastry that feels very strong)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Madam Vicenova has stated also the agenda that has lived, lives and lives in a close time the European Advice.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has described the Czech presidency of two years ago as succés.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czech ones have solved the rising financial crisis, the crisis of the gas or well have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has described the fall as the gourvernement of very negative and has damaged the picture of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU is at the moment very busy.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the words of Madam the Ambassadress, "the activity has beaten his plein"non only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues decide still now.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is needed to approve besides of the new septimal budget of the Union that becomes very complicated because of the present economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As it would seem that the budget will be thin and with a view to economics, what branch will have the priority, what countries will be helped the more, the less, everything is to be solved within the framework of the future negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Madam the Ambassadress has reminded his slogans with which it has happened in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".</seg>
<seg id="21">"I do not like really the abbreviations, the foreign words, the gibberish that nobody understands.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels nobody makes gherkins round or crooked, of the great differemment bananas or well that nobody has us banned to make syrecky".</seg>
<seg id="23">She wants to use better the environment of the EU and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">A Europe to several speeds waits for us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the Ambassadress the Czechs have the reputation of being euro-skeptic ones and people who see the things only in their negative aspect more than positively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore it is sorry for seeing a so small representation Czech in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The mistake results, according to it, from several factors, as for example the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support of the Czech part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Beside a Czech presidency at succés it has underlined the strength and the cooperation of the group of Visegrad afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Believe me, when come to me the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French calls me: 'Hé, that estce that you make over there, that is still this group of Visegrad?"et it is not at all happy'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">According to Madam Vicenova, in a close future they are new hard rules as regards budget policy that wait for the member countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is the concept of a Europe to two speeds, if it is not to several speeds, who prevails rather than a "new European Federation".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have countries in the euro zone and of others out of the zone."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the space Schengen, we have also the institute of reinforced cooperation".</seg>
<seg id="34">In first place it was said that cooperate among them the countries that want it and those that do not want it remain in their corner."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Many institutes of this type will be and a Europe will be really to two speeds", expects Madam Vicenova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Of this viewpoint also she has appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye of determining the bases according to which all the themes having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not only the memebres of the eurozone.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">History of a brand:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovator IBM begins the second century of his existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If anybody had to look for the term that expresses to the more to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".</seg>
<seg id="4">For a wide IBM public is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very present and however for his creation it has gone by a hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The base of this strategy in the long term has been thrown by the first leader of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has left this slogan that a great number of world problems can be settled for little that the people are anxious to think.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan "PENSE'!"est become the imprint around which is going to develop the life of a gigantic future (and also the title of the magazine interns that IBM started editing in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">It was the base of the culture of the soignement firm elaborated by Watson.</seg>
<seg id="9">For us IBM means a thought in the long term of continuous movements directed towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the made one that it remained always faithful to his values of base and however has not been afraid of changing all the others around it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That has allowed us in the course of our first century to transform the technology, the business and the society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second century we will affect still plus"a délaré for the birthday the present manager of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A well prepared system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, in the years thirty, started to take care of his employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have the paid vacations, one assurance paid by the employer more a uniform of elegant employee and a well elaborated system of rewards for the inventors and the commmerciaux.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the same IBM way has a sytème of relationships with the well elaborated customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The society was initially inspired in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished every form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.</seg>
<seg id="17">The present plan is completely in the mind of the anti-discriminatory strategy since she will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - that should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="18">This works by IBM for thirty years and occupies presently the post of Sales Manager, Marketing and of the Strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in the course of the last years is what one calls of the jamy, of the brain- online storming from which stem much of future strategies and of the innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is not astonishing that it has many ideas - in the firm it is close to 500000 people who work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is the internal and external picture of the firm that assures him a sure position in the domains of the businesses.</seg>
<seg id="23">"From the IBM beginning had a concept rather of institution that of a technological firm", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Teacher of economics to the School of economics of Harvard and author of the book on IBM.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technlogique firm but a firm that helps people of the business to solve problems using his technology", added Geogre Colony of the firm of Consulting Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the firm itself says it there is a difference between to enter on the market and to create this market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or well the "Med", as it is called familiarly in the United States had consideration to his slogan- in a hundred years it has grown up to becoming one of the greatest world firms.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is evidently the most polyvalent technological firm - it develops software, of the hardwares, infrastructure, lodging, services of Advice at the level of the products of the waiter up to the nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">It possesses numerous diplomas of all the American technological firms and five of his employees have received a price Nobel.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among his discoveries lines up for example the distributor of tickets, the debit card, the financial swap, the bar code or well the diskette.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM has met itself this year with 220 billion dollars the second greater technological firm according to the capitalization of the market (the first is Apple), when for the first time it overtook in 1996 Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Seen early</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">They are not all the innovations and fabrications that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example has not completed the bet on an own operational system OS/2, of the online Prodigy service or a lot of IBM computer PCjr:</seg>
<seg id="33">"From the moment where your business is built on the movement early you can not not émotionellement to remain caught on the past," made to notice Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">For that IBM does not have not of problem to build his bases on many plate armors-forms and when they do not work she goes away.</seg>
<seg id="35">To the difference for example of the conccurent Microsoft that to the base is held and is under the operational system Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">A perspective technology</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the incomes IBM, the services, which are formed for one fifth by the software and hardwares, have a predominant place.</seg>
<seg id="38">However still in 1990 it was with more of the motié of participation the strongest representative of hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">From the year 2000 IBM has sold of the active ones to weak yield for 15 billion dollars, in the course of cettre period it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of perspective technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first leader Thomas J. Watson, who in the course of the great economic crisis has also increased his volume of investments.</seg>
<seg id="42">Him apparait henceforth that IBM pass the present crisis without being worried?</seg>
<seg id="43">The price of the IBM action has progessé from 2008 in rocket of 120 pourcent, the net profit of the firm continues grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The logo of the IBM firm is of changing everything but not his values.</seg>
<seg id="45">One can expect for that to it that this flexible giant maitrise of other crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">History of IBM: From the slices of cheeses up to the flights in the cosmos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The IBM society (International Business Machines) has been born in New York it is a hundred years; it had initially the name complicated from Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">She took the IBM name in 1924 - initially it was a matter of a brand used by a branch of a firm at Canada and in South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The base of the future IBM has been the fusion of four firms whose history is related to the year 80 of the ten ninth century.</seg>
<seg id="50">They possessed technologies as for example the previous "checkers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and the departure of the employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new society was Charles Ranlett Flint that up to in 1930 presided over the Advice of Surveillance of the society.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint hired the leader of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help him to lead the society.</seg>
<seg id="53">The leader made afterwards shade to the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that rest until now the identity and the culture of the society.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the kusqu firm in 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM,comme calls it his name, began with the production all possible machines for the businesses and the business - of the trancheuses of cheeses and of meat up to to the cash registers.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the course of the four first years during which Watson led, the turnover multiplied up to reaching 9 million dollars and began the expansion of the firm in all the parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of direction it is his son who occupied the armchair of manager, Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his IBM direction the development of the artificial intelligence began and developed the first language of programming.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the years 60 the people and the computers of IBM helped NASA has to guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturne and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.</seg>
<seg id="60">Between time in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.</seg>
<seg id="61">The classical PC that determined the switchboard of computer of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the one walked in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later IBM sells his factory of computers to the Chinese society Lenovo, but bought the society of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and started taking care of advice and services with a high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy that succeeds at IBM these three last years - the concept Smarter Planet "a more intelligent planet" is.</seg>
<seg id="64">His objective is the intelligent uilisation of the technology in domains not yet exploited as for example the transport and the management of the cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">With regard to the domain of the IBM business has developed little time ago a platform "Smarter Commerce"qui help the commercial ones to manage the whole commercial cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a strong history also on our territory.</seg>
<seg id="67">It created his branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first country of central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, beside IBM RT, there is also the strategic center of outsourcing of Brno.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Central one for the Central Europe and Eastern sits in Prague and there is also the team of research and development of the world level that takes care of the gratitude of the word.</seg>

<seg id="1">The worst vices of the women: Does that also concern you?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">If you ask the men to determine typical vices of the women, everyone, ones as the others, are capable of taking them out "of their sleeve".</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear ladies, you are going to know in the next lines feminine vices that happen to pump the blood of the veins of the men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The purchases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Your half makes you of the remarks that you are dependent on the purchases?</seg>
<seg id="6">Owe to you you buy at least one clothing a week?</seg>
<seg id="7">You are happy to buy and by packets at the moment of the sales?</seg>
<seg id="8">In your case one can talk about the purchases as one vice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Some women think that they should restrict their passion of making purchases.</seg>
<seg id="10">But you will say, which would resist the window-shopping of the stores of clothes, to look for himself for pretty clothes and afterwards to try them everyone in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">And although for most of the women buying is a hobby, that can become a real hell for the man.</seg>
<seg id="12">You remind only how much of time have you says to your spouse that it waits for to the entry...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Constant dissatisfaction</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Am I not big too much"?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I would need to lose weight to the less than 5 kilos - I should start making sport?"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Do I please you"?</seg>
<seg id="17">These sentences do not remind you something?</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes?</seg>
<seg id="19">You are therefore part of these women who are obsessed by their appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a great number of men is allergic by the way that their partner is complaining always about his appearance.</seg>
<seg id="21">The strong sex does not hesitate to say that more the frequency of these complaints increases and more the women become poisoning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The odre and the cleanliness at the first place</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It is as an infinite roundabout.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washing window them, to hoover, to clean the grounds, to make the dust, to strip the bathroom - and that two times a week.</seg>
<seg id="25">You make specificity, to the children that they have dirtied the washbasin, clogged the window of the living room, and that that gives you a lot of work, remarks to your partner that it walks with dirty feet on the ground?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">If you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to have to the mind that it is not needed to exaggerate anything and that the order and the cleanliness must not be to the first place in the family.</seg>
<seg id="27">This inoffensive desire for cleanliness can waste your relationships and even the family peace though.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The work of sapping</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Puts this worn tracksuit to the garbage can".</seg>
<seg id="30">"You intend to put these old socks still tomorrow"?</seg>
<seg id="31">"A wet serviette does not have anything to make by earth".</seg>
<seg id="32">If you do this work of sapping on your partner in this way several times a day, you are really going to split it up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It is evident that you do not think to badly you want that everything is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">Maybe that if the men knew it ,les women would not have to do so much work of sapping...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The slandering, the mockery</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The slandering, the mockery but also the insults against somebody are also the specificity of some women.</seg>
<seg id="37">The women are carried particularly to the relationships and thus are happy to deal with the subjects as whom, where, with whom, how and why.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Maybe that each of us lets escape a small inoffensive mockery ici et là.</seg>
<seg id="39">The hand on the heart it is nevertheless a particularity of the women.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the worse are those that recommend, mock, even scorn the other and are for their environment - particularly to the work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How have the prices of the journeys for 1989 evolved</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Up to in 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 agencies of journey of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The agencies of journey at this time proposed journeys especially in the countries of the socialist block, because the journeys westwards were very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Czech tourists traveled for the vacations in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Sea Noire), in Bulgaria, Romania (the two in Sea Noire) and in Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A great exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to by traveling in Yugoslavia then the system started having an inclination as the west and the journeys to Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The great paradox of the socialist time was that him nétait not authorized for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechs) of traveling individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the case where the Czech citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or in Soviet Union it needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual journey was not authorized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The agencies of journey at this time offered also journeys westwards however it was needed to queue all night with a sleeping bag or well to have a "domestic connaissance"au breast of the agency of journey.</seg>
<seg id="9">And even after that it was not yet earned.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agreement for the currencies that was the condition to travel westwards was refused to the people "politically incorrects"qui could not at all to travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czech currency was not though exchangeable and obtaining financial means without the agreement from currencies (western currency) to travel westwards was not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Czechs spent the most often their vacations in the country where consequently it was of numerous country houses and chalets that the Czechs were bought themselves and this habit lasts until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The journeys of the Czechs have for known for 1989 a great revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Although up to in 1989 the vacations in East Germany and Bulgaria belonged to the maximum,les Czechs have passed the last year abroad 4 million days of vacations in the countries of the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The great paradox of which we do not have conscience today it is that the most popular country is the Croatia where it was not possible to go freely up to in 1989 because part of the Yugoslavia of the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The suppression visas in the years 90 of the last century in the countries neighboring of the west have caused an enormous wave of visits of short duration especially in Austria to Vienna and in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czechs could not during long traveling by airplane westwards that each wanted to see at least one instant.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example in Paris the organizations of journeys made the Czechs in tents in the parks sleep because our incomes did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The typical feature of a journey of Czechs was at this time of taking his own food with themselves preserves, salami, etc... to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important instant has been also the interchangeability of the Czech crown that has allowed our tourists finally after tens of years of being able freely to buy of the western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living as the average salary have increased what has caused around the year 1997 another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to an increasing request for the journeys the travel agencies have begun for 1997 to prepare towers with links by aerial charter planes that thanks to contracts have tremendously reduced the costs in relation to what was before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the years 90 of the last century the Czechs had links without visas virtually with most of the countries developed of the whole world apart from the ones HAD that later have facilitated our journeys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another moment interesting Thailand in the history of the post-revolution tourism, when the first aerial charter plane was prepared to an exotic country, from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="25">For this year as every year of the direct aerial charter planes take of the Czech tourists in the distant warm countries; this winter 12 exotic destinations will be from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is more than 100000 Czechs that visit the exotic countries every year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Still a moment interesting in this period who symbolizes our post-revolution development has happened in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">on November 17th, 2008 the ones HAD have removed the visas for the Czech tourists and has allowed to our country ordering itself developed countries completely in the group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in the history have passed more of the half of their vacations abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time still in the history have spent more than 15 000 crowns per nobody for vacations abroad including the subsidiary loads. Crowns per nobody.</seg>

<seg id="1">The general assembly must find his President but that risks to end with a situation without solution "a stalemate"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Close to 5mois already the Czech football is without President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of the Football of the Czech Republic yet is not known after still a general Assembly that must take place Thursday to Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Though it does not exist always agreed according to what regulations of vote one must proceed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without this agreement starting voting for one of the three candidates is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested by the direction of the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hasek has given his resignation in June and in the course of his departure has called his colleagues has to unite and to take on a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only for the era after Hasek the football has come back backward to divergences between the bedrooms of the Association that can not be put agreed on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">That has completely shown to itself on September 16th while a new president must be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of the general Assembly have met uselessly in the national House in Prague because the negotiation has remained blocked and has not even been question of dealing with the way of electing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Him not there not had agreed on the fact of knowing that has the right to vote for the general Assembly - only ,semble-you him, the statutory representatives or well also the officials invested with full powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this unique point there has been a partial agreement for this instant with the help also of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the fullness to be able is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">The divergences continue always about the regulations for the election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is too much light that the executive committee, that in her negotiation planned or extraordinary, anything has not brought either to the situation</seg>
<seg id="14">The opinions about the possibilitě of vote have changed several times but the neuralgic point is always the same one.</seg>
<seg id="15">The east question: how to proceed for the third turn not to fall in the stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The apple of discord resides in the next fact: is to proceed according to the statutes or well to find another modèle",constatait one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents the football professional within the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the rules of the predicted model win at the third turn that of the candidates that will have received the biggest voice in percentage within the bedroom for which he is a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is ready according to what one says to retire so that the candidate wins who will have received the greatest percentage of voice of the two bedrooms.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Czech part studies the condition that the winner should have the two thirds at least of the percentages of voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Only that it would make to lose afterwards the idea of two precedent towers and that it would make to refuse completely the bicameral concept", admits Svoboda that includes the objections of the morave part and according to whom the best would be of not changing the regulations and voting according to the statutes in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is amazing that Tomas Paclik is as agreed same if he considers that the regulations of the elections established according to the statutes favor the more Pelta among all the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I hope that one votes to the maximum according to the statutes of the association".</seg>
<seg id="23">"So that it is not still of preposterous ideas imagined by a representative as in the course of the passed general Assemblies", has declared the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and that in his accounts has defined itself especially against Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to it to Nymburk a new President will be and believes that the coopèreront candidates in the future unity and in a constructive way.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible qualification today in Championship of Europe should calm everybody".</seg>
<seg id="27">"The football will be again on a wave of happiness and him there aure more spirit for a coopération"ajoute the officer of Jablonec that among the three has the greatest experience as regards direction of the football professional as well as at the regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tight".</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want changing the regulations to drawing".</seg>
<seg id="31">"That can cause again a blocking to the Assemblé general".</seg>
<seg id="32">I hope for everything as the healthy reason gagnera"a said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It does not remain a lot of time for a common agreement at all the parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but that can say if the whole direction of the football will be complete for the match.</seg>
<seg id="35">The especially chartered flight in which had to travel up to Podgorice among others the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not taken off for technical reasons and one looked for a variant to carry a part of the executive committee on the ground of the retaliations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, that should be decisive.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Minister of the education of the youth and of the sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parts torn within the strongest sport association of the country and to lead them an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the game there are a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of the football and also the general Assembly of the Czech Union of the Sports that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclik goes away to the fighting for the post of President because he does not see any candidate correct.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the general Assembly whose profile would have replied football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) to all what he asks for for a new President of the Association it would not be taken in campaign for this high duty.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If such a candidate exists I support it, I fight for it and I do not appear to the election."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the present situation finding such a declared candidat",a Paclik to the Czech press agency (CTK) has not been possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The motivation of Paclik is of entering in competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl for precisely to try to prevent Pelta of reaching at the head of the AFRT that to priori would be given favorite for this election.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclik underlines also that if it took away the elections it would keep this post of President only up to in 2013 year foreseen for a general Assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He would see well in the duty an experienced manager and of high level but who is not related with the world of the football.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I have discussed with people who would have the profil",dit-him.</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me that has been terrible while some have told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="48">"I would love to make this picture change", it has added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">It that, one says, bothers especially Paclik, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the regional Union of the football of Plzen Roman Berbr, man to the counterpaid fame that is known backstage as lobbyiste capable of influencing on the vote of the delegated ones 'the Assemblé general.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclik it is not satisfactory that Pelta occupies this position of President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"If it won, the present state would remain and nothing would be again in the football."</seg>
<seg id="52">"And with the support of Berbr, who is a storekeeper of high flight, that would be still less favorable to the football",a declared Paclik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">It that shocks it still it is the fact that the name of Pelta has been pronounced him there some years in the course of listenings within the framework of an inquiry on a business of corruption, for which Pelta has put through without any grief.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what prestige Pelta would bring to the football."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And how we would have considered to the eyes of the UEFA and of the FIFA"dit Paclik, which declared some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">In the case where Paclik would triumph to the vote over Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rajchl, another candidate that had been pressed by Paclik before the general Assembly of September that had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"Him (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go".</seg>
<seg id="59">"It has great capacities"</seg>
<seg id="60">"Appearing for example as leader of the representation would be capable".</seg>
<seg id="61">"But as manager of the Association it would not be capable."</seg>
<seg id="62">I do not put the nose in what I do not know pas",indique Paclik that in September has attracted a great attention when it has pronounced itself in favour of the annulation of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela that Dagmar Damkova has replaced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclik maintains that it would be at the level to lead the Association.</seg>
<seg id="64">He takes as example his capacities to lead private firms and that it leads also for the last year the club of Plzen that has celebrated with his support in last May his triumph in first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the strength to make something change in the world of the sport and to bring some culture".</seg>
<seg id="66">"I would brake the influence of some concerned groups that have for example tendency to influence on the disciplinary Commission and of call, what leads to situations of bad taste," has added Paclik that not chache not his antipathy for the leader of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">He would envisage also a harmonization of the relationships with the Czech Olympic Committee of which the power of lobby next to the policies of high level would allow obtaining more money for the sport from the tax on the games.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It is one of the key points whose new President should be occupied".</seg>
<seg id="69">"If it is a matter of the tax on the games of chance as the political parties declare it, I understand their argumentations but also they should say where the money goes", it has declared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paclik does not take his present link with the club of Plzen as something of negative even if himself maintains that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties".</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is again related with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not the ideal".</seg>
<seg id="73">I do not see reason of passing on my actions of the club of Plzen to somebody if I must come back a year and a half after", has declared Paclik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to the situations of stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidate for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if it is taken up, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels about the regulations for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="76">The official of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday to very optimistic Nymburk and thinks that the succés today the representation of football should calm this guéguerre before the vote.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="81">it is also for that that it consumes itself enough with experiences to lead the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced of behind the topical problems with the election finding itself a euphory that reigned to lépoque of Ivan Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately to general l"Assemblé of June statutes have been approved of that were not perfect as everyone have noticed it".</seg>
<seg id="84">"If there were not all these diverse interprétattions we would already have had a President for septembre",souligne Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It is precisely the review of the most important document of the civic association that has taken all the attention of the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I become President, I take it as personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in the case where that does not work".</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a principle without which we can not exist", has added Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Afterwards he endeavors, one says, of not confronting itself to his adversaries.</seg>
<seg id="89">He has declared previously that it can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that him reconnait had consideration to his training in right and that he knows pertinently that his adversary-candidate would be his first Vice-President.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="91">"It evolves in the football for a year and has already had some succés."</seg>
<seg id="92">"His attacks were not however most honorable and has surprised numerous people in the course of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"It is also as that that some have now doubts on his character", has declared Pelta to the address of his adversary but remains, it says, faithful to the proclamations that it has made in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His strongest weapon is his knowledge of the football from the competitions of the lowest level up to the national réprésentation according to it.</seg>
<seg id="95">It should be a vitirne of the football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"And I would endeavor also to finish all the businesses that begin with that of the Bohémians or well the continuation of the scandal of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="97">"I would enter immediately in negotiations with the sector public and deprived so that we can obtain enough from money for all the football ", had declared to the Czech press agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.</seg>

<seg id="99">"I should meet all the employees", he has declared to Strahov where a comprehensible reigns nervousness for that him not there not of direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Although catastrophic scripts foreseen with the general Assembly are, he thinks that the delegates will not go at Nymburk for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If there is only one point of discord on the way of voting for the third turn we will manage to surpass it".</seg>
<seg id="102">"The football needs credibility and it will not obtain it that while it will be to his head one new leader",comme declares it in an optimistic way Pelta two days before the probably decisive day for his career of official.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would start working hard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">"If the Vice-President present Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic to general l"Assemblée of Thursday that would not enjoy not to a great number of people, it adorned.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises though that in the case where it would be taken up one will start working hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants systemic changes and to give back the members of the Executive Committee is persons in charge of the different domains of the football.</seg>
<seg id="107">He has promised also to settle the business Bohémians, to improve the relationships with the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to the football and to continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As President I want to take care of the football in his integer".</seg>
<seg id="109">"International contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA through the national representation, of the professional football and of an efficient football for the youth."</seg>
<seg id="110">"But I do not say that I will make all that said seul"a Rajchl in a maintenance for CTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a player of team and want to distribute the abilities within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a determined domain."</seg>
<seg id="112">"And I will distribute difficult missions so that the great football face one not forward".</seg>
<seg id="113">"Many" people will not be happy because it will be a matter of starting working hard rather than of criticizing the autres"a-you him added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">He has stated, one says, that it would not imagine as candidate because of an atmosphere criticizes.</seg>
<seg id="115">"About me, one knows that I work 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"but I need to know if that is the blow worth and if I will have people behind me who will put me constantly sticks in the wheels and will express doubts on each of the my actions", explaining why he hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">"Many people have all the same told me that I must not renounce because they would also renounce".</seg>
<seg id="118">"Cest a trust that I can not betray, it says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">What motivates it, one says, is also of continuing the work begun with Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="120">"For those two last years it has been a great de facto work and I do not want to let it fall".</seg>
<seg id="121">"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in some years and I would not love that somebody stops them., it has declared with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not come back as it was before Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in a systematic work and it is a thing which Mirek Pelta does not know to make".</seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind it find himself of the people that fairaient of the football in such a way that it would be only for those that" have been "chosen".</seg>
<seg id="124">"One can reproach to me for some number of things but surely not of quelq supporter one".</seg>
<seg id="125">"I endeavor to be objective".</seg>
<seg id="126">"I want to make football for everyone because everybody will be happy not only those that have been chosen</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">And it confirms again that he would be only a President for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="128">"And if any that say the opposite, I am ready to make the maximum for Moravia".</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is the time of envisaging that the second division is divided into two parts the one Czech and the other morave whose winners would find themselves in first division."</seg>
<seg id="130">"Situation would not be as presently only with three equips moraves in the division because the problem is presently of finding young players.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, has entered to the competition for the post of President, Rajchl can not evaluate his own chances of winning.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I smell permanently a support of the Bedroom Czech that has elected me her Vice -preside and knows that with me succés will be", has declared Rajchl that plans among his succés futures to save tens of millions of crowns on contracts disadvantageous, of the negotiations of contracts with the televisions and on the law on the games.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the contrary he tells everyone that the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">Even though it says about Pelta "that it is disqualified because with it the Czech footblal would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second adversary Paclik is a strong candidate that has of what to offer to the football.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Nobody can put in doubt to Plzen that it has made this superb year one work".</seg>
<seg id="136">"If it was taken up it would surely continue in what has been begun by Hasek and would not make change notable among the people in the Commissions."</seg>
<seg id="137">"He would not want to waste itself his succés"a said Rajchl that has evaluated his rivals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The most beautiful swimming-pools of Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A jump in the blue</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Of Julia Stanek</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Baby pools in optics of flying saucer, magnificent swimming-pools of Budapest: That journey across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having turned the city or made a long walk- can let rest his legs tired in baths of sparkling water.</seg>
<seg id="5">A watch book in what pool of swimming one can experience the biggest well-being.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder went on journey of research for the 18 last months, there is an object that should not miss in his luggages: his swimsuit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Spread on his back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam contrary to the marbles Putten that waited for it across of the swimming-pool and did not miss of admiring the art nouveau meticulously restored of these converted swimming-pools.</seg>
<seg id="8">If a covered swimming-pool made him pleasure, she noticed in his notebook without deadline all the details worthy of interest on the type of building and on the history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 swimming-pools have been probed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and it them have presented in his already published book: "Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath". The municipal covered swimming-pools of Münich, the historical palaces of bath in the black forest, "buildings of concrete Hardcore" in the Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It has driven his "journeys to the most exceptional baths of the central Europe" to 13 countries. Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited respectively places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The German of 46 years is a true devotee of the culture of the bath.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meder, explains that it does not have a lot of interest as the sport but ell feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is irritating that the supporters of the swimming must content with contemplating blue tiles and adapting to the stench of the bleach while the joggers breathe perfume bewitching of the forests of spruce or can listen to chirping of birds cheerful of the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have wondered a day why the swimming-pools must actually be always so ugly" has said the viennoise one.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I began therefore a collection of beautiful baths."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The surface of the water reinforces the architecture doubly</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">A diving in a swimming-pool and the volatile oils of sauna - factor of well-being in the rooms of swimming are enormous because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builders would have worked hard a bit more of grief, the rooms to swim could be a true delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor one has a surface of water in the rooms of swimming."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is transparent from a side, but she reflects the beauty of the very whole building from another side however."</seg>
<seg id="20">All the surfaces appear optiquement in a way doubles: of the high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The volume of picture of small format "Badefreuden" makes a relation worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and of culture on the oasis of the historical well-being - it gives desire of making a jump in the blue probably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The collector Meder has discovered remarkable copies during his investigations in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beside the baths of splendid well-beings as the bath Széchenyi aged of 100 years in Budapest, it took on waters containing nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (bath of cavern in Miskolc-Tapolca) as a bath of thermal baths whose pools are full of water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and being in a building in the form of bottle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the other hand, the swimming-pools warmed outdoors of Switzerland and of Austria offer of the spectacular sights. While from a roof of the bath of Zürich one has the whole city at his eyes, one can admire the Arlberg covered with snow from an exterior swimming-pool of St. Anton: The bath Turkish is provided with a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski slope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Maybe the most extraordinary conception of swimming-pool waits for the swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a FLYING SAUCER that has just landed on Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">In winter, steam rises of the three open trays, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal heavenwards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the black forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">the smell of the bleach does not emanate of all the swimming-pools of the collection Meder.</seg>
<seg id="29">Numerous thermic baths emanate a smell of sulfur, of the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which it is difficult to believe, of being in a spa health.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen of carbon that is nearly black and his silt sticks you at the skin as soon as you let yourself slip in the swimming-pool - an experience of special spa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">During his pursuit of the beautiful swimming-pools, Iris Meder also has undergone disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free exterior swimming-pool and outdoors of Czechoslovakia, she has found itself in front of a ground barricaded.</seg>
<seg id="32">The conceived bath by the architèque Dusan Jurkovic in 1902 meanwhile was closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">Throwing a glance by the window from the building-Art Nouveau in red-white-yellow, she has observed the blooming of the bad herbs between the tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">She has observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming-pool in Black Forest: The palace of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad.</seg>
<seg id="35">This building already has survived three stages; one can discover not only of the neo-roman elements that go out from his conception in 1844 but still a Moorish room in style Alhambra that has been added it in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For his tidy modernization of 1995, the thermal palace is the favorite bath of the expert in swimming-pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is already a beautiful yield that of of melting so different styles of building in a so tremendous unity", said Meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">Apparently, with such a palace, the diving in the thermal swimming-pool is only a minor question.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The German bank examines in details the speculation on the matter first</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Of Christian Teevs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The German bank abandon it her speculation on the raw materials?</seg>
<seg id="5">According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has assigned a group of work of searching for the consequences of the speculation for the poor ones of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the leader of the group wants to get out afterwards some of the consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg -</seg>
<seg id="8">For the citizens of the federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of the Germans find unacceptable that the banks speculate on the raw materials as the corn and the wheat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of the questioned people require even that the German bank and other institutes of credit discontinue this avenue of businesses because it increases the problems of the poorest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the result of an inquiry Forsa on the order of the organization of the consumers Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based itself on a relation presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author Harald Schumann underlines in this article that the speculation of the Stock-Exchanges on the global raw materials, moves the prices upwards and that the banks share a complicity to the world famine.</seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign of protection of consumers lines up concretely against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the great banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The speculation on the raw materials was initially introduced to protect the traders from the fluctuations of the prices.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the majority of experts share meanwhile the opinion that the gamblers have freed from the offers and asks - and take advantage to the expenses of the very poor ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no business is worth the trouble to put at stake the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information of the SPIEGEL ONLINE a group of international work examines the accusations of Foodwatch-Report presently.</seg>
<seg id="18">The examination must be finished of here the end of the year, afterwards the results of the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, in a usual way.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thin January, the leader of the Bank will indicate the consequences to pull.</seg>
<seg id="20">It a reduction of the market of the raw materials, or well even a complete abandonment could result from it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann builds his Picture</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has greeted the news, but at the same time has confirmed his criticisms to the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise of the prices of the food produce shows in a particularly draconian way, to what point the banks of today harm the general interest."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann is the first banked lobby to be today under obligation particularly.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the investments from his wallet, for which of the money has been invested on the food" speculations has declared Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">"That is little important, for Mister Ackermann, if it is question of the hungry people or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The awareness of Ackermann can seem to first sight amazing, but it is clear that the PDG of the group wishes to present a perfect picture, some months before leaving his duties.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Deutsche Bank has made to announce Monday that the president of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is foreseen within the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ll could improve his brand image with an abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculations.</seg>
<seg id="29">And about possible losses, it hardly has to care about it - it will worry his successor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">One on two would cancel the investments on the raw materials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch endeavors to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">Until now more than 30 000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bode has published the survey Tuesday, with which on November 7th and 8th the Institute Forsa has carried out questionnaires next to 1001 people.</seg>
<seg id="34">Just eleven percent have found that legitimate that the Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which of the bets on the prices of the foodstuffs are made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Numerous customers of the bank would get out some also of the personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such operations: one on two would cancel, with reference to the survey, all the investments for which money is injected in the speculations on the raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="36">43 percent would advise of such a bank to their environment, 49% have replied that they would think about the termination of their account to change banked establishment.</seg>

<seg id="1">21st house in Vienna</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The House that has moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Of Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A history of architecture with tops, of the bottoms and one Happy End: the Austrian house for the world exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 has taken away prices, has been a museum in Vienna, has remained empty then has fallen in ruins.</seg>
<seg id="5">At present it is again opened and serves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If one is enthusiastic about an architecture of modern post-war period, for his clear forms, his sheds in glass, his lively and bold appearances and his new materials of building that are typical of the belief to the technical progress, then the house of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and celebrates example.</seg>
<seg id="7">The House of Schwanzer received in the past the "Grand Prix of Architecture" for his building in steel and in glass, light and suspended.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is considered until our days as an important stage in the contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has made the architects so famous, that he has also built the House for the next Austrian universal exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary house at four cylinders of BMW and his adjacent building in the form of bowl in Munich, it has finally become famous at the international level in 1973.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">His project of house as temporary building had been exposed after the universal exposure in the Switzerland Garden to the station of the south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century has opened -</seg>
<seg id="12">But the building neither physically nor technically was adapted for a museum - not of walls to catch the works of art, therefore not a good environment.</seg>
<seg id="13">Though as long it has been used, jusqu"à what the contemporary art receives a new edifice in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="14">For 2001 the building was empty and has fallen apart more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">At present the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the House, it carries now the name of "House of the 21st century" and will be in future used as museum for the contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tuesday night the museum Belvédère has opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck to every viewpoint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The new departure has been seen through by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who has become the guiding news in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, has upgraded a historian of art to a sizeable career between other in his youth of artistic skater, thereafter by Sotheby's, to the museum Guggenheim and as manager founder of the museum of the modern art of Salzbourg, she has seen through particularly the works of transformation next to the politicians and of the protection of the monuments, it has obtained public funds and private sponsoring and has established the exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Excepted the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation carries the same name to it have been exposed, a coffee and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict surveillance, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because it had transformed and had broadened with sensibility the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had won the competition, but because he had studied to the University technique of Vienna and that for it the house was "an extremely important place" place where he had seen "virtually every weekend" the exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">It experienced the project of origin, and it experienced the problems of the edifice, which lost in generosity and lightness with reference to his moving to Vienna and throughout his change of use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">During the present transformations, big problems were: l"édifice was "an abyss in energy", says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The profiles of windows of the fronts in glass had changed, isolating glass reinforced in glass fibers was put and the roof replaced with a glass of individual safety.</seg>
<seg id="26">The girders of the thermic bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements have made from the place to the new exploitation, a sign of light sifted between the house and the road assures the lighting, a bridge driven to the entry - it is nearly a new building, but always the light House Schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">The exterior doors of origins have remained, the house is painted in a protection shade against the rust of color red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the movie theater is even exactly identical to what it was in the past.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all that under narrow surveillance of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often materials that are good and little expensive had to be found, and that enjoy also to the service of the protection monuments", says Krischanitz and it attracts the attention on a rough ground in basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In spite of all the pressures, the problems and the transformations, l"édifice has remained supple and light.</seg>
<seg id="33">That would have been difficult with the House, "which came from Brussels", has said Krischanitz lately, a typical history of "Drop-in-the-City".</seg>
<seg id="34">Such an architecture is "always at the bad place" and wants to "awaken" despite everything "the good conscience".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">But in that case the House of the 21st century is not to the bad place, because if it is a matter of a stroke of luck of urban building: around the Switzerland Garden rises up precisely the "area of the central station" very recently foreseen, with offices and apartments.</seg>
<seg id="36">And maybe another stroke of luck is going to happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the help of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the center of berlinois temporary art, and as it is said, she negotiates already with the city in order to obtain a site in the neighborhood from the Switzerland Garden.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Buffett, the guru of the finance, invests colossal sums in the firm TI of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since March, he has bought actions for a value of more than ten billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in computer firms TI, considering that l"évolution in the long term of the societies let only bad forecasts appear.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has read the relations of IBM though and has changed his opinion about the investments in this sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It had already of the to understand much earlier than IBM proposes especially benefits of services and computer systems for the sectors TI of other firms.</seg>
<seg id="7">An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as an attack of knight in the world of the finance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Consequently the activity TI IBM is granted itself the right to be called at present "IBM mister".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Because Buffett has revealed today CNBC to economic l"émission, that he has bought since March actions IBM of a value of 10,7 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">His holding company society of investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a big shareholder of IBM with a part of 5.5 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Buffett has said that IBM anything has not known ever of this commitment so far.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has congratulated the direction, which even during the economic crisis had assured reasonable profits.</seg>
<seg id="13">"You have made a super work", has said Buffett strategically.</seg>

<seg id="22">It is for that that it is a cult face for numerous investors of the whole world.</seg>

<seg id="1">The threat is palpable</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" the Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper talks even about a "bloody ideology", which would re-arise at present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The murders of eight Turkish nationals and of a small Greek firm in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.</seg>
<seg id="5">With reference to this news, Turkey as the population germano-turque reacts with fear and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because for a lot of germano-turcs the ghost that one believed death for long redoes his appearance: from the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and to Solingen in May 1993, there has not been anymore comparable violence with this extremist context of right against the Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">That a xenophobia is in Germany, never it has been nevertheless question.</seg>
<seg id="8">The extremist network of right that has been detected reveals though proportions whose dimension is far from being predictable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"It is a return to the bloody ideology, Such a was the title of the publication on internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".</seg>
<seg id="10">On the other hand the newspaper "Sabah" underlines that one of the authors would have been a v-homme of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the mess of extreme right wing.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is in a reasoned way that the Turkish community in Germany has reacted: she has called this weekend to a commemoration silencer to the victims of racial violence in front of the door of Brandenburg.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not that two weeks beforehand only the Turkish community of Berlin and the German and Turkish political ones had thought about a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the germano-turc agreement of recruitment.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been directed, symbolizing a history of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The relations of some Turkish media make the effect of a slap: "the present of Germany for the fiftieth birthday" such a is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", who refers to the context of the series of murders.</seg>
<seg id="15">So the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not hold back of getting out some of the univocal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="16">"that starts stinking", Such a is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">It underlines that people would have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have brought an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.</seg>
<seg id="18">The action of the police has been perceived in a very critical way on the germano-turcs forums and these had thereafter discussed the success of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="19">  Why already it has not come much more early to the mind of the German authorities of making investigations in some environments suspects of extreme right, are surprised the authors.</seg>
<seg id="20">More than one appears ready at least to rhetorical indeed drastic means: "If the business continues be botched, it will not be left to the migrants nothing else than the self-defense and the armament".</seg>
<seg id="21">"that will be well the best self-defense".</seg>
<seg id="22">"The inner peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of the information and on the pertinence of the punishment of the unity of the network", writes "Selen".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What that means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the years 90 well have explained.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event has shown no more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, who the mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could lead on to.</seg>
<seg id="26">The attacks though have sharpened the feeling of the us in the Turkish community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Never repeating the mistakes of the past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the past it is especially the failure of the German policy after the attacks whose Turkish press has complained: Helmut Kohl has refused to visit to the survivors of Mölln.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the fire of Solingen it has sent a telegram of condolences to the Leader of the Turkish State, has made to represent to the obsequies in Cologne by his Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel Minister of Foreign Affairs counted at that time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population caused.</seg>
<seg id="30">As if the value of a man could be evaluated on the amount of his tax burdens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The present relation of the Turkish media shows a time furthermore how much the mistrust of a lot of Germano-turcs is deep to l"état of local right for this date.</seg>
<seg id="32">Beside the efforts of a roomier clarification and revaluation of the terrorism of extreme right wing in Germany, a clear message is this time essentials.</seg>

<seg id="1">The bank to scandal of the lake of Zürich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS has made nearly bankruptcy in the crisis financier and patina meanwhile of a crisis to the other one.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a German that must lead now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is not probably it that Axel Weber imagined s"était.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his spectacular departure of the head of the Bundesbank; one has had knowledge in July, which it would occupy in 2013 a nearly as spectacular post: President of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a great step to an unexpected and lucrative career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber has publicly looked forward, has greeted; Switzerland for his beauty and the UBS for his lately obtained solidity and has made to pass kind observations on the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The UBS has completed the Turnaround".</seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">And nevertheless, from the month of September it was clear that everything was going to change.</seg>
<seg id="11">A trader of titles of UBS in London had diverted all the systems of safety from the Bank and had burned about 1.7 billions of euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The leader of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a pretty well known banker not only in Switzerland, has had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">of the President of the board of directors of the UBS is considered for as unwell - and everyone ask: When finally does Axel Weber come back?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">We have already learned that Weber can be recommended from the bank from February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will recover the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank has communicated it Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is not a banker, much more teacher d"économie and President of the bank, and probably it would have needed a period of adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Only of one blow he accepts then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved still a time more that it has for long deserved the title of "the greatest bank to scandal of Europe".</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, the UBS is of an enormous side - up to lately, it was the biggest administrator of active of the world, and of the other one, it skates for years of a scandal to the other one.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, does not spare the so proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">That has begun during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">Up to in 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture of the Swiss administrator of active, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she wanted also evolution, in the domain of the banked investment, a very great bank.</seg>
<seg id="24">Therefore the UBS managed of a side in 2007 with 1.6 billions of dollars more money coming from some easy customers than every other bank to the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, it had advanced as bank of investment in the league of the greatest banks of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">That has made an impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The previous banker Hans Geiger and later teacher of bank for long years to Zurich tells: "I have always taken the UBS as model of good bank in front of my students."</seg>
<seg id="28">In the present optics, one wonders: how quite simply I would have been able to make a mistake to this point"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He has deeply made a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007 it has appeared that for the first time something did not turn round at the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year the president Peter Wuffli has withdrawn from amazing way, which was considered so far as an intellectual top as an inspired banker.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some months later one has sensed for what reasons it had left.</seg>
<seg id="33">The division of the bank had burned with documents sub-prime and has of the to make a cross on billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">To support that, the UBS has announced an increase of capital of an amount of 13 billion francs and has made a cross top.</seg>
<seg id="35">For that indeed she has found investors, but that, little time before, would have frowned: a bottom of non-transparent Asian state coming from Singapore and a bottom of Arabic state, which had passed under silence, so much so that one has even never learned his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That n"était nevertheless that the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008 that is worsened itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to announce again losses being encoded at billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, which was still the second board of directors the one better paid from Switzerland in 2006, retired.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS found itself financial, considering his mistakes of investment, in the crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the State.</seg>
<seg id="40">The national bank has purchased tens of billions of problematic titles to the UBS, Swiss Confederation has considered six billion francs as obligations convertible into actions, for which she could become co-owner of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole Switzerland has been shaken - because she has noticed to what point that can be dramatic for a small country, of sheltering so great banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the total of the assessment of the UBS 2007 s"éleva at more than five times the economic performances of Switzerland (to see graphic).</seg>
<seg id="43">"We have not been able to save the UBS still a time", called the researcher of banks, Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">After the first disaster it has followed itself of the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">Already some months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a fiscal disagreement with America and has declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customers, which maybe had defrauded the tax department with the help of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, she has accepted a payment of 780 million dollars - in repayment of unjustified profits coming from these operations with an increased fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Thus the UBS has more or less published than it had helped in the tax fiddle.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time it has lost something that has always been his capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of the discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal the Swiss bank confidentiality has not been the same one anymore.</seg>
<seg id="50">It followed itself of the withdrawal of the leader of the board of directors and of the president of the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="51">And of the exodus of the money of the customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Thus the bank had lost in some months his credibility in the two main sectors of business: the banked investment because of bad speculations and the management of active because of the help to the tax fiddle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And, as it was about little one return to the quietness, and as one thought it, that the UBS would put through, it followed itself of this unfortunate history of traders of title: only one trader of title flames 1.7 billions of euros, before the bank notices that something did not turn round.</seg>
<seg id="54">And one publishes: with the management of the risks in bank of investment that does not seem always to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With the case Adoboli, one has been able to notice that masters it of the risks to too little changed", said Martin Janssen, economist and teacher of the finances to the banked Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also the chief financial officer of a great German bank is sure: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have the mastery of the risks in hand."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">However it was exactly a matter of the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had for long taken their duty, that of guard evolution of the great fortune of the world: not de trop great risks, but the safety for the money - and the world well could collapse beyond the alpine republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of a steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are it for a particularly noble chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The central one of the UBS to Zurich goes still hand in hand with the plated solid of the Swiss bank private - it is only a bit bigger.</seg>
<seg id="60">Already the situation is classical.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank is based to the central station of Zurich, which drives directly of the central station to the lake of Zurich, that himself is surrounded by the summits covered with snow of the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of stores depict more among the ones raised from Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">The jewellers as Tiffany's, one finds them here between the stores of Swiss traditions everything as those of the sweetshop Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: of the national bank passing by the palace of the Switzerland Credit up to banks deprived elitists as Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">One arrives to the hall of entry of the UBS by a heavy door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside, the walls are dressed in marble, in front find themselves of thick chairs of leather, and beside the logo of the bank, a great label for "safe".</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer searches for here: the safety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank has sometime écarté of the market - or betrayed the two great Swiss banks, the UBS and the Switzerland Credit, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank finds.</seg>
<seg id="69">Him préfèrerait not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all the Swiss bankers it is businesses also with the two great banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS would have become well too big, trouve-t'il - especially in the banked investment, where moreover the Anglo-Saxons would have spread.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss would not have anything more as it to statement.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And when well even, they are themselves for long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">That has been indeed the Anglo-Saxon bank of investment that has changed the UBS, it has made high profits and afterwards thaws it: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle of the sub-prime as the great Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The disaster has become obvious on October 15th, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="75">"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country at the seven million inhabitants has started the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation ", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".</seg>
<seg id="76">With up to 68 billion francs about, is 45 billion euros, the politicians have accepted to rescue the great bank from the bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could that happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998 two of the three great Swiss banks have concluded an enormous group together.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank has been created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and has recorded constantly an increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">What has helped, it is that the two prédécesseuses banks different from the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as strong point the management of active to Zurich and a poorer, but indeed already more strongly internationalized.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the international banks of investment have had favorably access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn an enormous wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 Leader of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, in the past president of the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a team of dream", called the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, that knows very well in modèles and statistical, and Ospel, the intuitive one, who has cleared a path for itself up to the summit with the apprenticeship of the bank."</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel would have trusted jusqu"à the end to Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And wuffli would probably have committed in the end a decisive mistake: "He thought that his models were the reality", says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"It is a tragic fall."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragedy, maybe.</seg>
<seg id="90">A thing is clear: the exuberance has happened before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">The staff of the UBS remembers clearly the meetings of the leaders in the course of whom the leader of the group Wuffli has always pronounced the same watchword: dethroning Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful bank of investment of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="93">It has commanded the "League Tables" the classifications, which have documented at this time the success of the banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">After all the UBS wanted to go up very above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some stages have already succeeded it.</seg>
<seg id="96">In business of currencies and of transactions of movable values she has played a very important role.</seg>
<seg id="97">The advisers of firm, who have had the responsibility, have underlined though a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in the banked gibberish "Fixed Income", would be an enormous difference in relation to the greatest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS would have gaps at the level of the American products of mortgages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill in this gap, the UBS is itself threw in an adventure, who nearly has cost him the life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Thirsty of growth, they are the bank itself as well as a bottom of management created before it in the investments sub-prime American that have invested.</seg>
<seg id="101">It has transformed into a massive machine that has packed and makes to pass the documents of value based on the hypothecary loans American - but that has also preserved of the risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Even while other banks tried for long to go down.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Still in the process of the summer 2007, even though the market of the American one property was in flames, the UBS has bought there", said Geiger, the banked expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">The bigger the euphory is the more brutal the fall is.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after the other one has had to leave, while to put a term to the attempts has proved more difficult than one thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Posts by UBS have become éjectables and are until now bancaux.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">The one that leads the great bank has an almost impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="108">It must take on a strategy for a bank, for whom all the models of firm suggested have disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="1">The intelligent crows spread in cities</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In many places, rooks are considered as "problem of birds °" but the experts maintain that these very intelligent animals do not let themselves hunt anymore of the cities for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Some love them, some others want to dispose itself some of them also in a fast way that possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in numerous communities the complaints of the residents multiply because of the dirt and of the noise of the animals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">An antidote against the "°problème of birds" is not still in sight.</seg>
<seg id="5">During the first ostfriesisch symposium on the crows, the experts have said that it is not no more possible to hunt the rooks from the cities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The experts of the whole Germany has discussed the possible solutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They look for alternatives in the cities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The protectors of the nature based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The use of the chemicals in the agriculture destroys more and more the traditional vital spaces.</seg>
<seg id="9">The hunting, the conversion and the slaughter of typical trees of incubation gave back the birds the difficult life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The crows are under the protection of the nature.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are great colonies with more than 600 couples of incubation in the westfälischen Soest, in the north-west among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim close to Bremen as in Leer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements because of the massacre of the crows in this region.</seg>
<seg id="13">The criticisms have taken on the capture of the birds in traps and their killings with clubs particularly brutal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The normal expulsion, the évincement, does not serve to anything", has noticed the planner of the city and of the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.</seg>
<seg id="15">The destruction of the nests with the aid of the water under pressure or to destroy well the trees, produced often of the undesirable consequences, has told the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser of Lahr to the Bade-Wurtemberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The animals move away, the great colonies divide and they disperse in other places."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">L"évincement is conceivable only in the exceptional cases as in the hospitals, the old people's homes or the schools.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can not exterminate them anymore."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The problem does not let itself solve in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conceivable is a combination of the évincement of the animals to an aversif conditioning and of the tenacious offers, in order to allow them of reinstalling itself elsewhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "signs of info instead of chain saws" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "Better we can bear finally a button to the the face with a dose of self-confidence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Jürgens has co-founded the Ascheberger-progression-educational of the baskets in the Schleswig-Holstein, of the road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent rooks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This project has meanwhile been adopted by the tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Jürgen has given his own opinion about the criticism with regard to the noise caused by the birds: "This is a great number of communication, those birds have a lot to tell to itself".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The intelligence and the skilfulness of the animals are legendary: The rooks do not use only instruments of work to arrive to a delight but they produce themselves their tools as instruments of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Ethologists of the university of Cambridge tested four rooks lately, to what point the intelligence of the birds happens.</seg>
<seg id="27">In an experience, the birds learned in a fast way that they had to make to collapse a scaffolding with stones to reach thus a larva.</seg>
<seg id="28">Without a lot of training, they recognized déterminément that a stone had to have some thickness and form to make the platform knock down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In a second testing, the shrewd crows had to solve a squatter problem afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a cylinder put vertically, the researchers had put a small bucket with a larva.</seg>
<seg id="31">The birds could not reach their loot with their beak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Though, the researchers had put pieces of wire to their arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="33">All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.</seg>
<seg id="34">Three of the four rooks one succeeds even from the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1">The slaughter of staff mass</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The new book of Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The beauty and the sorrow: a personal history of the First World War), it begins by a long list of characters that grips you the heart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">An advice to begin: tear this page tidily and make some your bookmark.</seg>
<seg id="4">You will learn to know these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in the course of these few moments that, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and despaired in the mists of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the price Nobel of literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has written here a book out of the common one that it describes, with exactitude, as "a work of anti-history."</seg>
<seg id="8">It comprises some well known names, of the important treaties or of the famous battles; one does not find presqu no ambassador nor discussion on the strategies and the material.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book on what he has passed to itself, it explains, only a "describing book" that "that could look" like. One finds the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"The beauty and the sorrow" summarizes the experiences in time of war of 20 men and more or less ordinary women, of the two sides of the war, of young schoolboys and botanists to escaladeurs, going by by the doctors, ambulance drivers and salesmen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some will become heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others of the prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become mad or will lose the life.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives stagger here as the candles of a church: even though some switch off, one relights some of new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book of Peter Englund moves away from the traditional books of history.</seg>
<seg id="15">It brings a denial to the idea according to which the First World War amounts only by the terrible war of the trenches on the western forehead.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The beauty and the sorrow" described skillfully from other theaters of war: Alps, the Balkans, the eastern forehead, Mesopotamia and the eastern Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The present soldiers in this book are under hives; one pass Noël in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an inflexible problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This book is moving from the first page.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war invades the lives of these people such a natural, such disaster a hurricane Katrina that stinks of the cordite.</seg>
<seg id="20">While blows of cannon ring in the distance, and that you are a mother at the home, do you stay or do you run away?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who will come anyway?</seg>
<seg id="22">Nearly nobody can understand what he has passed to itself, or even the reasons of this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been expanded by assumptions, hopes, fears, permanent ideas, conspirationnistes theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty and the sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English babysitter within the Russian army, as Richard Stumpf, a sea teenager of the fleet of high German sea.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their histories are principally long treks of dissertations, of letters and of other already published documents.</seg>
<seg id="26">The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most protected thanks to the accumulation from small moments and from isolated details.</seg>
<seg id="27">The majority approach the deprivation and the capacity for putting through.</seg>
<seg id="28">Telling the history of a German schoolboy, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Coffee of substitution, fake aluminum, imitation of rubber, bandages in paper, buttons in wood."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He continues on the food of substitution in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">It describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in fat of sheep (and finished with a fake bone of wood); the tobacco produced with dry roots and skin dried from potato; soles of shoes in wood."</seg>
<seg id="32">He maintains that "837 authorized meats of substitution are recorded in the production of sausages. One finds also 511 coffees of substitution."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some histories approach the honor and the courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognizes his own impulse to the savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is it to what the men were intended, rather than of to sit itself in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a best seller, both rather only of claiming that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is not any barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In an opposite way, a British soldier realizes that it risks strong of dying, and that nobody will notice it or will not pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">"While one is resigned to sacrifice itself, one hopes to have a" written "public"-him.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and of new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition" written Peter Englund, "a war between the factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of mass pretty articulate and convinced ideologically, in clothes well cut, who carries out his butcher's shop all being sat behind a counter."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The people act in an unexpected way; one finds as many behaviors of base as heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal illness by prostitutes in order to avoid the service au front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"One finds the expression the most ludicrous in the business of could owed to the gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and s"étalent on the genitals in the hope to finish to the hospital", writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"The most desperate apply it on the eyes, what is translated by a blindness for life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is supple but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="46">In tens of short scenes, it seizes the way whose war has "started exclusively unverifiable strengths: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion for the religion. "</seg>
<seg id="47">The people start wondering why their leaders make them a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The great war and the modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or "Westwards nothing again", of Erich Maria Remarque, rather that complete.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work of Peter Englund is a little conventional pantheon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictionnelle work.</seg>
<seg id="51">I will not reveal it.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if it had arisen of his book, seized of your hands this page where the list of people and burned with a match appears.</seg>

<seg id="1">The union of the school aids prosecutes the city for dismissals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The union that represents hundreds of school aids having lost their job last month foresees of bringing Wednesday a trial to the city for useless and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportioned on the schools receiving disadvantaged schoolboys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The pursuits are the ultimate weapon of the union, Advice of the 37th District, probably to try to make the dismissals cancel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred and seventy-two school aids, coordinators of parents and other employees, being part of the ones less well paid from the city, have lost their job on last October 7th. The union leaders have compared these dismissals with a political revenge not to have let the city reach a bottom for care of health led by the groups of workers, and who would have allowed closing the gap of budget at the last spring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The municipal authorities have denied categorically this accusation.</seg>
<seg id="6">During an audience of the Town Council last month, the chancellor Dennis M. Walcott has declared that the dismissals constituted a part of the budget closed in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the Advice has riposted, mentioning that the dismissals of the school aids n"étaient in no way specified in the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The officers of the Advice of the 37th District have declared that they would fill an opinion with complaint, warning the department of the education of his being pursued; a press conference will be organized Wednesday to announce officially the judicial pursuits at the High Court of State of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dennis M. Walcott and the department of l"éducation of the city will constitute the defendant part. The plaintiffs will be represented with eight dismissed workers, all of latino-américaines black color or origin, as most of the school aids that have lost their job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the legal department of the city, has declared that the municipality has yet not been able to see the reasons of the trial and can not make therefore comments on the allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to an outline of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would bet the most discriminated against of the city to support his complaint against an inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose the most aids because of a regular under-financing, on the number of dismissals in the schools of the areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">While one does not count any dismissal on Staten Island, and some hardly in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aids have lost their job in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the areas south of the Bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Noticing the loss of five school aids on eight employees to the state school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of the schoolboys live in the poverty, the pursuits assert that "it Is not an area of easy parents that can take funds to fill in the budget lack."</seg>

<seg id="1">Downright mission: the Conference takes on an agreement on the question of Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats have found an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the uprising in Lybie.</seg>
<seg id="3">A successful uprising, the capture and the death of the dictator of long date Muammar Kadhafi as the American involvement will have been needed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The committee of the foreign relationships of the Senate will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by the President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with the senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution consists to honor the courage of the Libyans even though they start reconstructing their country" has declared John Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language is maybe inoffensive but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, legislators of the two parties have gone in conflict, as with the White House, on the expression of several resolutions aiming at approving or not the military role of the United States in the mission of the NATO in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution aiming at authorizing the limited job of American military strengths in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bill has been defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and has never been the subject to a vote to the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But the same day of the failure of the bill, Parliament has also thrown back a measure aiming at reducing the financing of the American operations to Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American mission therefore has remained under a form of legislative purgatory - the Conference sufficiently annoyed to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut it the grass under the foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The indecision of the Conference has been exceeded by the events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi has been killed on last October 20th.</seg>
<seg id="15">The mission of the NATO has officially ended on October 31st.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Senate can at present to act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee of the foreign relationships "congratulates the Libyan people for his "extraordinary" courage and determination with a view to the freedom" and "congratulates the men and women" of the American armed forces and their partners of the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution asserts also "the national interest of the United States to get to a transition irreversible and succeeded to the democracy in Libya."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Will the new measure take away all the support of the Commission of the foreign businesses of the Senate or will it divide the legislators as in last June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The senator and president of the Commission Moneybags D. Lugar (Independent) is itself opposite to the last version.</seg>
<seg id="21">His spokesperson has declared project last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the very last version again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Within the Capitol, the Bedroom must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority nearly for all the Republicans of the Conference, and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measure, supported by the Republican Bobsleigh Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relative to the budget, or every other question, to obtain from floor to the Bedroom or to the Senate a vote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other legislators do not have so far not succeeded to make their amendments approve but it is not without having tried.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been presented to the Conference, on a broad fan of subjects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed at the same time to the Bedroom and to the Senate - and others are light variations of a precedent.</seg>
<seg id="27">One counts at least 15 versions to the Bedroom uniquely of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that "would control the federal expenses".</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of these bills are identical, but give to their supports - notably the new Republicans that wish to gild their CV - the luck of priding oneself on being "the author" of such a measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in last August asked the vote of the Bedroom and of the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators one voted in favor of a not constraining resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which the members of the Conference can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two mandates for the presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a lot of amendments guaranteeing the right to an education of quality and to the care of health, among other subjects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">An amendment forbidding the marriage among individuals of same sex is perpetually proposed, all as the amendment forbidding the desecration of the flag.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some legislators wish to authorize also the annulation of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Also eager that have been the members of offering amendments, they are not so fast as by the past.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the 111th Conference, the legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 during the 110th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The rhythm slows down by relation at the beginning of the years 1990, while the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the numbers supplied by the library of the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But these amendments did not have much more success than they have some today.</seg>
<seg id="39">The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - has been ratified in 1992 but he has been proposed to the Conference in 1789.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Slaughtered but not beat" asserts Gabrielle Giffords during his first meeting televised for the shooting</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ten months after an armed man has pulled it top at point-blank range to Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) has appeared Monday night in a televised emission, has sung "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and has declared to want rather to recover above all that to return to the Conference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">During his appearance to the television news "20/20" on the ABC chain, to the side of Reveille Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has fought to form sentences and needed help to walk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">L"émission has approached his difficult return with reference to the ball that has fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Three months ago, it had made the text relative to the ceiling of the debt a return surprising in the House of Representatives to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During his first meeting televised for the shooting of January, which has killed six people and hurt thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords has smiled, laughed and sung - and described his restoration of "difficult".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">After Diane Sawyer has asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years, has replied "rather well".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The meeting with Gabrielle Giffords and his husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, has taken place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", diffused the eve of the exit of the new book of the titled couple "Gabby: a history of courage and of hope".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Special L"émission has related the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords for the shooting of January 8th.</seg>
<seg id="10">In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, one sees it on his bed of hospital, the shaven head and a wide scar on the forehead.</seg>
<seg id="11">She manages to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragements of his husband.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Some months more late, Gabrielle Giffords is sat in a wheelchair even though the doctors teach him to carry out simple actions.</seg>
<seg id="13">A sign of the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">A movement of the lips.</seg>
<seg id="15">And finally, his first word: "Which".</seg>
<seg id="16">Some days more late, Gabrielle Giffords has whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu from his small breakfast.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of the music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: one sees the Representative at singing the air of Cyndi Lauper with the doctors "Chorus girls Wanna Cuts Fun" and of Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">During the meeting with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends every day two hours with the doctors, has declared not to remember the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to his husband, it was reading it an article on the shooting of March 12th while it has stopped it and asked for the first time for information on the six people killed during the incident.</seg>
<seg id="20">The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison of Missouri and sturdily treated waiting for the trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"There have been many deaths" has declared Gabrielle Giffords in Diane Sawyer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hard, hard, hard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">During his restoration, has declared Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, it has said "I have been beaten."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Therefore I would say," Gabby, "you have not been beaten", has asserted Mark Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="25">You have fair summer slaughtered.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Kid Rock has sung a ballad on the impotence, the frustration and the loss.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Sailors around it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crowd in suit-tie has put itself standing at his feet to acclaim it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"The servicemen, men and women, heroes are considered", has declared David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of fund of the spring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A military haut-gradé present at the gala, which also the admiral Mike Mullen participated in, leader d"état-major of the armies of the United States, has seen the role of the troops in a different way.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">"They have been presented as a kind of orphan", has written the military haut-gradé in an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am sure about the organizers having good intentions.</seg>
<seg id="10">I know it.</seg>
<seg id="11">But this n"était not of the respect. Just pity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the servicemen and a passionate American public but often distant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.</seg>
<seg id="14">But they have some price, declare some servicemen.</seg>
<seg id="15">The public acts more and more as if he was distressed for the men and women in uniform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We are not at all victims" has declared the general sergeant Sean B. MacFarland, who has directed the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"But it would seem that the only way of supporting us is of closing us in in the role of unlucky minds."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is a matter of a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, which do not wish to seem not grateful or in disagreement with the public that they serve.</seg>
<seg id="19">They realize that the anger of the troops coming back from the war of the Vietnam has been well worse also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Thus, most of the conversations on the pity take place in every confidentiality among the veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">After the return of his two sons of the fighting with the Navies, the colonel reprocessed Mark Cancian has warned them of the public considering their service under two perspectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Some would concern them with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and have traveled to distant lands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Others would wonder if "a veteran in anger and violent hides under the surface" has declared Cancian, which has fought in Iraq and has come back to work to the Government in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">While it searched for a job, it has declared, it felt what any people that made to him to pass the maintenances asked in a subtle way if it would be capable to keep the blow under the stress of a job requiring his return of the fighting in Washington immédiatement après.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"While you approach the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions", remind the colonel Cancian while he talks to his sons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The difficulties of the servicemen arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.</seg>
<seg id="27">The victories are seldom congratulated by an as little familiar country with the army and who sees few direct advantages of the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"As nation, we do not value anymore the heroism in the same way as for the Second World War" declare the general lieutenant reprocessed David Barno, who has directed the troops in Afghanistan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Instead of that, the congratulations of the politicians and of the people largely concentrate on the depth of the sufferings of a serviceman.</seg>

<seg id="1">The army in view of the increasing pressure of raging against the rapists</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a major audience will decide if 28 men and women will go in trial against the army for an inactivity required regarding rapes.</seg>
<seg id="3">In this case, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the neighbor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The soldier of 1st class Elizabeth Lyman was aged of 25 years and pregnant with 11 weeks the night where she maintains to have been raped by a soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">C"était in October 2008. It fit at his barracks in Miramar Air Station, to the north of San Diego, after having dined with a friend, while it has met a colleague transporting a pack of beers.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has asked him if it could join it in his bedroom to drink a glass.</seg>
<seg id="7">"C"était an alarm signal" declares Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texane has left aside his anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="9">I have thought: not, it has 19 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is of Texas" it says.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I will have had to follow my intuition."</seg>
<seg id="12">Some minutes after having entered to the bedroom of Elizabeth Lyman, the man has caught it by behind, thrown by earth and violated, it claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 others military, certain still in operation and of others not, will wait with anxiety for the decision of justice during a historical trial that will take place to Arlington, in Virginia, and that will decide if a trial carried against the previous secretary to the defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter are marked of not having stopped the generalization of the rapes within the army, going thus contrary to the constitutional laws of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, the trial implied to the departure 17 plaintiffs. This number has risen at 28 the next months - 25 women and 3 men, everyone claiming to have been raped or to have been deceived sexually by soldier colleagues. They claim also that the army has not held an inquiry, hounded nor supplied with justice adapted after the alleged attacks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Susan Burke declares to blame the servicemen trimmed, because the problem begins by them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The army is a vertical structure" suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the individuals in position d"éradiquer the culture of retaliations? The leaders."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The lawyer declares also that since the month of February, she has been contacted nearly by 400 other survivors, of which the majority can to be part of judicial future pursuits.</seg>
<seg id="20">His strategy: instead of rallying all the plaintiffs in this business - putting thus all his eggs in the same basket - it will bring several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of the defense, for the Department of the Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, has put down a motion to throw back the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defense, and mainly the fact that the army can not be pursued by soldiers in operation or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a decision of 1950 of the High Court, named the Doctrine Feres, the federal Government is not a person in charge of injuries undergone by the staff in operation active.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged harm is inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs" indicate the documents.</seg>
<seg id="25">The department of the Defense has refused to make every comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The things have changed for the years 50.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even though the women do not have always the right to go to the fighting, officially, this distinction is noted down only on paper: the lines head-on recent wars are seldom uniquely male.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers play a more and more important role, to get with the local women in contact notably.</seg>
<seg id="29">Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost the life - two thirds in situation of fighting.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time for the army of modernizing itself declares Susan Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is not alone to lead this fighting: three other trials are in process on top of hers.</seg>
<seg id="32">To l"école of right of Yale, the center of legal services of the veterans prepares a business against the four main military academies to have so-called to encourage a misogynous atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="33">On the other hand, the foundation to not lucrative goal Vietnam Veterans of America prepares one trial against the army, concentrating on the diagnoses of "confusion of the personality" attributed to the victims of the rapes in order to dismiss them - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women sec Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for the human rights.</seg>
<seg id="34">His group has started proceedings in December to the Administration of the Veterans, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way of treating the requests of advantages for the people declaring to have been victims of a sexual agression in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine independent bills ones of the others have been presented to the Conference by a mixture bipartisan of senators and representatives, proposing diverse solutions.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, 3.158 agressions sexual have been recorded according to the center of intervention and of prevention of the agressions sexual (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the department of the defense.</seg>
<seg id="37">But well it is known that numbers it of agressions sexual is underestimated. Indeed, according to the own appraisal of the Pentagon, this number represents about 13,5% of the 19.000 incidents occurred that year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The relation seemed in March studies also the percentage of judicial pursuits: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army have been the subject to a trial - half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs of the business of Susan Burke describe their agression as the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the business of Lyman, it informs the Military Police of the rape less than one hour after the facts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Tonight it says, one has asked to him to tell 11 times in details his rape to different policemen, doctors and majors.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has undergone a "rape kit" (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of his aggressor - owed to a break to his arm - has been found in his bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sat in front of a judge, to a trial in the course of which one questions it about his sexual relationships with his boyfriend earlier the day of his agression.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people have testified as character references for the author of the crime, which has ended up being settled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember of the day where the verdict" has been given back declares Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I have believed that I was going to start having contractions. I have started to cry after the court."</seg>
<seg id="47">"I have been put in psychiatric unity, and while I have gone out, I remember to have told to my major It was not his trial but mine."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Elizabeth Lyman has been forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who has ended up diagnosing a confusion of the personality, making it incapable of the service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, it has been dismissed under terms less that honorable, preventing it from receiving indifferent advantage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The business Lyman and other plaintiffs will advance or not, it is a long history, declares John Turley, teacher of right to the Faculty of Right of the university of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, it makes to notice, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance".</seg>
<seg id="52">Only this doctrine criticized for his introduction is between them and a verdict.</seg>
<seg id="53">I have always criticized the doctrine Feres.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army finds itself of the decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of dissuasion put by the responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"The chances are heavily against them... but it is important "that they try", it adds.</seg>
<seg id="56">These things change uniquely while the good ones have the will of fighting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will rally his hundred other plaintiffs for other trials.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We will continue fight against the army on this question as long as reform will not be" it asserts.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple lad making part of his anti-immigration opinions online.</seg>
<seg id="3">Monday, Breivik, which has admitted to have been seized by a murderous madness in Norway at the month of July leaving 77 victims, has been confronted with his first trial.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though Breivik has acts alone, it was far from the being on the cyberspace: he had spent a great part of the time preceding the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the million nationalists who support the groups of extreme right on the sites of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wish to know some more on these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how to take them on?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy... Do you connect to Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We have realized that him n"était not as difficult as that of finding them", declares Jamie Bartlett, main author of a relation published lately by the think tank of DEMOS on the numeric populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Facebook abounds in so many personal information, asserts Jamie Bartlett, which the researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to consider it the people that they look with a precision for scientist - the way whose marketing experts make it for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">L"équipe of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that a half-million of members are fans of the groups of extreme right in Europe. She has targeted them with announcements, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the announcements invited the users to reply to an inquiry. The asked questions concerned their level of education, their attitudes in view of the violence and their optimism as for their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Getting with these people in contact thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have been able to question 10.000 partisans of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a new way of making research", declares Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some results are not at all amazing: the online partisans of the groups of right are rather men, young and against the immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But astonishingly, "those that associate online activism and hors-ligne are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those that remain behind their screen of computer."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">L"étude of DEMOS is only an example on the way in which Facebook has become the new inescapable tool between the hands of the scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The think tanks, the researchers in medicine and the political scientists use the site to study all the subjects that affect the questions of health as the social tendencies, thanks to the "I love", publications on the walls and updatings of statutes.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users who add on average three contents by day, the "supernova of the data" generates an explosion as regards research, increasing the number of works of research of which the name of the site appears in the title nearly of 800% in relation to the five last years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook resides in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not bring closer to the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Before, while you tried to carry out inquiries on the people of the British national party, identifying them was very difficult."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You had to surrender to the party, but never they would have allowed to you to go", declares Jamie Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook spare all that to you have directly access to their information. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could offer a means of identifying and of treating the sanitary and social problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of the university of the Wisconsin-Madison, and of his colleagues, the young students who talked about Facebook of their exploits in a state of intoxication had enormously more chances of being alcoholic than the discreet students on that subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the advisers, could watch the site and intervene to help possibly a student whose statute would talk too often about alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can not treat a problem if you do not diagnose it", Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and manager of the center for the health, the behavior and the development of the children at the Institute of research for the children situated in Seattle, asserts the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We know how to identify the children with risks, and that would not be in another case not recognized."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also reaches the information of his users constantly.</seg>
<seg id="28">L"équipe of the site that takes care of the data has studied the statistics regarding the passionate situation and the day of the saint Valentin, the rate of participation to the elections of mid-mandate of 2010 and a clue of national happiness (thanks to the uniquely available information - the champions of the numeric freedom have during long elevated that the site could make available his treasure of data to other people at ends of research).</seg>
<seg id="29">But the users of Facebook know that the site observes them, that that enjoy them or not - in return for being able to play at the Scrabble with a friend that feels at thousands of kilometers, the site is allowed to reach your information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what does he pass to itself while the users of Facebook are part of an inquiry whose same step heard speak they do not have?</seg>
<seg id="31">Even though the researchers have orders well defined as for the way of gathering the information otherwise that going by by the Internet, it is every other online thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not believe that a great number of users already have thought by the way that a researcher can study their profile" declares Neil Selwyn, sociologist to the Laboratory of the Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 that it has led observing the walls Facebook of his students.</seg>
<seg id="33">"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then comes the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even without going by by Internet, there is not any guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, experiencing the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user is impossible.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It that you say about Facebook and what you make in the reality is two totally different things", asserts Neil Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">It is why, in spite of his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a desk pad and a pen remain the best tools that one can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with the people," it declares.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social one, it is not in front of a computer."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, the man having admitted to have organized the two attacks that have made 77 dead men in Norway this summer, is described itself as a combatant "of the resistance" during his first appearance to the trial that takes place in Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military major of the movement of Norwegian resistance and of the Templars of Norway", it explains in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In what concerns the ability of the court, I challenge it, because you have your mandate from organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The judge Torkjel Nesheim has interrupted Breivik during this monolog because he did not "want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason, it has refused to let talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the audience Breivik, which has taken a speech with it on paper.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Nesheim also has asked to the Police to keep Breivik in possession twelve weeks furthermore, has it taboo of speaking to the media for four weeks and has warned it of the authorities watching of very to all the visits and correspondences for eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Thirty of parents of survivors and of victims were present to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some have come to the hope to concern Breivik in the eyes, of other to be sure about his being put behind the bars.</seg>
<seg id="11">Everyone have participated in the audience with the aim of seeing the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I have found it cold and inhuman" has declared a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Me n"étais not comfortably, but a bit I have advanced personally after having seen and heard the suspect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Dressed in a dark suit and in a blue tie, Breivik has remained quiet and professional during the whole trial. It has concerned the journalists and the survivors in the eyes entering and going out from the court.</seg>
<seg id="15">In spite of the strange idea according to which Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge has determined that it was not mad. Also he has declared that there is not any proof that it has acts with accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">The attacks of July 22nd seem to be therefore the work of an extremist rather that of a whole group of radicals, what will comfort maybe some.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that does not reduce the sorrow or the confusion felt by the whole nation.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I will have preferred that it looks like a monster, but it is not the case", has declared a parent of a victim.</seg>
<seg id="19">"That would have been much easier."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons of the interview lost of Steve Jobs, to the cinema this week</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs on last October 5th, some have compared it with Henry Ford - being distinguished by the genius technique and inventor of the modern computing.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it that the fans of Apple can find of more revealing in a maintenance of Steve Jobs found lately and who will be broadcast this week in first part of a film on the main markets, is to what point this creative mind had understood the processes and workflow of the products.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. It identified with a hippy but was also very meticulous and organized, as an améliorateur of flowcharts - a man who believed that numerous leaders of firms suffered from an "illness leaving to them to think that an inspired idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a sizeable quantity of manual work separates an inspired idea of a product of exception."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series relates the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long one and rare conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time, that made about 10 years that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He worked already hard on his new computer firm NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he declares that the main copies have disappeared to the transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is uniquely after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This video, lightly gone back, is the base of the film of 68 minutes titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be diffused to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For well known somebody to hate the maintenances deepen, Steve Jobs seems here astonishingly enthusiastic of displaying technological philosophies and his commercial strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And unbelievably attentive.</seg>
<seg id="12">On four different points during the meeting, the replies come a long moment after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of thought, during which Steve Jobs weighs clearly his thoughts, with the aim of bringing a reply clarify.</seg>
<seg id="13">One discovers also moments that the perfectionism of Steve Jobs reappears, where hearing the questions of Cringely, giving him blows of elbow to make it accelerate and to go by to the questions or subjects of greater importance, seems impatient.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before l"ère of Pixar, of the iPod or of the iPhone, one finds a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers of of good or of bad among the other firms and made part of his own vision on the future of the computing.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a thing to read the posthumous evaluations of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of brute and of inspiring on the man that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of the size.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has a vision on the way whose things can be and must be.</seg>
<seg id="17">It explains them then take them of continuation in work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">These are a fast recapitulative one of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">On the way in which he has learned to lead a firm:</seg>
<seg id="20">For all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you make the things'? and the replies are constantly the same ones: 'oh, simply because they must be made."</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody knows why, nobody thinks in depth about the things in a firm.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is what I have discovered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Steve Jobs continues giving details on his efforts aiming at simplifying the accountancy at Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Perplexed as for the way whose costs were recorded - one begins often by a "standard cost" evaluated in view of nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it has developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On the opportunity to play a turn to the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue box" that it has created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to pirate the telephonic networks and to phone for free in longue-distance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The device has been the subject to numerous written languages beforehand, but the euphory of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is infectious.</seg>
<seg id="28">It describes the way of which it and Wozniak have tested the box using a public phone, passing a call connecting oneself then of a network AT&T to another all bypassing as many satellites that possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We wrapped the ball of different things a half-a-doz of time and you shrieked in the public phone and that a minute later arrived to you to the public phone of nearby," explains Jobs laughing.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we have learned that we could ourselves to create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructures in the whole world. "</seg>
<seg id="31">We did not know much all two, but we have known to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have a day been without that.</seg>
<seg id="32">Steve Jobs continues telling a wonderful turn that it and Wozniak have designed: he has phoned in Vatican with the Blue Box to the beautiful environment of the night being made be taken for Henry Kissinger and has asked to talk to the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even though several members of the Catholic hierarchy are convoked in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in mad fair laugh before the Pope himself is awake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On his love with the technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">To l"âge of 12 years, to the hunt for the spare parts to produce a frequency meter, he looks for the number of Bill Hewlett in the yearbook and passes a phone call to him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Little after their conversation of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs obtains a job from summer part-time at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"That has had one remarkable influence on me. C"était the only firm that I had seen to that age and that has formed my definition of a firm and the way whose employees are treated."</seg>
<seg id="38">Steve Jobs has thereafter become one of the employees HP to visit the laboratories of research of the firm, situated in Palo Alto, where he has discovered the "first computer of office ever conceived."</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as big as a suitcase was, possessed a small cathode ray tube. I have fallen of it in love.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adolescent that j"étais has returned to HP and has started writing programs for this machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On the improvisation of the innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks of inventing new products on a blow of head.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the beginning of his career, even though he settles to sell some cards of printed circuits, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working only on 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembling as of the delivery of the finished devices.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties met to develop a mouse of computer:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember big arguments... one cried me top claiming that I would need five years [to produce a mouse that would cost $300]. I have had enough, I have gone out and have gone to see a designer."</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could produce for $15 and that proved unbelievably reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On the great firms that exhaust themselves:</seg>
<seg id="49">Well before it does not make to live again Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way about which of numerous industrial leaders were going to make a mistake and the control of their part of market lose.</seg>
<seg id="50">Let's "admit that you worked among IBM or Xerox, you make a better cheat or a better printer, and after?"</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the firm does not meet more success.</seg>
<seg id="52">The sales and the marketing can make it to evolve, therefore [it is these types of people] that ended up leading the firms and the staff specialized in product is put to l"écart of the captures of decisions.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius in product that has driven to this position of monopoly completely is rotted by the people that can not imagine to conceive a good product in relation to a bad product - the required manual work.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is what has happened at Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox would have been able to hold all the computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It would have been able to make ten times his present size. Xerox would have been Microsoft of the years 90...</seg>
<seg id="57">They have torn away the defeat from the victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On the innovation as artistic form:</seg>
<seg id="59">"An enormous part of manual work separates an inspired idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."</seg>
<seg id="60">You learn enormously on his subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are compromises to make... Some things that you can not make, the electrons can it, the glass, the robots, the factories also.</seg>
<seg id="62">You must keep thousands of things to the mind (these concepts) assembling them ones to the others.</seg>
<seg id="63">Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. It is a matter of trying to expose yourself to the best products that the men have created, and to try to bring these things at the product that you create.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso has said a day that the good artists copy and that the great artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">We are always ashamed of stealing excellent ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked above were musicians, of the poets, of the zoologists, of the historians, who have simply proved the best computer scientists at the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">If it is not for the computer science, they would have made things extraordinary in another domain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dine with adversaries of the right of the health even though the court meets</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day where the High Court meets behind closed doors to examine the question of political discord, that is to say if the opposition to the law of the President Obama of the health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noticed during a dinner sponsored by the office of lawyers that will defend the business in front of the high court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The event was located last Thursday, while the nine judges have met for a conference aiming at discussing petitions for examination.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the businesses in question concerned a trial brought by 26 States contesting the reform of the care of ambitious health voted for by the Conference last year, a law that has been a point of rallying for the conservative militants to the national ladder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges have admitted to hearing the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5h30 is waited in next March, and the result will be probably by nature to favor the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full expansion to the moment where the decision of the court will be exhausted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will stand in front of the court and will argue about the rejection of the law, will be likely Paul Clement, who has served as general supplicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The legal office of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of the two dozen offices that have helped Federalist (Federalist Society), a group of long date dedicated to defend the conservative legal principles, to sponsor the annual dinner of the Society.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another office that has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that have contested the law, the national Federation of the independent firms (National Federation of Independent Business).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another promoter has been the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presents an enormous financial stake in the result of the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner has been held at a Washington hotel some hours after the conference of the court on the business.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was there, between others, Mitch McConnell, republican beep of the Senate and adversary declared of the health of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests celebrity to the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is not new: the two judges have been present to the events of the Federalist Society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is not anything that goes contrary to the rules from deontology.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actually, the judges are exempted from code of behavior that governs the actions of the federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they were it, they would argue no doubt by the code of Canon 4C, which stipulates: "A judge can attend collections of fund of the organizations related to the right and other although the judge can not be a participant, a guest of honor, or extra on the program of such an event".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the office of lawyers of the business, as to a firm having a massive financial interest, has sufficed to alarm the activists of the governmental ethics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This violation of the ethical and superb one indifference with regard to the code contradicts the declarations from several judges that the Court respects the same applicable rules to all the other federal judges", has declared Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges drank and dined and to a collection of fund of gala with lawyers that have cases in authority in front of the court".</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and their participation to the collection of fund of this event takes apart every complaint of impartiality, and is unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little consideration for the criticisms maintaining that they mix too much easily the businesses of the court with the agenda of such groups that the Society Federalist.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the woman of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative militant of top-profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Besides, the conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan that has a problem of ethics, both not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan has been a general supplicant of the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law have been carried at the level of the county court.</seg>
<seg id="25">His criticisms have made pressure so that Kagan refuses to give an opinion to hear the case, saying about the law that she had too much given itself into the defense to be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan has not given any indication that it would make it.</seg>

<seg id="3">Boeing sells also six Boeing Dreamliners at Oman Air, a market valued at more than a billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">There is not anything extraordinary to what a company receives a command contemplating 50 of his products.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is on the other hand a whole business while the company in question is the builder of airplanes Boeing and that the amount of these 50 airplanes affects the record sum of 18 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Tout aussi incredible is of whom Boeing has received this command: the Middle East, a gold mine magnifying future commands of airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="7">In forecasts published Monday, the company of Chicago considers that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the 20 next years of 2 520 airplanes of a total value of 450 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In the course of the weekend, Boeing has informed of the command of commercial airplanes the most expensive of his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai that has passed this Pharaonic command.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boeing has announced to the Lounge Aeronautics of Dubai of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 airplanes furthermore, what would put up the total amount of the command at 26 billion dollars.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the Middle East, the producing countries of oil possess many of their airlines.</seg>
<seg id="16">They have therefore not only the means of paying these airplanes, but an ascent of the price of the fuel - in a usual way prejudicial for the airlines because it does not represent their most important expenses - would not be them so harmful since the country earned money with the ascent of the price of the oil.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is an important point because these companies will be less susceptible than of others of canceling or of deferring their commands of airplanes while the price of the oil increases, has signaled Dihora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"They have a natural blanket of risk", it has said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The command d'Emirates reinforces the predominance of Boeing on the market of the jumbo jet airplanes and helps Airbus to slow down the attempt of encroachment of the competitor with his airplane A350.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Severe warnings of the Pentagon on the potential reductions of the defense</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Secretary to the Defense, Leon Panetta, has made the pressure on the Conference go up Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget compressions would sap the national safety. It has started a financial chain reaction of the corridors of the Pentagon at the battlefields of Afghanistan, passing by the unions from civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon digests already 450 billion dollars of reductions for the next decade, but He fears now that an additional amount of 600 dollars or more compressions is imminent if the Conference does not get to an agreement on the expenses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry", has declared Panetta in a letter to the Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He has declared that the failure of the Conference to get to a budget agreement resulting as far as one calls the confinement, would take 23% of reductions as the frost of numerous new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"A so important reduction, applied thus without discernment, would not give back most of our ships and of our impractical projects of building - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or of a building - and to undermine seriously to the other efforts of modernization", writes Panetta to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We would be also forces to separate ourselves from some number of our civil staff and, because the reduction was imposed so rapidly, nearly probably we should send civilians in leave without salary with a view to reaching the objective."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes would undermine the faith of those that support our servicemen and would damage our preparation seriously."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The reductions would touch possibly the combatant troops, continues Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Although the financing in time of war of the accounts of the operations of contingency abroad is directly not touched by the confinement, the efforts of war negatively would be affected by the serious disruptions in the budgets of base ", has warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The contracting staff would be reduced, taking delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract that support the war".</seg>
<seg id="12">"The staff managing the salaries would be reduced, taking delays of payment to the purveyors of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written days to Panetta 10 earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequence of a confinement on the department of the Defense would have would start a fast decline of the United States as uncontested world leader of the military power".</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are shyly opposite to this draconian action", have declared the senators in a common communiqué Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter of Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is probably not the one that we should impose to ourselves".</seg>
<seg id="17">"The confinement is a threat for the interests of national safety of the United States, and it should not have to happen".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been more and more virulent about the possible compressions, even if it has arrived himself to the highest posts of the Pentagon accumulating years of expert evaluation of the budget to the Conference and the White House and knowing that it was confronted with difficult choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">To a past press conference the week, the secretary to the Defense has painted a dark picture of what could appear - a serviceman with a shell, but not of kernel.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors".</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a squad without balls".</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is an interceptor, without enough formed pilots".</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a tiger in paper, an army of barracks, of buildings and of bombs that do not have enough formed soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission", has declared Panetta during his remarks preliminary to the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a depressed strength, badly prepared and incapable of making opposite potential adversaries".</seg>
<seg id="26">"De facto, it induces to the agression.."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has stated specifically how new reductions could generate important operational risks: deadline of reply to the crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits at our capacity for spreading out and starting in the world; and unacceptable accepted risk in operations of future fighting".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta has declared that certain of the greatest projects of defense could pass to the cleaver, including those already tested and certain just to the first stadiums of the planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new predicted bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new ship of coastal fighting and the new vehicle of ground, which would replace the Humvee of the army and of the navy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Putting a term to the development and to the testings of the F35 could generate 80 billion dollars of economics towards 10 years, but his partisans say that it is an essential stage about improvement and about reply to the potential threats of China and of other rivals.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How to spot a lie</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A glance on the recent headlines indicates at what point the deceit and the lie are omnipresent in the daily life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is busy with exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; every side accusing the other one of lying.</seg>
<seg id="4">The administrators of Penn State have been marked of perjury to allegedly have covered relations according to which a trainer of football to the retirement has attacked boys sexually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been taken on by an asserting open microphone to the American president Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The member of the Conference of New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has been taken for an idiot emitting rapidly denials contradicted by irrefutable proofs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The previous candidate to the presidential one John Edwards has been marked of violations of the financing of the campaigns related to the blanket of an extramarital link.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then, none of the one that has lived the history will ever forget the media circus that the president Bill Clinton has started lying during his second mandate on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The stories of cheating to the tests of the school and of the university are a legion.</seg>
<seg id="11">There have been cases where the teachers have given the students the replies of the tests in order to be made well see on their evaluations of performance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The mentors that should teach the opposite send the message according to which lie and the cheating are satisfactory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much deceit do we meet?</seg>
<seg id="14">Towards a given day, the studies show that you can hear of 10 to 200 lies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actually, many of these are pious lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study has shown that the foreigners lie themselves to three resumptions in the 10 first minutes of their meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">To detect or to spot lies is an essential ability that each must acquire, at the same time for personal and professional reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a similar boardgame to, let's say, of the riddles, where the objective is of exclaiming: "I have had you", the detection of the deceit is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data gathered in the course of the six last decades in prestigious universities having led a research in depth such projects, notably in psychology and in physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the search results is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.</seg>
<seg id="20">The liars look at you in the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do not stammer, blush or do always not fidget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Not to conclude only the liars is difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.</seg>
<seg id="23">A detector of qualified lie can discover the truth examining the structure of the declaration, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of reply.</seg>
<seg id="24">I have passed several years to examine scientific results in the vast body and always emergent from the knowledge on the deceit, and it is clear that the detection of the deceit is a modern ability that is easy-to-learn and useful to sail in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include notably the hiring, the meetings, the negotiation or the management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liars are skillful at well reading the others, taking them comfortably, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how the others perceive them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know of after investigations that the extroverts lie more that the introverts, what the men to call more lies "centered on them" even though the women say more lies "centered on the others" - usually to protect the feelings from somebody that the married people lie less often to their partners than the people not married (but that the lies that they tell have tendency to be enormous).</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a heathen, the others are going to feel less culprit of lying to you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How can you say if anybody lies?</seg>
<seg id="29">First and Foremost, observe the normal behavior of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is what one calls "to establish the mark data".</seg>
<seg id="31">That helps to supply a reference point to measure the ulterior changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Observe the posture of your subject, the laugh, the vocal quality.</seg>
<seg id="33">You must know if somebody moves in a normal way his feet permanently in order to not launch unfair accusations when you see it move the feet in the middle of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then search for clues of verbal and not verbal deceitful behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these clues as red flags, not of the proofs of the deceit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The deceitful people can immobilize the top of the body while they try to remember their history, they can point their feet at the door, bend themselves to an exit, change posture in a significant way or present a relief of "post-interview" - one exaggerated sigh of relief, one change of posture when all the difficult questions are past.</seg>
<seg id="37">The interrogators indicate often that the maintenance is just finished to try to start the post-interview reaction fakely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also, mind the vocabulary of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">The famous Scott Peterson has veered using the past all claiming that his murdered woman was alive, starting a national research to find it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The deceitful individuals can also use an outdistanced language: "I have not had sexual relationships with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or to repeat entirely a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most common verbal indicators are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Somebody can use much of "language of wood" during his reply to a difficult question: "Eh well... for true statement... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="43">That makes the reply perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is not magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of the abilities to recognize the deceit is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These abilities will improve the chances of whom of avoiding the victimisation by swindlers in their professional and personal life.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Some days after the administration of Obama has threatened to delay the approval of a project of pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - arousing the anger of the unions all appeasing the environmentalists - the society trying to build the pipeline says that it is ready to relead the project to replace it on the rails.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">TransCanada has declared Monday night that it is going to move the pipeline thrown out of the ecologically sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project all the same is going to win his approval.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The society has announced the decision during a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="5">The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, maintains that the company remains confident that it will end up obtaining the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">That makes with reference to the announcement by the Department of State the last week that it would delay of a license his decision of concession federal for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes allowing avoiding the zones of the dunes of Nebraska and of the aquifer Ogallala, of vast underground sources of water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"It is a real way vers l'avant", indicates Lee Terry, a republican of Nebraska in Fox News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new examination of the environment ordered by the Department of State would probably have rejected every decision up to 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama, in a declaration written the last week, has described the decision as being the decision of the Department of State, and it expressed his support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The pipeline of 2.735 km would spread from Canada to the gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would transport 700.000 barrels by day for of the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">For it to make, it would need to cross six States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is hated by the ecologists, but he is loved by groups of work, which have bet on the 20 000 jobs valued related to the pipeline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the legislators of Nebraska opposite to this plan make pressure that a law for strength the removal from the region of Sand Hills and of the aquifer Ogallala, a major source of drinking water and of irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The environmental study of impact in the process of the Department of State has thought that the project would put only limited negative environmental impacts, but the industry of the energy has declared that the general inspector of the ministry has organized an inquiry distinct from the process of examination, centered on two questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One is that a lobbyiste hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser of campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other one is of to know if a firm that has been hired to lead the initial study has been an inappropriate choice throughout his relationship to TransCanada.</seg>

<seg id="1">The climatic adversity has slowed down the economics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, at Sinaloa the unemployment and the informalité have increased, the foreign investment has lowered and the economics has contracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">2011 is a year of which one will remember Sinaloa in the economic history, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called of the change, which has generated great expectations in what concerns the advances of the economics, but being given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange it is one deterioration of the main indicators of the economic development.</seg>
<seg id="4">The low temperatures of the February, apart from of talking about the losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the economics of the State for the growth, have caused a contraction of the economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first semester of the year, justified by the historical one principally fall of 31.16 percent in the agriculture, that has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the relation of allocations by the frosts stemming by the Mexican Advice of Development Rural Tenable, there have been damages of 582 million 835 cultured hectares, of which one 78.03 percent have suffered of the damages total and the rest of 21.07 percent have suffered from the partial damages, the main disaster-stricken cultures have been the vegetables, the corn and the chick pea.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fall of the economic activity has generated, until in November, a constant rise of the unemployment in the State, according to the Institute National of Statistic and Geography the unemployment rate of the State for the three first terms of the year one has observed a rise accelerated, because while of the January March 55 a thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed persons, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economic Population Is Activated, in the second term the rate has become 5.28 percent and of the July September the average has continued raise up to to the 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 a thousand sinaloens unemployed persons, a rise in relation to the first semester of 18 a thousand 969 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Less liquidity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The unemployment to Sinaloa for the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, manager of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise of the unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the realized actions by the public policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What one observes it is a rise of the unemployment that diverse factors is owed, among which the loss of liquidity on the market owed to a restriction of the resources by the legislation approved of in the Conference to fight the laundering of money, because for the people who win of the dollars in an illicit way it is not easy that they work to win them, that they surround them and use them in something", it says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Held migration</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">López Cervantes has notified a demographic factor that the rise of the unemployment is also owed.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The number of people who abandon the State to go to work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because going they have already many difficulties to take on work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, it that makes that the unemployment raises," has declared-you him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Lack of seriousness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The analysis of the sinaloen market of work deteriorates considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between the conditions of work, according to the INEGI, the 60.38 percent of the population occupied in this state works without subscribing as worker by any institution of social assurance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason of interval for the state are the low salaries, the entity has the lower remunerations of the Country, according to the registers of the Institute Mexicain of Social Assurances and the Secretariat of Work and Social Forecasting.</seg>
<seg id="16">The average monthly incomes of the sinaloens workers has been, until September, 5 a thousand 352 pesos, very inferior to the national average, which is located to 7 a thousand 375 pesos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Contraction of IED</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Apart from fall of the economic activity and the rise of the unemployment, in 2011 one has recorded the strongest reduction of the Direct Foreign Investment of the 10 last years, according to the Secretariat of Economics from January to June the IED of the State has reached 630 a thousand 697 dollars, what represents a fall of the 87.74 percent in relation to the 5 million 143 a thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same one period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Successively, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State counts a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per annum, recorded by the companies of the service sector principally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The debt</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Being given the script of economic contraction, the Government of the State has solicited in July to the public conference the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, destined for the investment in projects of infrastructure in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economics, the approval of the conference of the State has been of 2,600 trillion pesos and until November one has not observed any profit of the indebtedness in any sector of the economics of the State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Reactions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of capacity of management of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="24">Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Bedroom of the Industry of Transformation, has declared that in 2011 there has not been a harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, ci-inclus the Government of the State.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Court validates "the analogical break" in Mexico in 2015</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The substitution of the signal analogical by the digitalises is one of the more important exchanges than the world has suffered the last years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The High Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has nonsuited the constitutional controversies that the Senat and Parliament have stated against the presidential decree that brings forward the one said "analogical break" of 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, ci-inclus the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, has considered that the president Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his attributions while it has issued the decree that details the actions to follow to realize the transition on television land digitalis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, has been nonsuited for not to have not reached the majority described as eight vote so that the Court gives an opinion on the constitutionalité or non constitutionalité of the decree, and this continues be in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The project of sentence, elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, has proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because of the fact that the rules as regards radio and television are an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in fine of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reserve of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">On account of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even have voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">With this argument, so much the Senate as Parliament have promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree and admitting the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions foreseen by this for the digital transition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The plenary of the ministers has solved to nonsuit also the complaint stated by Parliament, without discussing the project whose minister Sánchez Cordero is as responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In his intervention, the president minister has said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive can not structure through general norms measure them so that the public administration gets ready for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Neither I do not consider that if it made it one would feign the autonomy of the regulating organ", and it has reminded that the planning of the public policies in strategic domains as the sector of the telecommunications is the responsibility of the federal Executive, which has the direction of the State as constitutional mandate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The substitution of the signal analogical by of the signal digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the latter years and that is translated in a better exploitation of the radio ghost, a better quality of the signal and more chains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Adjourning the change, has supported-you-him, would be to adjourn the profits of the digitalization that implies a decision of public interest that does not have a technical dimension only, "because that includes also economic, social, political questions and national safety".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">These questions, has underlined-you-him, "require the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution grants Executive of the State to the faculty".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It has reminded that a great number of countries of everybody have already finished the digital transition and they have made it through Executive, in spite of the fact that they had the loudly specialized technical organs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One can not conclude that the Executive, issuing the contested decree, has invaded of a form the sphere of abilities of the Conference, because it assures in the administrative sphere the respect of the issued laws by the Legislative, it assured.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The total deduction of the ballot can be fulfilled also if at the end of the common deduction it results from percentage that the difference between the winning supposed candidate and that of the second place is equal or inferior to a point, to condition of that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has gone out second, case in which one will exclude the electoral packets that have been an object from the partial deduction.</seg>

<seg id="7">That day will appear on the National Stadium, from the 19:30 hours, beside the group of Los Angeles The X and the national ones of Las Robertas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">That is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in La Nación on Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For his costariciens followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream become reality. Are you conscious of what your fans live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us also.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is our second time in South America and Central and until now that has been grandiose.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have spent in Costa Rica only a time the vacations; it is a so beautiful country and I think that we will be able to spend some days.</seg>
<seg id="13">It moves us therefore to carry our music over there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask for you, because there is a kind of devoutness to the group, the fans live the previous days with intensity.</seg>
<seg id="15">What is your message for your most fervent followers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank-you of remaining beside us during everyone these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">Him have needed 21 years so that we arrive to Costa Rica; thank-you of having waited for so much and we are sorry of the fact that so much time has had to pass up to this concert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people say already about the year that his concert is the greater show.</seg>
<seg id="19">Does that add a little pressure to your visit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the greater shows that we have offered for the last 21 years have taken place in the two last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have offered one two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are really very impatient to produce us on it.</seg>
<seg id="23">We like this country, we love to make surfing and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How have you discovered Costa Rica and his waves to make surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have many surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives at Tamarindo and the waves are incredible over there.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends went always to make surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, to quoted of Mexico, are great places to make surfing; it is as we have learned it, through the gents that like the surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Seeing the round, you offered aves of the enormous shows, with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As we have never happened over there, we do not have any restriction in what concerns what we can make.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to make the best show possible, with a great variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of every album and to offer our fans a good and diverse notebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat the notebook.</seg>
<seg id="32">At what is that owed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe that it is partially because we have nine disks and can interpret more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, it is for that that it is very difficult to choose what songs to interpret every evening.</seg>
<seg id="34">While we have two or three songs in the notebook that we have not interpreted anymore for very long, that helps to us to remain concentrated and surprises us because that reminds us the reasons for which we like these songs and that we can have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">That fact that the show is more interesting for us and consequently I think that it also becomes more interesting for the people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this round, you celebrate 20 years of path.</seg>
<seg id="37">Looking backward, is believing all what you have succeeded at difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">In first place, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a great rock group, and the fact that we have made it for more than 20 years fact that that seems a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We continue tell our benedictions and the fact of being able continue play music together moves us much.</seg>
<seg id="41">We love ourselves and we adore to create music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky of to go to places of the world to which always we have wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">The things could not go better for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">That means for you makes it of having been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Forming part of this group of great groups has been always an honor for us.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is amazing while a movement arises of a group of friends and is little common.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, a group arises of a city, but it is much stranger while five or ten groups go out at the same time of the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and forming part of the group of Seattle is an honor for us.</seg>
<seg id="50">We play still with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">The past year we have participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen to Soundgarden in their round, therefore we are lucky of being still friendly with all them and it is an honor for us to form part of this sound of Seattle that has arises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is as very strange as a group as the your is maintained itself uni and with the same members for so much time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us have been a unity for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is a lot more time that many groups owed in a normal way.</seg>
<seg id="54">In first place, I believe that we are everyone lucky of being still in life and, in second place, we worry everyone for the others.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all personal friends and grace has that it is of the musical boulevards that give freedom to each of experimenting.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have trust ones in the others with the music of each and that could not go better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with the celebrity word has not been easy; though, thanks to your success, you have been able to make what you want.</seg>
<seg id="58">How do you find a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we have grown, that has been easier for us of finding a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We check on the fact that we do not spend too much time in round because beating in this game great multitudes and people who like your music is easy.</seg>
<seg id="61">If one does not forget that the people are there for the music, that us help to not to forget that the music must be respected and it that has brought it, without putting itself in mind the fact that one is famous and a star rock, what does not interest really in any of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think that we have written good songs and initially that has been grandiose.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have been a group nearly for three years and we have not published a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">There have been many frustrations for the fact that it has lasted so little and the most important is makes it that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that have begun in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think to the incredible person that Andy has been and how it made me laugh, that it has been always a pleasure of working, laugh, to talk music, football and a lot autres things with it.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was an amazing human being and we miss it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen it for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production has sent videos to us with different suggestions and that has been the group that we have loved the most, therefore we are impatient to see it that Las Robertas can offer en direct and that must be very entertaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">For what do you change always the words from Yello Ledbetter en direct?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), therefore I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">It is it that sings it and I believe that it makes it with the first words that he imagines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">As bass player, what are his influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">There is so much...</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the first of which I remember it is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, against J. Sweeps, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many influences that I could speak all of it the afternoon on the bass players that I adore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has succeeded Pearl Jam has to maintain raising the grunge in spite of the fact that this is not no more in fashion?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I believe that us all we feel a bit disconnected of the grunge word.</seg>
<seg id="79">While I think some, that reminds the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have to me arises at the same time and, if that is raising now, I believe that that is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth the trouble to listen and the groups as Mudhoney make now the best music that never.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Initially, his music had some darker contents and now this has become more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">At what is this change owed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem slighter, but there are also songs, as The End yet Just Breathe described as songs very dark, even if these can ring a little positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With the two of them, when Ed has played them for me, I have cried when I have listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think that if you grow and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friendly, these things start influencing your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">I also think that one can also be happy and even so one can play music dark.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects coincide on the opportunity of the summoning beyond the debate on the fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">To the environment of the years '80, in full apogee of the déjà-éteinte Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed affichettes of promotion of Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona subway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furthermore, it contained also a comparison, in numbers, with the Central one Park of New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the imagination of many people, limits it superior of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the alone that does not direct on the north-south axis, otherwise top (mountain) - bottom (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The qualification of Collserola as natural park is to the advantage of this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was not anymore Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with boars in the role of the Yogi bear.</seg>
<seg id="10">That was the situation until, in September, the town hall has convoked a mega-competition composed by 16 compete for all the doors of access to Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door replaces in the idea of park, undoubtedly.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is that, or well somebody wants to put doors at the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">The apparait question very alone: Collserola: park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The competition, so much in what concerns his organization as in what concerns the thought on the city is a theme of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is nearly a recurrent theme that two members of this old caste of elected representatives talk while they recognize themselves in an elevator about.</seg>
<seg id="16">And that is precisely one of the rare opinions on which three architects of Barcelona, academic teachers, coincide that have appeared to it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán, after approaching the forehead littoral "it is essentials of" to discuss on "the forehead mountain" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the city blocks green has not been led at end.</seg>
<seg id="19">"One" must leave from the base that the vaster park of Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things for his great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex", has fallen the verdict the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" contains one "trap lexicon": these does not need to think "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some zones in which it is needed to act".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies the suggestion as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".</seg>
<seg id="23">Of the perils that are derived of "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in the years '80 and that has had in the zone of the Forum "his singing of swan".</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Limiting something means to establish already the step in accordance with", in other words, his overtaking.</seg>
<seg id="26">"One must think about new urbanistic instruments, of planning, because the present ones [with reference to the Plan General Métropolitain (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Being held more to the question, Modol has an opinion that, simplifying, the side of the region El Valles of Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol reminds that there is already a work done by the Employers of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to her corporation of intervening in this project "from the first moment".</seg>
<seg id="29">Furthermore, he understands that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that allows the architects to enter to the debate, but "doubts" if it shapes technique must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a whole success", it says) that one has of the to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona insinuates that the reply to the question that gives the title of this part is complex, because from the bases of the competition he misses a global vision of Collserola: "One has convoked 16 transverse competitions - dit-il - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is not a longitudinal reading that sees and understands the zone in his unity".</seg>
<seg id="31">This makes, at least in that case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the gang immediately superior to that of Ronda of Dalt should foresee, in all his stretching, a zone of equipment that carries out a sweet transition between the city and the green.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) has informed that the results brought to the fore on the accident in which his life the secretary of Government has lost, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try an emergency landing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, has mentioned that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot has noticed that the conditions of climate were appropriate to fly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The elements that seem to indicate that the unity has had diverse contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unity has lost the fuselage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It has informed also of the fact that the unity was conceived for 19 people, therefore this satisfied the particularities necessary to transport the staff.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furthermore, it has said that the investigations made in the zone of impacte do not bring back the appearance of parts to the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"In a research one has reported that there are not parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has appeared in a structural way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"The helicopter had been conceived for 19 passengers and satisfied the particularities to transport them.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ground presented a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is of having the results the more in a fast way possible; but the investigation can last some months, it can even last a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Successively, Gilberto López Meyer, chief executive officer of Airports and Auxiliary Services has assured that the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State worked quickly of cruiser and that has happened on a rising soft ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This information supports the hypothesis of a working normal cruiser at the moment of impacte it", it says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">During the press conference, the SCT Pérez Jácome holder has enumerated six important elements in the investigation:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Visual flight:</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the aeronautical normative one, the flight has been realized according to the rules of the visual flight, what implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and to the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Meteorological conditions:</seg>
<seg id="17">The relations in the AICM mentioned conditions appropriate to the takeoff, and to the fur and as the aircraft advanced to the bordering zone between DF and the State of Mexico there were coats of nebulosity to weak height.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Selected roads:</seg>
<seg id="19">It is probable qu"à cause of the conditions of nebulosity the crew has looked a weaker zone of height and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Location of impacte it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coordinates of impacte it and the last recording of the aircraft on the coincident radar, probably before impacte it it has not been neither loss of the control nor alteration of the path of flight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Scattering of the rests of the aircraft in a reduced zone:</seg>
<seg id="23">The available information until now allows of to require that impacte it has place taken on a right and side path.</seg>
<seg id="24">The model of scattering of the rests of the aircraft allows supposing that the helicopter has collided with the ground in conditions of structural integrity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">One has not detected traces of fire or of explosion:</seg>
<seg id="26">In the place of the accident there is not always any trace in the rests of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.</seg>
<seg id="27">The last results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had numerous contacts with the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">During the works of ground one has found parts of the aircraft to a height of 9 a thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground presented a slope that goes for seven derig at 30 degrees of inclination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The photographs show the sequence in which maybe it has dismantled at the length of his journey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The information supplies elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter can have had of the impactes multiples with the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">After the meticulous research in a zone roomier than the place encircled, around the accident, one has not found parts disperse of the aircraft, what supports the presumption of that the impact has taken place in conditions of structural integrity.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Institute Mexicain of Social Assurance (IMSS) has announced that it leads an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in the case of children and youths, called protocol 'Genetics of the obesity of the children and adolescents' that will allow having the markers associated with the excess weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In a communiqué, the leader of the Unity of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, has explained that one had formed one multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and attend social.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team is pressed by specialists and students of third cycle of the Institute National of Public Health (INSP) and of the Center of Investigation and of Studies Brought Forward (Cinvestav) from the Institute Polytechnique National (IPN).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To the investigation one induces to participate the population having or not right, to present itself to the unity participant sportswomen of the IMSS to Valle of México, where are carried out the proofs to the minors every Saturday to leave of 8:00 hours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It has underlined that the protocol has begun Cuauhtémoc (Estado of México Poniente) in the Sport Unity and that from October 8th, the activity takes place in the Sport Unity of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado of México Oriente).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">After having reached the objective of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sport Unity Independencia (to the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sport Unity Morelos (to the north of Distrito Federal).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It has explained that the objective of this investigation and that e connaitre the components and the importance of the genetics in what concerns the development of the obesity and of identifying by the children and young Mexican of the factors of risk to warn the appearance of the chronic degenerative illnesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">As one will celebrate on November 14th on the World Day of the Diabetes, he has mentioned that the objective is that of gathering three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the surveillance of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relative to the feeding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They will also be asked for on their physical activity and their antecedents of family heredity of their illnesses, to avoid the factors of risk that start affections as the diabetes or the renal shortage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">He has detailed that the Saturdays one will apply to all the participants of the anthropometric measurings (weight, size, circumference of the size), arterial pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (one tries to identify the associated people with the infantile obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz López has notified that this investigation is the fruit of the worry of the professionals of the health for the alarming capture of weight in the case of the minors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">'The inquiries of health of 1999 and 2006 have notified that only in six years there has been a rise, in the case of the boys, of the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of the girls of the 47 percent; in what concerns the excess weight one has observed also a dramatic rise', underlined the specialist of the IMSS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It has indicated that the justification for the research of the markers is based in the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by his genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He has informed that on average, the Mexican ones have one 65 percent of indo-américaine heredity, one 30 percent European and one five percent African and this condition is reflected in the associated people to the diabetes and excess weight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">It has explained that in general, the genetics of the obesity is translated in the inability from bruler the excess of energy that one consumes (calories), which settles under the form of fat.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors hand it over by written language to the parents, to whom one explains each of the measures and changes in the way of life that they must realize to warn the illnesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz López has explained that there are three main components that cause excess weight, obesity and of other chronic affections: the sédentarisme, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to remain the majority of the day sat in front the telly and to use means of transport instead of going on foot on short distances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another cause is the high caloric contribution, in other words the greatest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - pâté of meat at the cornflour wrapped in leaves of corn -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a top contained from fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.</seg>

<seg id="1">The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to cause a mixture with a better yield, independently of the conditions environmental and of temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If signal them that the cobblestone were solved, it would not be no more necessary to repair 200 about a thousand blackcurrants every season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who has assured that if the process of building and maintenance of the bituminous cobblestone is appropriate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">During his conference A technological opinion about the blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of the Chemistry, it has announced that the laboratory of which it is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to cause a mixture having similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, so much to high as low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera has considered that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places in which the climate is heat, as some cities of the north of the country, extremely to improve the yield, and consequently, the training of the blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It has explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a unity of molecules of hydrocarbons, of the molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltènes, and of the molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, that unity give to the cobblestone her characteristic behavior viscoélastique.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The viscoélastique behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of nearly 180 degrees, comprises as a liquid, at 120 degrees C his viscosity is very big and at 50 degrees C it presents a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, it added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">That means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not regular and is altered for the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researcher of the FQ has observed that the streets of Ciudad of México in their majority were covered by a flexible cobblestone, compound of six coats of materials, the three last ones of which imply the asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the more superficial coats finds itself the coat of asphalt, formed by small stones soaked in asphalt and compacted ulteriorly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each of the small stones that forms the coat, it signaled, is bathed year asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the vehicles pass generating efforts, this lets the strengths spread very well in the cobblestone.</seg>
<seg id="13">If one had modified asphalt, these would spread better, had an opinion to strive it chemical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the coat of asphalt, it says, one puts a last coat called coat of rotation, made in thin stone, in other words, of the sand that is also soaked in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As this is the coat in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more de force mechanics than the coat of asphalt and supply adherence in the street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Being the part of the cobblestone that receives and distribute the efforts, the coat of rotation also requires that this has an appropriate thickness and the material of which it is made must be looked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The climate, especially the dampness and the variations of temperature, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, it says, because these affect considerably the yield of the coat of asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">While the ground wets itself, the water spreads inside the coat is it is difficult that this goes out, it that soft all the coats of the cobblestone and consequently cause of the blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the trial of training of a blackcurrant, it says, the first who is wasted is the film of rotation and only ulteriorly is affected the coat of asphalt, but the shame does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be cured to the first signals with appropriate programs of maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member of the National System of the Researchers has explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the training of blackcurrant and consequently the thickness of every coat of the cobblestone must always be bound pending vehicles and to guarantee his satisfaction, to avoid the frequent training of blackcurrant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera has warned of it being still a lot to investigate and to work the bituminous emulsions on the asphalt, for example, which in other countries exist already on the market and allow repairing the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="15">And for everybody, read please a little, "The small prince" is a great book"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Between the launched hypotheses there is that according to which Valle has been destroyed by the favoritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist of Bogotá has insinuated that being the favorite, the one given an ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prices (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best artisanal suit, and Queen Mother), "that has wakened the jealousy of the other candidates, has stressed out the queen and" it is not "for that" that it has not sparkled on the scene".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And one has noted that down in his first presentation in swimsuit at the beach of Hilton and his two processions of the eve of the coronation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if to the two processions it had seemed sure about it even, one has noticed that it did not have the strength and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como put up some" (as at home), of the Canal RCN has declared that is it that Melina had been referred to princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains the majority from the prices during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".</seg>
<seg id="21">Furthermore, Valle has avoided the press in the end, and that has been one mistake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis it is that Valle has not succeeded in convincing the jury on his interest in the social initiatives, which is the gasoline of the National Competition of Beauty in fact.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is for that that two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty has declared that they looked for a woman engaged in what concerns the social necessities of his country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Only the beauty is not sufficient at a Colombia Beauty Queen, it is needed to look beyond the appearance and to base itself on his social sensibility, that before beginning the Competition projects are already involved in", it explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">One speculates also that Valle has erred through his defects of his bottom and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but that is contradictory, because precisely the jury has elected him as the candidate 'natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good feeding and responsible physical work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The assistant of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco reconnait that Melina did not have the best body, that him in had best, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, that in reality for me had not been too notorious, has left it points last day".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the review Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle have been the surgical interventions that it had undergone.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The surgeries are good, but Valle has not known to make them.</seg>
<seg id="29">His body has never been his asset and it has lost because of this aspect".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For this price, which the National Competition of Beauty replaces for the first time, after the procession in swimsuit has arises one cruel prediction that has been fulfilled yesterday night, one said that that it was a small present that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste about the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, otherwise as princess, a position that gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">Though, it will go by in the history as one of the queens that in spite of his dazzling passage by Cartagena, has not obtained the crown.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thus has been the work of the person of Cali that has identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A dactyloscopiste of Cali has passed to the history as the man who has confirmed the death of 'Alfonso Cano'.</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these officials is crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste of the CTI of Cali has passed to the history as the person who has confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven dactyloscopistes that work places of the CTI in the offices, this week it was up to 'availability' of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada that works for 21 years in the domain of judicial investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, González has worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he has had to spend more than five days in the forest to happen to the place in which the corpses were than had to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The year 2000 it has become transferred to the capital of Valle and after having follows appropriate lessons, it has specialized in fingerprinting methods, which are the study of the skin of friction, in other words the palms and the feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">For the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano one had warned to Eliazar of taking clothes at least with it for three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Something very big waited for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Friday the night he has left for Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew that it had to identify two corpses and that one suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the guérrilla older of the world, consequently one has asked to him to take itself the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But while it has arrived with the team of investigation to the place of the corpse, it has not pleaded it by his aspect physical, because this was very different from the one that he had seen in the medium.</seg>
<seg id="13">It did not have beard, it was dressed as a farmer of the zone, without glasses and much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the imprints do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accompanied by a galtonienne magnifying glass, from the ink, a préleveur and a lantern, Eliazar has compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.</seg>
<seg id="16">His eye has not deceived it not: it was a matter of "Alfonso Cano".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This same night, the man originating from Puerto Tejada has been the person in charge that has confirmed to the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was a matter of the supreme leader of the Farc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In search of the imprint</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali the gratitude that the president Juan Manuel Santos has made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people of connait not our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fingerprinting methods are an exact science, without margin of mistake, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Apart from of identifying the corpses, the dactyloscopistes press the investigations for the offenses as the flight and the homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people.</seg>
<seg id="23">When are captured, many delinquents present fake identity cards or do not have documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">We take their fingerprints and look for them in the data base.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The researcher has related that in a case of flight it has had to take a part off wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to make to take out a safe full of jewels and of the money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get out a fingerprint, but in that case we have been able to obtain the imprint from the whole hand and to identify with the delinquent who had participated in different flights", he remembers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The imprints can also discard or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lately one has found a man died, with bottles of drink around it.</seg>
<seg id="29">By interlude of the investigation one has determined that a parent can be a suspect of the crime and an imprint indeed on the bottle coincided.</seg>
<seg id="30">That no does not guarantee that he is the murderer, that puts it on the scene of the crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A dactyloscopiste of the CTI has explained that one extracts "the fingerprints from the objects with chemical or physical reagents".</seg>
<seg id="32">While they appear, one uses a préleveur or a gang to remove them.</seg>
<seg id="33">Subsequently, the imprints are sent to Asif, the data base of the déclinquents, or to the National Civil Register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The problem is that it is still much of Colombian undocumented", indicated the expert of the CTI.</seg>
<seg id="35">It has explained that everything is not how one shows in the program of television CSI.</seg>
<seg id="36">As all what sparkles is not gold, all that one touches does not become forcing an imprint.</seg>
<seg id="37">It can be used though, if one realizes the necessary confrontation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Since the month of March the Japanese economics was paralyzed, convalescent still after the devastating one earthquake that has become nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the Japanese country for the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first appraisals of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the material losses at 300.000 million dollars, a blow that, in spite of the difficult world context, seems to have died down.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive terms of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have served to turn the page definitively: the GDP has raised a 1,5% in relation to the previous term and a 6% in annualized rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="10">That could be translated by modifications at the treaty of Lisbon allowing reinforcing the control of the European Union on the budget policies of the countries of the euro zone, but that could also lead on to the election of the president of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".</seg>

<seg id="14">Similarly, the delegates have thrown back to an overwhelming majority the suggestion of balancing the weight of every country to the board of directors of the European Central Bank according to the weight of every economics, it that evidently came back to reinforce the weight of Germany.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">That represents the fraud to the stoppings illness?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the stoppings illness.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November in Bordeaux 15th to visit a crate of family allocations, and to pronounce a speech on the theme - recurrent for 2007 - of the fight against the social frauds and the assistantship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And to accompany this offensive, which leaves of a will of saving money in a context of rigor, but is not an annonciatrice of an axis of the presidential campaign less on the right, the majority wants to concentrate on the stoppings illness.</seg>
<seg id="5">First in a goal of budget economics: the government plans to impose private sector to the wage earners a fourth day of deficiency before the responsibility of a stoppage of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In light, without agreement of specific firm, a wage earner who falls ill would lose four days of salary, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A measure that risks to arouse anger, but that would allow bringing back 280 million euros, according to The Echoes.</seg>
<seg id="8">And who would be accompanied from another measure, of more symbolic range: imposing to the officials a day of deficiency not indemnified in the event of stoppage of work (they do not have so far not grace period, against three days in the private sector).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Even though these questions are under discussion, the majority relaunchs also the themes of the frauds, targeting this time the abuses related to the stoppages of work.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The controls are going to be much more important and, besides, if you are taken on, you will reimburse, has warned Xavier Bertrand to the microphone of RTL, Sunday, November 13th.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As for other cases, the effects of announcement seem about little disproportioned with the reality of the frauds to the stoppages of work.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is indeed the subject for 2002 of a constant follow-up and of offensive policies, which have the most often carried their fruits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French not iller that elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Let's delay us first on the national numbers.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the national Crate of illness assurance (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensations have been issued in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the Institute of research and of documentation in economics of the health, the daily compensations represented as 2008 5 % of the expenses of health, with 11,3 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">On this sum, 46% concerned the leaves maternity and industrial injuries, and 54% concerned the stoppings illness, or 6,2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">And therefore 2,5% of the expenses of health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French have known on average 14.5 days of stoppage of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Alma Consulting.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average that hides certain gaps: another inquiry, published in 2007 by the site of management of career Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40 000 questioned French wage earners said not to have taken any day of illness stopping.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time of the illness Assurance, clarifies that in 2010, 37% of the stoppings illness were of a duration inferior to 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days at a month, 15% of one to three month and 11% au-delà.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When one compares them with their European neighbors, the French wage earners are not more prone than elsewhere to the stoppages of work.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long study led in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence (for reasons of health or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% at the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud to the stoppings illness represents very little in view of the moonlighting.</seg>
<seg id="25">As for the fraud, it reaches only a weak extent.</seg>
<seg id="26">The reinforcement of the legislation for 2002 made that the controls are systematic on the stoppings illness of more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, on 1,5 million controls, the CNAM has noticed that 13% of the 285 000 ones realized for stoppings of short duration were "unjustified or too long", or 37 050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of the stoppings of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, one counted 11% of "unsuitable or unjustified" cases on 1,2 million, or 132 000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Altogether, therefore 169 000 "unjustified" cases, on several million wage earners having had an illness stopping.</seg>
<seg id="30">A number that represents face, for example, well little at that of the moonlighting.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the deputy UMP Dominique Tian, author of a relation on the question in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billions euros of lack to win fiscal per annum, or more that the total cost of the daily compensations, and therefore infinitely more that defrauds it to the latter.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">As regards palliative care, the publicity committee that the governments, the institutions of care of health, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian society lives in the denial of the death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of the Canadians accept indeed to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take arrangements for that purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It is one of the conclusions of an imposing relation of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts connected to diverse domains have participated, of which the ethics, the right and the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">This committee commends itself to the government of modifying the criminal Code in order to allow the attended suicide and performs euthanasia it, while this choice dominates, next to a patient considered competent to make such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Of entry of game, the experts quote a recent inquiry of l'Economist Intelligence Unites, who has compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Canada has ranked 10th, the bill study that "the medicalization of the death in Canada has generated a culture in which the people are afraid of approaching the subject of the death".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medicalization or not, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, bring back us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And in spite of the wish that most of the Canadians of dying at home have, 68,6% of them end up dying at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the Whole, from the country, it is in Quebec that this rate is the most raised, with 86% of the dead appearing at the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the delicate question of the euthanasia and of the attended suicide, the authors of the relation arrive to conclusions that go contrary to the position of the federal government, which already has said not to want to change anything to the criminal Code regarding the euthanasia and the attended suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yet, according to the experts, who have also passed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized in review, there is not any proof that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, in other words the practice of the euthanasia or of the suicide attended on people not competent or not willing.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, asserted yesterday in conference call Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the relation, one would find more numerous case of these overflowings precisely in the countries where the euthanasia and the attended suicide are not legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The euthanasia is practised in the Canada, where it is clearly illegal".</seg>
<seg id="17">"The attended suicide is practised in the Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Canadians favorable to the euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Remind that 85% of the Canadians have already pronounced themselves in favour of the euthanasia because they believe that it would allow the people in end of life to reduce their sufferings, according to a survey Angus Reid carried out in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing the euthanasia will not have less value as effect of sending the message that the life of the aged people or handicapped persons has.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for the people having practised the attended suicide, the probed ones value at 41% that they should not be pursued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">As regards maintenance or of suspension of the care next to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the relation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the criminal Code that the withdrawal of the care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The committee of experts also asks that the professionals of the health are formed to the duty of respecting a refusal of the care in end of life, without fearing criminal pursuits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As regards palliative care, the publicity committee that the governments, the institutions of care of health, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, as regards palliative or terminal sedation, already largely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the committee asks that it is considered, while it is not used to reduce the physical pain, as of the euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Reserves of other experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the domain of the right of the health have already expressed reserves regarding the conclusions of the relation of the experts of the royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Me Pierre Deschamps, specialist in right of the health, has described as "extreme" the position of the signatory experts of the relation, among other things because it does not limit practises it of the euthanasia to the patients in terminal stage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"That opens the door to a situation where everyman who would be tired of the life and who would have more than 18 years could ask to what one helps him to commit suicide", calls Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the relation yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="31">Me Deschamps underlines also that the authors of the relation seem to put the autonomy of the person above all the other values that participate in the fabric of society of the society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Yet, "in society, it says, there are beacons and pressures".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The specialist in the right of the health Margaret Somerville also has expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the relation, that it has described as "manifesto pro-euthanasia".</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, which is itself member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests in particular the data of the relation as for the absence of abuse in some countries where performs euthanasia it and the attended suicide are legalized, or to the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Twitter modifies his platform and looks more like Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The site of micro blogging Twitter has introduced Monday of the changes in the presentation of his platform, to allow notably his users to observe the activity of those that they follow, what makes to look his service a bit more to that of Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">A new tag "activity" and another "name" allow following more readably, en direct the activity of the other "Twittos", the Internet users whose messages ("tweets") one follows and those that follow you.</seg>
<seg id="4">That allows knowing if they make messages follow, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This new formula of Twitter has been tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the unity of the network Monday, has indicated the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner, to the AFP.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Twitter, who was known for his little instinctive working, with terms about little esoteric (RT to repeat a message of somebody else, #followfriday to recommend of following another user) making the happiness of the initiates, opens thus to a wider public with a more comparable handling to that of the networks general public Facebook and Google+.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">On the network, the users discussed by dint of "tweets" settled on the interest of this innovation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is useless, intrusive, and that looks too much like Facebook", written @jemb123.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The government of great coalition social democrat/démocrate-chrétien to the power in Austria has decided Tuesday of noting down in the constitution a "budget "golden rule" in order to reduce the public deficits and thus to avoid a possible degradation by the agencies of notation of the sovereign bill of the Austria (triple A).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It is the social democrat chancellor Werner Faymann that has shone even announced this decision at the end of a council of ministers, even though the Austrian public debt is of 74,6%, largely above the criterion of maximum 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly in-underwear of the debts of country as Italy, Greece or the Spain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"If the solvency of Austria was lowered only only of one notch, of AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interests besides every year, has argued the vice-chancellor and démocrate-chrétien minister of the foreign Businesses, Michael Spindelegger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Austria falls thus with reference to a request for the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro zone of last October 26th: the leaders of State and of government then had asked for the registration of here end 2012 of the reduction of the public deficits and of a return to the balance of the public accounts in the constitution or in a law of same value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The mechanism adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Of here 2017, the structural public deficit will have to reduce every year of 0,75% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, as from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State will not have to overtake every year 0,35% of the GDP, while the regional States as the towns will have to present budgets to the balance.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen had to continue go up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"We will intervene as us have made it the last time if we notice an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, has explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Tuesday, the yen went back not to the historical levels that have driven the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">That day, Tokyo has sold massively yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor for 1945 opposite the green back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But the yen regularly has gone back for, doped by purchases of investors who consider it as a "safe investment" in these times uncertain about economic world slowing down and about crisis of indebtedness in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The dollar has ironed Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has brought down under the bar symbolicalness of the 105 yen, close to the levels having started the last intervention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar quoted around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">This outburst of the Japanese currency night to the exportations of the archipelago because it increases the price of the cost of the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the incomes gotten out of the foreign country by the Japanese firms, while they convert them into domestic currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Japan fights to reconstruct itself" from the earthquake and the tsunami of March 11th that have devastated the region of the Tohoku (north-east), has underlined Mr. Noda who fears that this rise of the yen kills the fragile resumption in the egg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The third economic world power has renewed with the growth at the third term -1,5% in relation to the previous term- for the first time in a year, thanks to a bounce of the exportations and of the consumption of the households weighted by the disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">But the Prime Minister has judged that the dearness of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamental ones of Japan".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, has as his part called the Bank of the Japan (BoJ), which has opened Tuesday a meeting of two days of his advice of monetary policy, to take all the possible measures to weaken the yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But the assistant governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, has warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriated measures", letting understand that no additional monetary softening was Wednesday to be waited for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">During his last end meeting October, the institute of emission has increased in 5.000 billion yen (47 billion euros) his purchases of good of the Treasure, making to go by at 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts that it devotes diverse financiers to the purchases of titles to flood the market of liquidities.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">If it is a subject that one can not treat short term from considerations or under the blow of l"émotion, it is well the energetic policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and the cost of l"électricité influence directly on the purchasing power and on the competitiveness of the firms.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is healthy that an electoral appointment is the occasion of thinking at such stakes and instead that the nuclear one keeps there.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the unity of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French must base their opinion on objective facts, of the rational data.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">Even though we are 7 billion human d"êtres on the planet, demographic l"évolution will take a doubling of the request d"électricité of here to 2050 unless one deprives an enormous part of the world population of a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the same time, the rarefaction of the fossil resources will have to be compensated to continue produce of l"électricité permanently, without forgetting the imperious necessity of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas to fight against the climatic disturbance, a subject disappeared of the ecological debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is why Germany is isolated in his decision of renouncing to the nuclear one.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not the case neither of the Belgium, which subjects hers to the necessity of being able to find a source of substitution capable of substituting oneself, nor of Switzerland, who intends not just to build last generation more than the central ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Conversely, the Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for not to quote only them, pursue their projects with determination.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States, them, have decided after Fukushima to add a unity to their park recovering the building of a central interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, based on the renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality annoys the speech.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin is going to be translated by the rise of the price of l"électricité, an energetic dependence aggravated by the increased resort to the imported gas, in particular of Russia, a leap of the emissions of CO2 taken by the building of central to the gas and to the coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In some months, the unity of these regrettable effects are made itself already to feel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark is to be meditated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Champion of Europe of l"éolien, of which it gets out 30% of his electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and of gas because of the irregularity of the wind; in accordance with which, his emissions of CO2 and the price of his electricity are respectively 65% and 50% more raised than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conversely, thanks to the constancy of our energetic policy, our neighbors settle a superior bill d"électricité of 40% at that of the French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though in a globalized economics the cost of l"énergie appoints manufacturer a key factor of competitiveness and a security of the maintenance of the tool on the national territory, the French firms benefit from less expensive l"électricité of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">De ce fait, every significant reduction on behalf of the nuclear one would generate a strong rise of the price of l"électricité, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of the purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">One prices that a broad majority of French refuse to pay the surveys, especially as they do not show opposition of principle to this energy, show it.</seg>

<seg id="29">The development by Areva of little emitting solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, reveals the complementarity of the sources d"énergie.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the nuclear one, to maintain the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.</seg>

<seg id="32">Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are lived of the same obsession of safety.</seg>
<seg id="33">In a demi-siècle, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one, Three Mile Island, is intervened in conditions of normal exploitation; it has remained without human nor environmental consequence.</seg>
<seg id="35">At Tchernobyl, the conception of the reactor and unforgivable human mistakes have caused the drama.</seg>

<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will get out the educations of this accident, as it had made it for the two precedents.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">Fruit of this move and of a cooperation between the authorities of safety, the farmers and the French and German builders, the EPR presents a conception making it capable of resisting such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even though it is considered by all the electricians anxious to build a central one, the stopping of his building at Flamanville would be a magnificent present offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF leaving them the free way to seize the supremacy in the inescapable development of the nuclear one.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Is the immigration a load or a luck for the economics?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The policy as regards immigration taken under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized under diverse corners -obstruction of the police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the policy of the number, compatibility of this policy with the statute proclaimed of "country of the human rights" of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More lately, it is the administrative harassment that are the subject to the foreign students that has been the topicality, the minister of the Inside (to read Release of May 23rd) proclaiming at the same time that France "does not need foreign talents, bricklayers and waiters of restaurant".</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is seldom only analyzed under the economic corner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is that there is on this subject a broad enough consensus between left and right.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the right, the your has been given by Jacques Chirac that declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed persons should not be a problem in a country understanding close to 2 million immigrated workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can" not "receive all the misery of the world" in 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as on the right.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the two edges, the immigrants are perceived as a load for the economics and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference stems from the degree of generosity which one will deign to grant in relation to the immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In his program, François Hollande confines itself to banalities, indicating that the codevelopment will allow solving our "migratory problem".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of the immigration as a load, a problem, is maybe paying électoralement; but it is economically very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As remind it the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthetizing the most recent knowledge on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact in the migratory floods on the economic growth, the salaries and the job in the countries that receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Restricting the anaemia immigration the growth and harms the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears in relation to the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these risk to substitute themselves for the national workers, very particularly the little qualified, exerting a pressure to the fall on their salaries.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the experience shows the national wage earners, exercising professions for the main part in sectors in shortage of job, that, in reality, the immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The little qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract the national wage earners, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training does not follow the offer of jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on the salaries</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the same way that a surgeon will have harm to work in a country that knows a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between national and migrant makes as the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and the job of the national ones.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri thus has calculated that a rise of 1% of the migratory floods leads to an increase included between 0.6 and 0.9 % of the real salaries in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">And it without setting counts the fact that the diversity brought by the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economic growth (strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among the prices Nobel American; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants are as contributeurs net of the social systems, on average to height of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The world Organization of the esteem work for example that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving to the age of 30 years will bring a net contribution (receipts less spend) of 150000 euros to the public budgets on average on the unity of his life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wished, at the beginning of mandate, to go to look for the points of growth missing "with the teeth".</seg>
<seg id="25">The teeth in question, being used to dissuade the immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="2">The democracy is a pretty precious one; it is also a pretty fragile one.</seg>

<seg id="4">Some have been able to believe that it would suffice, so that the democracy triumphed definitively over his enemies, to exercise the vote, and of training it in the way the most direct that is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One knows, for Napoléon "the Small one", that it was there a matter of an easiness of thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of the democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even make "instrument of oppression" to itself as called in the past the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.</seg>
<seg id="7">Not, the democracy requires more well: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, of the Lights, of the economic and social solidarity, a justice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The crisis of the Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is both first a crisis of the political one and democracy very as much.</seg>
<seg id="9">The palinode of the true-fake Greek referendum will have had value of revealing copy to this consideration: that of the necessity of a powerful return of the political one, but also that of the disturbing feeling of his impossibility, of his incongruity.</seg>
<seg id="10">This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="11">The truth is that the lines head-on of the democratic fighting today have moved itself, and that, for many of them, the republican soldiers do not get out more to the good direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We do not have anything to improve at requiring a succession of national referendums, organized to the liking of the necessities and in unsystematic order.</seg>
<seg id="13">A signature to a blank document to the European absolute monarch or a jump at feet joined in the space of the nationalist fold: what a choice for the citizen!</seg>
<seg id="14">Not, we do not want cleavers but an exercise, common, of full right, serene and continuous, of the choice and of the democracy, this time at the European level.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are not crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in the Portugal - moreover one would not know where to stop l"énumération anymore - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the very whole Europe that submits to the diktats of the markets and of the agencies of notation, which suffers from his impotence and from his defect of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is the very whole Europe that is humiliated on the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="18">One worries about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the very whole Europe that loses his sovereignty sweetly, and with it each of his nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The urgency, it is to return the piloting of the European project to the popular sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="20">Because it is a unity, that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, they free themselves markets and they prepare the future investing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exit of crisis will require decisions at the European level that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic legitimity, except of course to drive us to the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">After having long fought this suggestion of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everybody asks today for the European economic government.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is.</seg>
<seg id="24">But to think it without a political and democratic integration stronger, and lived as such a by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new deadlock.</seg>

<seg id="1">From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist forehead spreads</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Paris worries about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Suspected of long date, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sunday, the Algerian vice-ministre of the foreign Businesses, Abdelkader Messahel, has even maintained that Algiers has henceforth "acquired the certainty".</seg>
<seg id="5">"The way whose two organizations occur and whose cooperation the relations of the services of information show there is well", has explained without more precision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris seems to make an analysis similar.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inquiry on the abduction of two French in Niger in last January would have put bridges at the day.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by close relations of Aqmi, Antoine of Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed the day after in same time that several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special strengths.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the rubbles of the intervention, the French and Nigerien investigators had to find several telephonic fleas belonging to the terrorists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Terrorist axis</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The analysis of the past calls directs to several interlocutors based to Mali, to Niger and to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to France Radio International (RFI), two numbers interest particularly the investigators: one leads to a Nigerien who has stayed in a long way to Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other one to a man that tells to itself near of Aqmi and of the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is an overhang but it is needed to wait no doubt for more formal proofs before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".</seg>
<seg id="14">"But it is possible".</seg>
<seg id="15">"One knows for years that the sect benefits from exterior financial and intellectual supports and that it appears more and more active", tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These last months these "supports" had been more and more evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his operating fashions, that imply henceforth the resort to kamikazes or to more and more complex explosive devices and similarly invoice that those used by Aqmi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, to begin through Washington, has made pressure on Abuja ever since so that it takes into account the problems put by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities long have considered indeed the group as a community of illuminated little worthy of interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A fast success</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 at Maiduguri around a mosque, of a school and of the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - who means "the western education" in Hausa "is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this poor region, the association knows a fast success.</seg>
<seg id="22">She politicizes and requires a strict respect of the sharia while his militants engage the fight against the impious central government.</seg>
<seg id="23">The latter aim first at the churches, the bars, the administrations.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram appear particularly active, multiplying the attacks on the police stations.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reaction of Abuja is, as to his habit, without shades.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead men.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, alive order, is killed in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ever since the sect is going to radicalize itself and leave his fiefs of the north.</seg>
<seg id="29">At last Noël, it claims an attack that makes 80 dead men to Jos, then another in Abuja.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram blames the reassured QG of the police during a suicide attack, her first.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local seat of the United Nations will be his first international target.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail of the Mauritania in Somalia going by by Nigeria worries henceforth all the specialists in the safety.</seg>
<seg id="33">Then that Aqmi has surrounded Mali and the Niger, which the Somalis of al-Chebab operate on in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, during a maintenance in Nigeria with the president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and has told loan to itself to share all the information.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, indeed simplistic ideas?</seg>
<seg id="4">To listen to the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.</seg>
<seg id="5">From some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others multiply the thundering declarations and the short cuts as regards foreign policy, traditionally a republican strong point.</seg>
<seg id="6">On China, on Iran, on the help in Israel, the slogans - often not supported - ring out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, the one better put in the race to the nomination of the "Great Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese owing OMC and to question them "for handling of their currency", a carrying theme in an America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of his industry to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">So much worse if that must imply the release of a commercial war, it has said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, ex-ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign policy, has nearly strangled himself in view of an attitude that "flatters" the emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has called muscular but constructive to a dialog with Beijing (the present position of Obama).</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="19">The texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants touches against Iran, is called ready, as for it, to encourage the American army Mexico against the cartels of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="20">The resort to the torture against the presumed terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>

<seg id="22">The adversaries of the present president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that it has won the cold war.</seg>
<seg id="23">They remind that Obama itself was an amateur and that he has had to put water in his wine as regards antiterrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">They stress with reason the failure of his naïve dialog with Iran, on the too fast departure of the "boys" of Iraq, about his equivocations in Libya, giving him thus a label of weak.</seg>

<seg id="1">The North Stream, portal news of ntrée of the Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The gas pipeline Nord Stream, connecting directly the Western Europe to Russia passing at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has gone in operation.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must supply gas for the equivalent with 30 million homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with splinter.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests of which four heads of state and of government have participated, last Tuesday, on the edges of Baltic, between orchestra and thin sideboard, to the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly Russia to Germany, under the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte have turned unity stealing it of the valve ordering the entry of the Russian gas in the west network-European.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new gas pipeline, 27,5 billion additional cubes meters of Russian gas are going to happen every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km connecting the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklembourg-Poméranie.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube must be finished thin 2012, allowing issuing altogether 55 billion cubes meters of gas, or the equivalent of all the French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one evokes already the possibility of building one third on the same route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the completion in time and in hour of this enormous building site has airs of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project had strongly been contested by Poland and the Balt countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">The North Stream is indeed going to allow delivering gas directly in Germany, avoiding every land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to weigh on Russia threatening to close it the access to the markets west-European.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream with a "new germano-soviétique pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Staline to occupy Poland, in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">Saying if the subject is politically sensitive is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, bringing his support to this Russian project, has improved it a greater safety of his supplyings.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is at the price of a weakening of the Europe of the energy, since the project has created a breach among Europeans of the East and of the West.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has known, in five years hardly, to make to triumph his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, strongly consumers of gas, and whose deposits are in decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us in an organic way", has confirmed François Fillon inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating to what point the great gas contracts are as political as economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All that explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, presents in number at Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The building of this gas pipeline is also a technical exploit.</seg>
<seg id="22">The underwater tube is in steel sheathed from concrete in order to protect it from the anchors of the ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, dating minefields of the Second World War have had to be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="25">"A hundred has had to be taken or be destroyed, by precaution", indicates Jens Müller, spokesperson of the society Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It has been needed to multiply also the measures to protect the faun and the flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 turns Eiffel, which nothing interrupts on all his length: neither valve, nor station of maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">A platform of control was predicted off Sweden, but the persons in charge of the project have renounced it even though the Swedish were little anxious to see a society of Russian State set up permanent employee in way off their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the event of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than one minute ", clarifies Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the event of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes therefore to the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is considered little probable by the builders who have foreseen the welds to know an escape every 100 000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The surveillance of the state of the gas pipeline is assured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for the exterior observation, as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">Of the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, width of a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">À L'arrivée, after three complete days of journey to the speed of 3 measure second, it delivers precise information on the possible distortions of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The gas pipeline has been conceived to work fifty years without having to suffer the lesser repairing.</seg>
<seg id="36">The circulation of the gas is simply insured by the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is of 200 bars to the departure, and of 100 to the arrival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five societies have united their strengths to realize this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the parts.</seg>
<seg id="40">Have joined with it the German ones E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Sweat (9% each).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five societies have created a common firm, appointed Nord Stream, responsible to build and to make the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is based at Zoug, in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom has rented afterwards to this society, for twenty renewable years, the whole of the capacities of transport of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever is the quantity of gas really transported", clarifies Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the building of the gas pipeline has been assured to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total cost of the works should reach the 7,4 billion euros for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Sweat, for example, the investment has amounted to 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are sure about fitting in their expenses, since only Gazprom accepts the risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast hammered with pines.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of the valves, high of 4.5 meters, form the exit of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure the pressure, the temperature and the specificity of the gas that happens, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubes meters of Russian gas at every hour that goes by.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, they will be 3 million by hour and in 2012, 6 million.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Created it is a fortnight of years by an Italian firm, the Moleskine wants to return the taste of the writing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It has a perfume of adventures, of hours spent to write in the light of a candle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with his black rectangular blanket, his elastic, his leaves of a white color broken, as aged by the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, the Moleskine notebook such than one knows it today is born... in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Italian firm Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at that time to throw a notebook of bills design but distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">Married Sebregondi, then consultant for the firm, takes care of the launching of the new product.</seg>
<seg id="8">The notebook an old technique of production inspires, the mole skin (skin of mole) who refers to a varnish cotton used to cover banquettes for example.</seg>
<seg id="9">This type of notebook was very taken of the writers and of the travellers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Moleskine has replaced up-to-date an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-gardistes artists, up to the XX e century", tells Maria Sebregondi, become from the person in charge of the brand by Modo Modo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The success is there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010, the sales have increased in 26% to settle at 12,7 million past parts.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is far from the confidential production first years, that only 3 000 notebooks were conceived.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">Difficult of establishing a portrait-robot of the purchaser, because the notebook of bills seduces the businessman as well as the student and the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the image of Moleskine, his consumers are cosmopolitan, open of mind and cultured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The small Italian firm, which counted 12 employees at his beginnings, counts nearly 100 today and has two offices for 2008; the one in Milan and the other one in New York.</seg>
<seg id="18">She distributes his notebooks in the bookshops, of the Fnac to the small stores of downtown and has known to impose his identity.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We have followed the air of the time and this new need of writing, in spite of the flight of the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.</seg>
<seg id="20">This cultural signature accompanies the development with Moleskine: lately, the brand has launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists display their own notebook.</seg>
<seg id="21">In August, it has also launched a blanket in leopard, on the occasion of the Festival of the film of Locarno.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Taking advantage of his success and of this cultural aura, Moleskine has known to diversify his products: bags, agenda, pens, covers of computer... The brand is declined on a whole scale of supports.</seg>
<seg id="23">A success that has made envious ones: at the autumn 2006, Modo Modo has been purchased by the Major fund of investment SG Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Does the unemployment rate of the handicapped workers remain why so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 19% of the handicapped people are in search of a work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 15th week for the job of the handicapped persons opens today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In spite of a voluntarist public policy arrangement in 2005, the unemployment rate of the handicapped people is still two times more high that obtains it: 19%, against 9% for the unity of the population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Discouraging?</seg>
<seg id="6">"Not, underlines Éric Blanchet, chief executive officer of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the job of the handicapped persons. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"The progress fulfilled for fifteen years is sizeable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"At That Time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times more high. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nevertheless it remains still enormously to make. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said that for the handicapped unemployed persons, the obstacles are numerous before reaching the job.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are rather aged: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a little high level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and on the 2,3 million students of the superior education, 10 000 only are handicapped persons.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the unemployment of long duration is very widespread: 53% for the handicapped persons, against 38% on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, as many criteria that complicate the return to the job singularly, and that "constitute the knot of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, chief executive officer of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help the firms to recruit handicapped workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">This is for the objective brakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rest the one non-says, the mentalities that evolve, indeed, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study realized in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the City indicated that the questioned managers have "a level of weak knowledge of the handicap", with one" overrepresentation of the people in rolling chair, of the psychological deficient ones or intellectuals".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Result, the firms deprived of more than 20 wage earners are still far from reaching the objective of job of 6% of handicapped workers, set in a law of... 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last well known numbers, which date back to 2008, state a ratio of 2,6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We are now around 3%", indicates White Stone, chief executive officer of the Agefiph, the organism loaded with collecting the contributions of the firms that do not respect this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof: the number of establishments "taxed", all as the versed amounts, have reduced between 2007 and 2011, passer-by 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and of 606 at 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has created a strong pressure on the firms, explains White Stone. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement translated also a true awareness, in particular in the great groups. "</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the ministry of the job, only 59% of the establishments of 20 to 49 wage earners use workers handicapped, against salaried 82% of the firms of 100 to 199.</seg>
