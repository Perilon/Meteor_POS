<p>
<seg id="2">The Ukrainian Parliament refused, within the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the project of cancellation of the paragraph relating to the inculpation of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The deputies refused in second reading the draft amendment aiming at the reduction of the sorrows for economic frauds, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently imprisoned ex-First Minister.</seg>

<seg id="4">Tymosenko was condemned in October to 7 years of prison to have concluded an agreement a priori detrimental with Russia for the purchase from natural gas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Libyan Victoire</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The release or Libyan rebellion has already its defeated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is finished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It remains to determine the winners.</seg>
<seg id="5">As it is of habit in the area, the winners with the elections are the islamist ones, but acts it of moderate or the radicals.</seg>
<seg id="6">The provisional National council issued the usual right of Charia and we know already what it acts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight one cuts the hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">The women can forget the emancipation, nonthe respectful possible ones of the faith are liable to the capital punishment…</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In fact the Koran will link instead of the personality of the dictator the company made up of opposite tribes.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot represent it to us and as we would surely not like.</seg>
<seg id="11">But our way of living is not single, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for the Libyans.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is particularly astonishing that the islamist warriors accepted the assistance with recognition of the unfaithful dogs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only excuse it is that it is not a general américian who directed strikings of NATO but rather Allah of which they celebrated the size with each attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">When it is thus a question of seeking the winners in Libya, the occident is not part of it</seg>
<seg id="15">We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our poilitiques was diverted of the dictator as a political ally without that not bringing any profit.</seg>
<seg id="16">After recent the bad experiments of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">It there thus not of problem for the buildings to get rid of the “crusaders”.</seg>
<seg id="18">Will the oil companies without occupation of the ground, have access to oil libyien easily.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps not as much and the occident will be able to be finally praised of a protection not involved in the human rights.</seg>
<seg id="20">For little that we prevent these followers of the charia of them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Food of an obese child: does not have a breakfast not and takes pork-butchery for the dinner</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">More than one third of the children from 9 to 13 years has problems of overweight, 9% of the écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese.</seg>
<seg id="3">As shows it current research the obese children come families which have an unhealthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">That shows again at which point the medium is important in which evolves the human being and the models which surround it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the tables of the obese children one finds for example pork-butchery 50% more often than in the families of children to the standard weight.</seg>
<seg id="6">19% of obese had chips with the dinner according to the investigation conducted with a publicity campaign “Obesity is not a chance”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In the families of small large the sport is also not a practice, which is now the case of the majority of the schoolboys of today - only 15% answered that at least once per week the parents found time for active movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Inquire carried out into 900 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The investigation proceeded during the last school year and took part 900 pupils of the elementary schools of Tchéquie.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was the second edition of “Obesity is not a chance”, action supported by the general Insurance of health and the Unilever company.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Since the beginning it is more than 12000 first form pupils to the third who were registered with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">One of the determining factors which cause a dramatic increase amongst children in overweight, even obese, is the absence, of a correct food and not enough physical exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">“Only half of the questioned children indicates for example to eat 5 times per breakfast day case - to lunch - to taste to dine, which is one basic principles of a good food”, one of the results of the investigation indicates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Without breakfast and pork-butchery with the dinner</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development one needs some basic details such as a breakfast in family per same hour.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Tchéquie, only 23% of the families of the pupils eat per my same hour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In the major part of the families each one has her breakfast alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the worst which was raised is than a tenth of the population does not have a breakfast at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">The breakfast is however the base of a good daily food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The questionnaire showed that in the families of the obese children one more often consumes of unhealthy chips.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost each pupil - without speaking of weight - drinks each day of sweetened drinks (70%).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">More than 40% of the questioned children does sports regularly but for the parents it is half, only 15%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Prepare your food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another part of the investigation made it possible to selected children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare his own food starting from possibilities suggested according to their own taste and their personal opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">“The preferences of the Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far, with the plan of a healthy food, ideal”.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among their preferred dishes there are many cakes, the meats and the sugar refineries.</seg>
<seg id="27">“More alarming is in particular a great preference for the sweetened lemonades”, is indicated in the results of the investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the lunch in fact the pastes took the first place right in front of the white meat.</seg>
<seg id="29">The children did not want starchy foods at all and the preference for fish and the meals of vegetables was very weak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Cape on health</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The investigation also showed that the children are ready to change their practices as from the moment when they receive the ad hoc information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">“During a control of a group of participants in the investigation who had filled the questionnaire after the meeting with sensitizing “Obesity is not a chance”, one has assity with a well defined will to move towards a healthy food”, the results of the investigation indicate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Most outstanding was for example concerning the sweetened lemonades because the children started to give the preference to the water of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="34">The children notched generally on the questionnaire the white meat and fish like main course and would reduce the sweetened dishes and the “knedliky” (spécialté Czech of pellets of potato or bread flour).</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The designer must be also a good psychologist, say the professionals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In a relative presentation article like learning for the designers, I put myself a little bit in anger owing to the fact that there was much as of the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="3">I did not think of what was going to arrive thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Talks of three professionals of the speciality, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what occurs on the spot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more we approach the final examinations and the more practical exercises and information expect us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And even when there are courses the samedis and dimanches it “is truly stuffed”.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we have with the Alenka director (with the course there is no boy) treaty in the way of equipping the woman who does not have measurements standards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And of the women of this type it is the majority.</seg>
<seg id="10">One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without particular curve, another of the overweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">The designer must know how optically to reduce broad arms, to prolong a neck or to add curves necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We were thus able to underline the character nicely and also not to equip in a too medium way of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and marked hips and a small size.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If there is for example a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or the pants do not pass at all, that is worth the blow to be made it make custom-tailored.</seg>
<seg id="14">And you will not regret it because the clothing which tomb impeccably is priceless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In a custom-tailored skirt you will feel much better than in that which slips permanently, is rolled up and does not hold with the belt and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For those which have a male appearance have can allow a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of bent fabrics, or even of the embroideries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am content that I have all the week to sort all the received information.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I am also afraid that in view of what I must do at the house there too much is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each trainee accepted a celebrity to be equipped for the day and the evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">We must take into account current appearance, the type of mode of the personality like its appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I will have “to equip " Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know campaign the Secrecy of Victoria.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At the bottom of me, that pleases me, because it is better than to equip Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost hundred kilos lately (do not take my declaration, please, completely with serious) or the young person Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">We must cut and sew starting from the magazines or seek on Internet, print and work graphics.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moodboard, like one says for the final result, expresses our personal style like our relationship to the graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">To also reflect on the graphic part of the styling is also important.</seg>
<seg id="26">The designer does not equip thus only the physique but creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on products given tendencies for the handbags, the coats, etc…).</seg>
<seg id="27">Mario Kamenik, designer and graphic designer, maintained us all that.</seg>
<seg id="28">But that,… until Sunday</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The designer must have a general vision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Three guests of the speciality gave an aspect diversified to the meeting of Saturday filled of information on the various types of characters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of mode and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded to us that the fashion is an illusion and the designer should know to use it.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a designer of talent can work with only one clothing in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="34">Variability is for this paramount example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As for example this trench coat which must be carried in a traditional way with a Jean and a tee-shirt as a light coat but also it can also equip the naked body, with court shoes and take it in photograph like a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or it is enough to go up the handles or the collar and to have immediately a new look.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Play with that " it underlined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But I particularly appreciated the following council: “For work you need to know the rules perfectly”.</seg>
<seg id="39">“You can then start to contravene it”, Jakub said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally I understand why one endeavours to learn these rules, what to make with, towards what, why, whereas in the magazines of mode one sees sometimes something of other.</seg>
<seg id="41">No declaration on the fashion shows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben whom the designer must have much more alternatives of clothing than those which are photographed.</seg>
<seg id="43">I.e. that for fashion story which will have about ten pages (thus about ten models) I must be ready of “to recut " at least about fifteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And as, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently as actually.</seg>
<seg id="45">We must take into account that during a creation of a model.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The fact that the image and the style make sometimes half of success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is enough to look at Madonna who is not a super singer but its image and marketing made a star of it world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In Tchéquie, the approach towards the use of the services of the designers remains still frileuse.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the known faces consider them sometimes as useless (it is enough that I know something but what I appear master key with the second rank).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if somebody is made make a styling of our share, we must then count on the fact that it dictates to us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than that which it actually has.</seg>
<seg id="51">It remains us then that to surf on google and to ensure themselves if information of boulevard mentions celebrity in question, if she lost weight or enlarged etc…</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Honza and Mario posed to us Sunday on the heart which it is not enough for the designer to be directed in the fashion and to know to assemble models.</seg>
<seg id="53">It must communicate with the people whom it equips and it is thus important to be a good psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">To know to guess people, not to flatter, preserve its opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">“When a manager asks you of him to sort his cupboard and to fill it of new elements you cannot all throw and tell him, My God which horror.”</seg>
<seg id="56">“You will find some business which you will find pretty and him that you will advise with what to carry them”, known as Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">This one concretely showed us what must all contain what one calls the “placovka " or bag of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is that which you hang around the size and which you have on oneself for all which you need.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In addition to the clearly definite things like the scissors, the rollers for depilation or even the pins with nurse, one finds there also wire of nylon (that the designer uses to photograph products like bags, or many hats), of the special clips with which one closes a clothing in the back, if it is too large (the pin or another type of staple is not utlisables because they could damage clothing) or a kit of seam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">So that we did not soyions only people who listen but which tested something in way practices they taught us how to sole shoes correctly.</seg>
<seg id="61">And during the photo meeting in the workshop where surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, a fortiori with lexterior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">And thus we stuck and stuck.</seg>
<seg id="63">We did not have the right to touch the scissors not to be wounded by inadvertency.</seg>
<seg id="64">Truly competences are thus needed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario pleased me when he congratulated me for my creation.</seg>
<seg id="66">The comptence of which I mention is not for my girlfriend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">This is only one small summary of what we learned during the second weekend from course</seg>
<seg id="68">I start more and more to understand that to make styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of pinks, that each one says of them what he wants.</seg>

<seg id="2">Revision</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the beginning a race without problem changes because of a whole of stupid errors people who do not have anything of it to make in a morning displacement creature of habit with work.</seg>
<seg id="4">That fills until a certain measurement the ambition of each one but that is not used for nothing if nobody wants to do something moreover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The new subtitled part The Run produced great waitings before its exit.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised to take a new direction with the series of already old race Need for Speed and to leave a kind of play starting from the playable parts which would not be taken into account only points.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were thus curious how will be the passages added during which the principal hero leaves his car and fact what it has desire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Like that is already made in the series NFS, the result is completely other than what one atttendait.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are potentially plays of race of arcades but the unit draws downwards because of some useless faults which already have existed for several years.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are not really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on behalf of the developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure starts very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">You are taken in the adventure whose hero principal Jack has characterial problems and to regulate them starts to take part in illegal races through America.</seg>
<seg id="13">You sit down behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first at New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The idea has interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The route is divided into ten stages and then besides 50 races.</seg>
<seg id="16">What results from it that each race is done on another route and the stages envisaged in different environments which are distinguished from/to each other rather well and are interesting.</seg>
<seg id="17">The player does not have the urgent only one feeling that the play proposes something of identical to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Certain environments are in addition rather pretty even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the preceding series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Finally it is not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="20">But control through the desert, in landscapes of autumn or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant visually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The tests besides time in time are decorated of an atypical element.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example in the desert you find yourselves in a sandstorm which decreases you in a significant way the visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then in the mountains you must pay attention so that an avalanche does not fall you above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Concurrently to that the various races are well arranged the ones behind the others.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is only one small number of it but that is enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">It of the moments you endeavours there to exceed the number requested of adversaries (as in a traditional race) then you will run against the watch (duel traditional with the stop watch) and then still another duel with an adversary expects you.</seg>
<seg id="27">From time to time you have also the police which enters the play and which tries to return the difficult situation to you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The innovation are the passages except vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is rather about una interactive animation when most of the time Jack flees in front of somebody and you must help it while typing on the good button at the good moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">What is surprising it is that there is less of moments of this type than than you wait (to be concrete there are only three of them).</seg>
<seg id="32">With the result it is well like that because this element is not likely to obstruct and is placed, in the context described above, the elements which decorate the play.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The model of control is in the tradition of the preceding plays.</seg>
<seg id="34">What means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but one cannot say that it is negative.</seg>
<seg id="35">Concerning realistic simulation you will have to go to see elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But although one can better find in the conccurrence the model of control goes very well with the type of design of the races.</seg>
<seg id="37">Thus all is ok.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The problems start to appear after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the model of control, that of the collisions is not yet at the point.</seg>
<seg id="40">We do not expect EC play a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, at the time of a collision with any object, the least idea in the way in which your car behaves, it is thus not completely good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">During tight goings beyond you touch yourselves sometimes mutually slightly but otherwise your car leaves in insane stunt-flyings.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or finds itself in crumbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the system of restarting that is not really a problem but that really aggravates you.</seg>
<seg id="44">The restarting is made so that when you broke the figure or you left in the decoration the play brings back for you at the time of the last point on the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">But you have only 5 restartings.</seg>
<seg id="46">When you used the 5 restartings you must start again the play since the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is thus more one tool, for the case where something does not occur as it is necessary, than something on which you can truly count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes the restartings do not help and it is necessary to find the solution by remémorrant of memory the piece of route in question.</seg>
<seg id="49">The great difficulty of this play it is that the same actions are found in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">For example there are certain turns which it is necessary to pass in a certain way if not that does not pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Otherwise you always meet on a given place of the “civil " vehicles in the same configuration that you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a late minute.</seg>
<seg id="52">What puts in anger they are the situations when you see easily passing the adversary between two cars coming in opposite direction and when you arrive, you, you need is to put themselves on side and the conturner or to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is equal if you go ahead of him because it “is calculated " in such way that for the situation given it arrives always very close to your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The adversaries still have other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="55">During all the time of the play, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same adversary which precedes you at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="56">That irritates more at the end of the play when you roll on a long bridge in opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The adversary must pass at all costs in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="58">When it passes in front of you it hiding place you the sight of the other vehicles in opposite direction and you enter in collision a good amount of times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">One can understand that the goal of this play is to do something of captivating and full with adrédaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is damage because through a simple model of control the play is interesting and the places with so much of action than you do not have time to follow all that occurs.</seg>
<seg id="61">And it is equal if it is because of concept of 50 single routes, that the order of the races is such as it does not have no chance there to be bored or something of other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The original idea is the change of car during races.</seg>
<seg id="63">You must pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change there car however most of the time that which you have is enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sport scars are ideal for the cities, the American big-engined cars for the right highways and the super sport scars with the exotic attire on the very technical conduits for example on the roads in lace in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of the adventure, goes very well with the principal mode of the history.</seg>
<seg id="67">You receive not only medals but also points of experiment which are added to your profile which is common to the challenges and the adventure.</seg>
<seg id="68">When you reached more the high level of driver, various objects start to be unbolted:</seg>
<seg id="69">This one is connected on-line with the Autolog function which inter alia compares your results got with those of other players and other functions in the community get to you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the blows most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.</seg>
<seg id="71">You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the subway (that resembles) where you roll in the darkness on the ways (that resembles).</seg>
<seg id="72">Your speedometer shows to you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you arrive a subway train which sends the car to you directly with scrap.</seg>
<seg id="73">With the drafting we had a discussion during a few days with knowing if somebody really reflected during the creation of this play or if the authors really take to us for imbeciles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical part of the play is not extra, but the visual part is in general pleasant and in certain really super cases.</seg>
<seg id="75">What obstructs it is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in certain cases in a tragic way.</seg>
<seg id="76">That relates to especially the accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is not useful to you any more with nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The sound part is good and the track is with the choice.</seg>
<seg id="78">With an aim of liking greatest number and particularly more the young public a new sound track was created in the style “I mix all”, but one can expect that nobody will buy the play for the music.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">General impression of Need for Speed: Run is thus really confused.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the play did not have these stupid errors we could say without fear which it is the best production of NFS these last years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But this play gives the impression not to be finished.</seg>
<seg id="82">The recreation is really well but prepare so that the faults type you in the eyes with the force of reflectors of aerodrome.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vicenova, Ambassadress close the Union européeenne:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">“The treaty of Lisbon radically removed balance between the institutions”</seg>
<seg id="4">“I did not expect such a hard war”.</seg>
<seg id="5">“That will last 5.6 years before the situation is calmed and that all the players are accustomed to their new role”, thus Miléna Vicenova began its talk with the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassadress close the European Union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When it succeeded in describing the various bodies of the EU and their relations in a so comprehensible and visible way, so much so that a large number of lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the University Charles could envy it, it showed at which point it takes her motto “comprehensible and openly in connection with Europe " very with the serious one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mrs Vicenova paid homage to the work of Hermann Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“As of the beginning criticisms resounded which it is insipid, that it is a pen-pusher, that it cannot fill no mission and I must say that it cut the breath to everyone because it holds his role to perfection”.</seg>
<seg id="9">“It is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, to communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take Europe”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">She explained the new post office of High representing for the foreign affairs and the defense policy within the framework of an answer to the question: “Which is which with the European Union?” “With which phone number do I have to call? ”, therefore like an important step towards the unicity and a greater legibility of the policy of the Union vis-a-vis the states, as is China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky to us (cooked cheese which feels very extremely)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mrs Vicenova mentioned also diary that lived, saw and will live in a short while the European Council.</seg>
<seg id="13">It qualified the Czech presidency of two years ago of success.</seg>
<seg id="14">Czech solved the rising financial crisis, the crisis of gas or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">It qualified the fall of gourvernement of very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation at the EU is in this moment very occupied.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the words of Madam the Ambassadress, “the activity beat full sound " not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which continues to be solved still now.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is moreover necessary to approve the new budget septimal Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As it would seem that the budget will be mean and for economies, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped more, less, all is to be solved within the framework as of future negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Madam the Ambassadress pointed out her slogans with which it arrived at Brussels “For comprehensible Europe”.</seg>
<seg id="21">“I really do not like the abbreviations, the foreign words, the jargons that nobody understands.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the citizen who must understand it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or twisted gherkins, differently large bananas or although nobody prohibited to us to make syrecky”.</seg>
<seg id="23">She wants to better use the environment of the EU and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Europe at several speeds expects us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the Ambassadress the Czechs have the reputation to be Eurosceptics and people who see the things only in their negative aspect more than positively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover it is sorry to see a so small Czech representation in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fault results, according to it, several factors, such as for example the timidity of our candidates, their incapacity to write a covering letter and a weak support of the Czech part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to a Czech presidency with success it then underlined the force and the co-operation of the Visegrad countries.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Believe me, when towards me the Pole comes, the Magyar, the Slovak one, this French tells me: 'Hé, that estce that you do make over there, which still these Visegrad countries make? “and it is not at all content”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">According to Mrs Vicenova, in a near future in fact hard new rules as regards budget policy expect the member countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is the concept of two-speed Europe, if it is not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a “new European Federation”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">“We have countries in the euro zone and others out of the zone.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“We have space Schengen, we also have the institute of closer cooperation”.</seg>
<seg id="34">Initially it was known as that between them the countries cooperate which want it and those which do not wish it remain in their corner.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“There will be many institutes of this type and there will be really two-speed Europe”, expects Mrs Vicenova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">From this point of view she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Hermann Van Rompuye to determine the bases according to which all the topics having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not only the memebres of the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1">History of a mark:</seg>
<seg id="2">The IBM innovator begins the second century of his existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If somebody were to seek the term which expresses with more close the IBM strategy, nearest would be “the long run”.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt like very current and however since its creation it ran out hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The base of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first chief of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.</seg>
<seg id="6">It left this slogan which a large number of world problems can be regulated for little that people are eager to reflect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Its slogan “PENSE'! “became the print around which will develop the life of a future giant (and as the title of the internal magazine as IBM started to publish in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">It was the base of the culture of the company soignement worked out by Watson.</seg>
<seg id="9">For us IBM means long-term thought of continuous motions directed towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived hundred years thanks to the fact that it remained always faithful to its basic values and however was not afraid to change all the others around it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That enabled us during our first century to transform technology, the business and the company.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the second century we will reach even more " délaré for the birthday the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A well prepared system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson, in the Thirties, put himself to deal with his employees as Bata as a Czech Republic - people of IBM were among the first American employees to only have the paid vacancies, an insurance paid by the employer plus a uniform of elegant employee and a quite elaborate system of rewards for the inventors and the commercial ones.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the same way IBM has a sytème of relations with the quite elaborate customer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talents like one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.</seg>
<seg id="17">The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory strategy since it will be a woman Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano in charge of IBM.</seg>
<seg id="18">This one has worked at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the post of head as the Sales, Marketing and of the Strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM during last years does what one calls of the jamy, of the brain- storming on line from what are resulting much from future strategies and the innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is not astonishing that it has many ideas - in the firm there is nearly 500000 people who work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good name</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is the internal and external image company which ensure to him a sure position in the fields of the business.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather of institution that of a technological firm”, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of economy at the School of saving in Harvard and author of the book on IBM.</seg>
<seg id="24">“IBM is not a technlogic firm but a firm which helps to solve problems of the world of the business by using its technology”, added Geogre Colony of the firm of Consulting Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As known as the firm itself there is a difference between entering on the market and creating this market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - or the “Sea”, as it is called familiarly in the United States in view of its slogan in hundred years it grew until becoming one of largest world firms the.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is obviously the technological firm most general-purpose - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, lodging, consulting services on the level of the products of the waiter until the nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">It has many patents of all the American technological firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among its discoveries lines up for example the automatic teller machine, the purchasing card, the financial swap, the code bar or the diskette.</seg>
<seg id="30">IBM found this year with 220 billion dollars the second larger firm technological according to the capitalization of the market (first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Seen in advance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">They are not all the innovations and manufacturing which had the preference of the customer and the time - IBM for example did not make a success of the bet on an operational system proper OS/2, Prodige service in line or of the computer IBM PCjr:</seg>
<seg id="33">“From the moment when your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot emotionally remain hung on the past, “points out Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">For that IBM does not have a problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not function it goes from there.</seg>
<seg id="35">With the difference for example of Microsoft conccurent which at the base are held and remained under the operational system Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">A perspective technology</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the incomes IBM, the services, which are formed for a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a dominating place.</seg>
<seg id="38">However still in 1990 it with was more motié of participation the strongest representative of hardware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">From the year 2000 IBM sold credits with poor yield for 15 billion dollars, during cettre period it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of perspective technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">It continues in investments and even starting from 2008, when for the first time it exceeded the new financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased his volume of investments.</seg>
<seg id="42">Does it appear from now on that IBM passes the current crisis without being worried?</seg>
<seg id="43">The price of the IBM action progessé starting from 2008 in the rocket of 120 pourcent, the net earning of the firm continues to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The logo of the IBM firm is to change all but not its values.</seg>
<seg id="45">One can expect for that this flexible giant controls other crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">History of IBM: From the cheese slices until the flights in cosmos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York hundred years ago\; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was about a mark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and in South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The base of future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history is related to the Eighty of the ten ninth century.</seg>
<seg id="50">They had technologies such as for example old the “pointer ones”, the pendulums which recorded the arrival and the departure of the employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory board of the company.</seg>
<seg id="52">Flint engaged the chief of a concurrent firm Thomas J. Watson to help it to direct the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">The leader overshadowed then the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that rest until now the identity and the culture of the company.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson directed the firm kusqu' in 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, like says it its name, started with the production of all the possible machines for the business and the trade - meat and cheese slicers to the cash registers.</seg>
<seg id="56">During the first four years during which Watson directed, the turnover multiplied until reaching 9 million dollars and began the expansion of the firm in all the parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of direction it is his/her son who occupied the armchair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under its direction IBM began the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the Sixties people and the computers of IBM helped NASA has to guide the flights in cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM System/360.</seg>
<seg id="61">The traditional PC which determined the standard of computer of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later IBM sells its factory of computers at the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and started to deal with council and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy which succeeds at IBM these three last years - is the concept Smarter Planet “a more intelligent planet”.</seg>
<seg id="64">Its objective is the intelligent uilisation of technology in fields not yet exploited such as for example the transport and the management of the cities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">As regards the field the IBM commercial developed little time ago a platform “Smarter Commerce " which helps the commercial ones to manage all the commercial cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM also has a strong history on our territory.</seg>
<seg id="67">It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first Central European country and Eastern.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic center of outsourcing of Brno.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Power station for the Central and Eastern Europe sits at Prague and there are also the research team and development of the world level which deals with the voice recognition.</seg>

<seg id="2">If you ask the men to determine typical defects of the women, all, the ones like the others, are able to leave them “their handle”.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female defects which manage to pump the blood of the veins of the men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Purchases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Does your half pass remarks to you that you are dependant on the purchases?</seg>
<seg id="6">Have to buy at least a clothing per week to you?</seg>
<seg id="7">Are you glad to buy and per packages at the time as of balances?</seg>
<seg id="8">In your case one can speak about the purchases like a defect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Certain women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases.</seg>
<seg id="10">But will you say, which would resist the window shopping clothes shops, to seek for oneself of pretty clothing and then to test them all in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">And although for most women buying is a hobby, that can become for the man a true hell.</seg>
<seg id="12">Recall only how much time have thinks to your spouse that it waits at the entry…</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Constant dissatisfaction</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“Amn't I too large”?</seg>
<seg id="15">“I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilos - I should start to do sports?”</seg>
<seg id="16">“You like Me?”</seg>
<seg id="17">Don't these sentences point out something to you?</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes?</seg>
<seg id="19">You thus belong to these women who are obsessed by their appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is not the question which should cease to you occupying you of yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.</seg>
<seg id="21">The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more the women become poisoning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The odre and cleanliness in the first place</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It is like an infinite horse-gear.</seg>
<seg id="24">To wash the windows, to pass the vacuum cleaner, to clean the grounds, to make dust, to pickle the bathroom - and that twice per week.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do you pass remarks with your partner whom it goes with dirty feet on the clean ground, with the children that they dirtied the wash-hand basin, clogged the pane of the living room, and that gives you much work?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">If you precisely suffer from this obsession, try to have with the spirit which should not anything be exaggerated and which the order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.</seg>
<seg id="27">This inoffensive desire of cleanliness can however waste your relations and even family peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Sabotage</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">“Met this track suit used with the dustbin”.</seg>
<seg id="30">“You intend to put these old socks still tomorrow?”</seg>
<seg id="31">“A wet towel does not have anything to make by ground”.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you make on your partner this sabotage in this way several times per day, you really will break up it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It is obvious that you do not think of evil you want that all is impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps that if the men knew it, the women would not have to do such an amount of sabotage…</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Defamation, mockery</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Defamation, the mockery but also the insults against somebody is also clean certain women.</seg>
<seg id="37">The women are carried particularly to the relations and thus are glad to cover issues like which, where, with which, how and why.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Perhaps that each one of us lets escape a small inoffensive mockery here and there.</seg>
<seg id="39">The hand on the heart it is however a characteristic of the women.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the worst is those which advise, deride, even scorns the others and is for their entourage - particularly with work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">How the prices of the voyages evolved since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The travel agencies at that time especially proposed voyages in the countries of the socialist block, because the voyages to the west were very limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Czech tourists travelled for the vacancies to East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, the Crimea and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both at sea Noire) and in Hungary (Balaton).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A great exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was authorized to travel to Yugoslavia then the mode started to have an inclination for the west and the voyages towards Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The great paradox of the socialist time was that it nétait not authorized for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechoslovakian ones) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the Tchécoslovaque citizen wanted to travel individually for example to Poland or Soviet Union it needed an invitation letter if not the individual voyage was not authorized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The travel agencies at that time however offered also voyages to the West it was necessary to make the tail all the night with a bag of bed or to have a “good knowledge " within the travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">And even after that it was not gained yet.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agreement for the currencies which was the condition to travel to the west was refused with “politically incorrect " people who could not travel at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovakian currency was not however exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Czechs generally spent their vacancies in the country where there were consequently many country cottage and country houses which the Czechs bought and this practice lasts until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The voyages of the Czechs since knew since 1989 a great revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Although until 1989 the vacancies in East Germany and Bulgaria were to the maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days of vacancies in the countries of the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The great paradox of which we are not aware today it is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go because left Yugoslavia of the time freely until 1989.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The removal of the visas in the Nineties of last century in the adjoining countries of the west caused an enormous wave of visits of short time especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czechoslovakian ones could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that each one wanted to see at least a moment.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example in Paris the organizations of voyages made sleep the Czechs in tents in the parks because our incomes did not enable us to pay the hotel or a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The typical feature of a Czech voyage was at that time to carry with oneself its own food preserves, sausage, etc… to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after tens of years of freely being able to buy Western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living as well as the average wages increased what caused around the year 1997 another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to an increasing demand for the voyages the travel agencies started to since 1997 prepare turns with connections by air charters which thanks to contracts formidably reduced the costs compared to what there was front.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the Nineties of last century the Czechs had connections without visas with practically most developed countries of the whole world except for HAVE which later facilitated our voyages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-revolution, when the first air charter towards an exotic country was prepared, Thailand, starting from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="25">For this year as each year of the direct air charters have taken along Czech tourists in the remote hot countries\; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations starting from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries each year!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Still an interesting moment during this time which symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">on November 17th, 2008 HAVE the visas for the Czech tourists removed and made it possible our country to completely line up in the group of the developed countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in the history passed more half of their vacancies abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time still in the history spent more than 15,000 crowns per anybody for vacancies abroad including the additional loads. Crowns by anybody.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The general meeting must find her President but that is likely to end in a situation unresolved “a stalemate”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Close to 5mois already Czech football is without President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek in charge of the Association of the Football of the Czech Republic is not yet known after still a General Assembly which must be held Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">However there still does not exist agreement according to which regulation of vote it is necessary to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without this agreement it is not possible to start to vote for one of the three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested by the direction of Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hasek gave its resignation in June and during its departure called his/her colleagues has to link and find a strong personality which will direct football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only during the era after Hasek football retrogressed worms of the divergences between the rooms of Association which cannot agree on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">That completely showed on September 16th when a new president had to be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was even no question of treating way of electing.</seg>
<seg id="10">There no was agreement on the fact of knowing which has the right to vote with the General Assembly - only, seems it, statutory representatives or also invested civils servant of absolute powers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point there has been an agreement partial for this moment with the assistance also of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the absolute power is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="12">The divergences always continue concerning the regulation for the election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its negotiation planned or extraordinary, did not bring anything either to the situation</seg>
<seg id="14">The opinions on the possibilitě of vote changed several times but the sensitive spots remain always the same one.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how to proceed for the third turn not to fall into the stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“The bone of contention resides in the following fact: that is to say to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model”, one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda noted who represents professional football within association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the rules of the model envisaged gains with the third turn that of the candidates which will have received the most voice expressed as a percentage within the room for which he is candidate.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravie is ready according to what one says to withdraw so that the candidate gains who will have received the greatest percentage of voice of the two rooms.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Czech part studies the condition which the winner should have two thirds at least percentages of voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">“Only that would make then lose the idea of two preceding turns and that would make completely refuse the bicameral concept”, Svoboda admits which understands the objections of the Moravian part and according to which best would be not to change the regulation and to vote according to the statutes in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is surprising which Tomas Paclik is also agreement even if it estimates that the regulation of the elections established according to the statutes favours more Pelta among all the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">“I wish that one vote to the maximum according to the statutes of association”.</seg>
<seg id="23">“So that there are no yet absurd ideas imagined by a representative as during General meetings passed”, the owner of Victoria Plzen declared who is candidate for the first time and which in its talks was defined especially against Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him in Nymburk it there will have a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future unit and in a constructive way.</seg>
<seg id="26">“The possible qualification today in Championship of Europe should calm everyone”.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Football will be again on a wave of happiness and it aure more spirit for a co-operation " adds there the officer of Jablonec which among the three has greatest experience as regards direction of football as well professional as at the regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="29">“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tended”.</seg>
<seg id="30">“It is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravian ones, but there are tendencies to want to change the regulations with drawing”.</seg>
<seg id="31">“That can cause a blocking in Assemblé again general”.</seg>
<seg id="32">“I hope all the same that the healthy reason will gain " said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It does not remain much of time for an agreement common to all the parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say if all the direction of football will be complete for the match.</seg>
<seg id="35">The especially chartered flight in which were to travel until Podgorice inter alia the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and one sought an alternative to take along part of the executive committee on the ground of the reprisals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be determining.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Minister for the education of youth and the sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parts torn within the strongest sports club of the country and to bring them to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the play there is much: an official equipment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of the Sports which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclik from goes away to the combat for the position of president because he does not see any correct candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If the chief of the footballers of Plzen Divided into volumes Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered all that he asks for a new President of the Association of the football of Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put in shift for this high position.</seg>
<seg id="41">“If such a candidate I exist support it, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election.”</seg>
<seg id="42">“But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate”, Paclik at the Czech Press agency declared (CTK).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The motivation of Paclik is to enter competing with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl for precisely trying to prevent Pelta from reaching in charge of the AFRT which a priori would be given favorite for this election.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclik also underlines that if it would gain the elections it would hold this position of president only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He would see well in the function an experienced and high level manager but who is not dependant with the world of football.</seg>
<seg id="46">“I discussed with people who would have the profile”, he says.</seg>
<seg id="47">“For me that was terrible when certain told me that they did not want to be identified with Czech football in this moment.”</seg>
<seg id="48">“I would like to make change this image”, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What, one says, obstructs especially Paclik, it is the relation between Pelta and the President of the Regional union of the football of Plzen Roman Berbr, man with the contreversée fame which is known in the slides as lobbyist able to influence the Assembled vote of the delegates 'general one.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position of President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">“If it gained, the actual position would remain and there would be nothing again in football.”</seg>
<seg id="52">“And with the support of Berbr, which is commercial of high flight, that would be even less favorable to football”, Paclik proclaimed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What still shocks it is the fact that the name of Pelta was marked it there a few years during listenings within the framework of an investigation on a corruption affair, for which Pelta was left there without any sorrow.</seg>
<seg id="54">“I do not know which Pelta prestige would bring to football.”</seg>
<seg id="55">“And how would be us considered with the eyes of the UEFA and of the FIFA " Paclik says, which declared some time ago “if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">If Paclik would triumph with the vote over Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September which had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">“It (Pelta) would be the first with which I would go”.</seg>
<seg id="59">“He has great ability”</seg>
<seg id="60">“It would be able to be presented for example in the form of a chief of the representation”.</seg>
<seg id="61">“But as to manage Association it would not be able.”</seg>
<seg id="62">“I do not put the nose in what I do not know”, Paclik indicates which in September drew a great attention when he decided for the cancellation of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela which Dagmar Damkova replaced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclik affirms that it would be on the level to direct Association.</seg>
<seg id="64">It takes as example its capacities to direct private firms and which it also directs since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with its support last May its triumph in the first division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">“I have the force to make change something in the world of the sport and to bring a certain culture there”.</seg>
<seg id="66">“I would slow down the influence of certain interested groups which tend for example to influence the disciplinary Commission and of call, which brings to situations of bad taste”, Paclik added which chache not its antipathy for the chief of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">It would also consider a harmonization of the relations with the Czech Olympic committee whose power of lobby near the high level policies would make it possible to obtain for the sport more money of the tax on the plays.</seg>
<seg id="68">“It is one of the key points whose new President should occupy himself”.</seg>
<seg id="69">“If it is the tax on the games of chance as the political parties declare it, I understand their argumentations but they should also say where the money goes”, he declared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paclik does not take its current connection with the club of Plzen as something of negative even if itself affirms that the President of the AFRT should be “above parties”.</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta is again dependant with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">“It is not the ideal”.</seg>
<seg id="73">I do not see reason to transmit my actions of the club of Plzen to somebody if I must return one year and half after”, Paclik declared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to the situations of stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidate to the presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes which should put an end in the future with the quarrels concerning the regulation for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="76">The civil servant of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday in very optimistic Nymburk and thinks that the success today of the representation of football should calm this war before the vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta before the election of September which was not carried out precisely promised to be devoted to the national representation and obtaining financial means if he is elected.</seg>
<seg id="78">It decided to be candidate at the last time right before the last General Assembly and this delay of two months could enable him well to defend its vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broad context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">“People on all the levels make football for a long time and wait until Thursday there is a President”.</seg>
<seg id="80">“They feel that it is the best moment so that somebody takes over the leadership of Association”, he adds, but he is above all dependant with the club of Jablonec, worked a large number of years in Sparta and the Executive committee of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="81">it is also for that it has enough experiments to direct Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election an euphoria is which reigned with lépoque of Ivan Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="83">“Unfortunately with L " Assembled general of June of the statutes were approved which were not perfect as all are seen by it”.</seg>
<seg id="84">“If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already had a President since September”, Pelta underlines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association which took all the attention of the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">“If I become President, I take it as personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities for them if that does not go”.</seg>
<seg id="87">“It is a principle without which we cannot exist”, Pelta added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Then he makes an effort, one says, not to confront itself with his adversaries.</seg>
<seg id="89">He declared before that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl which he recognizes in view of his training in right and which he knows pertinently that its adversary-candidate would be its first Vice-president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">It either for a long time did not attack Tonas Paclik which on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">“It has evolved in football for one year and already had some successes.”</seg>
<seg id="92">“Its attacks were however not more honourable and has surprised many people during the countryside.”</seg>
<seg id="93">“It is also for that some now have doubts about its character”, Pelta intended for its adversary declared but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations that it made in September.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">“If Jindrich Rajchl are elected new President of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic with L " General Assembly of Thursday that would not like the current Vice-president a large number of people, it appears.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises however that if he would be elected one starts to work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants changes systemic and to return the members of the Executive committee are responsible for the various fields of football.</seg>
<seg id="107">He also promised to regulate the Bohémians business, to improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, to bring to football more money and to continue the work started with the predecessor Ivan Hasek.</seg>

</p>

<seg id="111">“I am a player of team and want to distribute competences within the Executive committee so that each member deals with given field.”</seg>
<seg id="112">“And I will distribute difficult missions so that football face a great step ahead”.</seg>
<seg id="113">“Much of people will not be content because it will be a question of starting to work hard rather than to criticize the others " he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">It mentioned, it is said, that it would not be represented like candidate because of a critical atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="115">“In connection with me, one knows that I work 20 hours per day.”</seg>
<seg id="116">“but I need to know if that is worth the blow and if I have people behind me who will unceasingly put sticks in the wheels to me and will express doubts on each one as of the my actions”, explaining why he hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">“Much of people said me all the same that I should not give up because they would also give up”.</seg>
<seg id="118">“It is a confidence which I cannot betray”, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">What justifies it, one says, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="120">“For these two last years there has been a great work in fact and I do not want to drop it”.</seg>
<seg id="121">“There are processes which were launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like that somebody stops them. ', he declared with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">“I believe in a systematic work and it is a thing which Mirek Pelta cannot make”.</seg>
<seg id="123">“Behind him people are who fairaient football in such a way that it would be only for those which were selected”.</seg>
<seg id="124">“One can reproach me a certain number of things but not to surely support quelq' one”.</seg>
<seg id="125">“I endeavour to be objective”.</seg>
<seg id="126">“I want to make football for all because everyone will be content step only those which were selected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">And it confirms again that he would be only one President for Tchéquie.</seg>
<seg id="128">“And if there are some who say the opposite, I am ready to do the utmost for Moravie”.</seg>
<seg id="129">“For example, it is the time to consider which the second division is divided into two parts one Czech and the other Moravian one of which the winners would find themselves in the first division.”</seg>
<seg id="130">“There would be no situation as currently with only three team Moravian in division because the problem is currently to find young players.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">As Divided into volumes Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of president, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances to gain.</seg>
<seg id="132">“I permanently feel a support of the Czech Room which elected me its Vice-president and knows that with me there will be successes”, Rajchl declared which plans among its future successes to save tens of million crowns on detrimental contracts, negotiations of contracts with televisions and on the law on the plays.</seg>
<seg id="133">He says on the contrary which the fact that Association is not plain is a fault common to all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">Whereas he says in connection with Pelta “that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose its credibility”, he thinks that the second Paclik adversary is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.</seg>
<seg id="135">“Nobody can question at Plzen which it made this year a superb work”.</seg>
<seg id="136">“If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started with Hasek and would not make notable change among the people in the Commissions.”</seg>
<seg id="137">“He would not like to waste his successes " said Rajchl which has evaluated his rivals.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A jump in blue</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">De Julia Stanek</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Paddling pools in optics of UFO, splendid swimming pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having turned the city or goes for a long walk can let put back his legs tired in aerated water baths.</seg>
<seg id="5">A book shows in which basin of swimming one can experiment the most wellbeing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder went on a journey of research during the last 18 months, there is an object which should not miss in its luggage: its bathing suit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Extended on its back in water, it observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and swam against the Putten marbles which expected it on the other side of the swimming pool and did not fail to admire the Art nouveau meticulously restored these converted swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="8">If a covered swimming pool pleased him, it noted in its notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 swimming pools were probed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and it presented them in its book already published: “Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath”. Municipal covered swimming pools of Munich, historical palates of bath in the black forest, “concrete Hardware buildings - core” in Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It led its “voyages to the most exceptional baths of the Central Europe” in 13 country. Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she respectively visited places in Italy, France, Tchéquie, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The 46 years German is true enthusiastic of the culture of the bath.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meder, explains why it does not have much interest for the sport but ell feels attracted with the water in a completely different way.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is irritating which the supporteurs of swimming must be satisfied to contemplate blue squares and to put up themselves with the stink of bleach while the jogging shoes breathe of the perfume bewitching of the forests of spruce or can listen to chirp of merry birds of the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“I wondered one day why the swimming pools must in fact being always so ugly” said the Viennese.</seg>
<seg id="15">“I thus began a collection of beautiful baths.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Water surface reinforces architecture doubly</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">A diving in a swimming pool and volatile oils of sauna - factor of wellbeing in the rooms of swimming are enormous because all the directions are waked up, according to Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builders would have tried hard a little more, the rooms to swim could be a sheer delight for the eyes: “Instead of a floor there is a water surface in the rooms of swimming.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“It is on a side transparent, but however reflects on another side the beauty of the entire building.”</seg>
<seg id="20">All surfaces arise double way optically: high vaults, multicoloured squares, springboards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The volume of image of small size “Badefreuden” submits a report worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of the historical wellbeing - it gives certainly desire for making a jump in blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The Meder collector discovered remarkable specimens during its research in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beside the splendid baths of wellbeing like the Széchenyi bath 100 years old in Budapest, it found water containing of nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (bath of cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths of which the basins are filled with water containing of alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and being in a building in the shape of bottle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the other hand, the swimming pools heated in the open air of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular sights. While of a roof of the bath of Zurich there is all the city in his eyes, one can admire Arlberg covered with snow starting from a swimming pool external of St Anton: The Turkish bath is provided with a window from which one can observe animation on the ski slope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most extraordinary design of the swimming pool expects the swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an UFO which has just landed on the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">In winter, vapor rises of the three opened plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise towards the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the black forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">the odor of bleach does not emanate from all the swimming pools of the Meder collection.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur odor, from Árpád-spa in Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong oil odor, which it is difficult to believe, to be in a spa health.</seg>
<seg id="30">The odor comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to you with the skin as soon as you let yourselves slip into the swimming pool - a special experiment of spa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">During its search of beautiful the swimming pools, Iris Meder also underwent disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free swimming pool external and in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bath conceived by architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed meanwhile.</seg>
<seg id="33">By throwing a glance by the window of New building-Art in red-white-yellow, it observed the blooming of weeds between the squares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palate of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad.</seg>
<seg id="35">This building already survived three phases\; one can discover not only elements néo-Romans which leave since its design in 1844 but still a room Moor in Alhambra style which was added to him in 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since its careful modernization of 1995, the thermal palate remains the favorite bath of expert in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it is originating in Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="37">“It is already a beautiful output which to melt so different styles of construction in a so formidable unit”, known as Meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">With such a palate, the diving in the thermal swimming pool is apparently only one minor question.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The German bank examines in details the speculation on the raw material</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Of Christian Teevs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">German gives up does its bank it speculation on the raw materials?</seg>
<seg id="5">According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann charged a working group with seeking the consequences of the speculation for the poor of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the chief of the group wants to then draw some from the consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg -</seg>
<seg id="8">For the citizens of the Federal republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of the Germans find unacceptable that the banks speculate in the raw materials like corn and wheat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of the questioned people even require that the German bank and other institutes of credit stop this avenue of business because it increases the problems of poorest world.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the result of a Forsa investigation on the order of the organization of the Foodwatch consumers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author Harald Schumann underlines in this article that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on the total raw materials, pushes the prices to the top and that the banks share a complicity with the world famine.</seg>
<seg id="13">The protection campaign of consumers is aligned concretely against the chief of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The speculation on the raw materials was initially introduced to protect the merchants against the price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the majority of the experts share the opinion meanwhile that the punters were detached from supply and demand - and benefit the expenses from very poor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently of the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and known as, “no business is worth the sorrow to bring into play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information of SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group currently examines the charges of Foodwatch-Carryforward.</seg>
<seg id="18">The examination must be finished from here the end of the year, then the conclusions reached by the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the chief of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="20">It could result a reduction from it from the market of the raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann builds his Image</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode greeted the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms towards the financial sector: “The speculation on the rise in prices of the foodstuffs shows in a particularly Draconian way, which point the banks of today harm the general interest.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann is the first banking lobby with being today particularly under obligation.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Deutsche Bank must remove all the placements of its wallet, for which money was invested on the food speculations” declared Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">“That imports little, for Mr Ackermann, if it is question of famished people or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is concerned.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The awakening of Ackermann can appear at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the chairman of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving its functions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Deutsche Bank made announce Monday that the president of the Board of directors will not change anything with what is envisaged within the Board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ll could improve its brand image with an abandonment of the discussed agricultural speculations.</seg>
<seg id="29">And about possible losses, it has to hardly be concerned with it - its successor will be worried some.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">One on two would cancel the placements on the raw materials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch endeavours to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">Until now more than 30,000 Net surfers already took part in the countryside of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bode published the Mardi survey, with which November 7th and 8th the Forsa Institute carried out questionnaires near 1001 people.</seg>
<seg id="34">Just eleven percent found that legitimates that Deutsche Bank proposes placements for which bets on the prices of the food substances are made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many customers of the bank would also draw some from the personal consequences if they learned that their bank takes part in such operations: one on two would cancel, following the survey, all the placements for which money is injected into the speculations on the raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="36">43 percent would disadvise of such a bank to their entourage, 49% answered that they would think of the cancellation of their account to change D” banking institution.</seg>

<seg id="2">The House which moved</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">D' Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and Happy End: the Austrian house for the world exposures of Brussels in 1958 gained prices, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty then fell in ruin.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now it is again opened and holds place of house of exposure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If one is filled with enthusiasm for a modern architecture of post-war period, for his forms clear, his hangars out of glass, his paces sharp and daring and his new building materials which are typical belief towards technical progress, then the house of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the World Fair of Brussels in 1958 in is a good and famous example.</seg>
<seg id="7">The House of Schwanzer formerly accepted the “Grand Prix of Architecture” for its construction steel and glass, light and suspended.</seg>
<seg id="8">Construction is regarded until our days as a big step in the contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">It made the architects so famous, whom it also built the House for the following Austrian World Fair.</seg>
<seg id="10">With its legendary house with four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in the shape of bowl in Munich, it finally became famous with the international level in 1973.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its project of house as a temporary construction had been exposed after the World Fair in the Swiss Garden to the station of the south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -</seg>
<seg id="12">But the building neither nor technically was physically adapted for a museum - not of walls to hang works of art, therefore not a good environment.</seg>
<seg id="13">However it was used also a long time, jusqu " so that the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001 the building was empty and was dilapidated more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the House, he now is called after “House of the 21st century” and will in the future be used like museum for the contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tuesday evening the Belvédère museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exposure - a stroke of luck to any point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The new departure was concluded by Agnès Husslein-Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, promoted a historian of art to a considerable career amongst other things in its youth of artistic skater, thereafter at Sotheby' S, with the museum Guggenheim and as a direct founder of the museum of the modern art of Salzburg, she undertook particularly to good the alterations near the politicians and from the protection of the monuments, she obtained public funds and of sponsoring private and the exploitation established some.</seg>
<seg id="19">Except the contemporary art, works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation carries the same name were exposed there, a coffee and a bookstore are there, and an office must be built there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict monitoring, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the realization Krischanitz was thus the ideal interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because it had transformed and widened with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had gained the contest, but because it had studied at the technical University of Vienna and that for him the house was “an extremely important place” place where it had seen “practically each weekend” the exposures.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the project of origin, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following its displacement in Vienna and from its change of use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the time of the current transformations, there were big problems: L " building was “a pit in energy”, known as Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The profiles of windows of the frontages out of glass were changed, of glass insulating reinforced out of glass fibers was posed and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">The beams of the cold bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the coatings filled with asbestos were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two basements made room for the new exploitation, a panel of light filtered between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge led to the entry - it is almost a new construction, but always light Pavillon Schwanzer.</seg>
<seg id="28">The doors external of origins remained, the house is painted in a color rust protection of color red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is even exactly identical so that it was formerly.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all that under narrow monitoring of the competent jurisdictions for the monuments and with a small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Often of the materials which are good and not very expensive were to be found, and which also likes the office of protection monuments”, said Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in basement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite everything the constraints, the problems and the transformations, L " building remained flexible and light.</seg>
<seg id="33">That would have been difficult with the House, “which came from Brussels”, said Krischanitz recently, a typical history of “Drop-in-tea-City”.</seg>
<seg id="34">Such an architecture is “always at the bad place” and wants despite everything “to wake up the clear conscience”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">But in this case the House of the 21st century is not at the bad place, because if it is at a stretch about chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden precisely draws up the “district of the central station” all lately envisaged, with offices and apartments.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another stroke of luck perhaps will occur: the House of the 21st century could profit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the center of Berliner temporary art, and like he says himself, she already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.</seg>

<seg id="4">Up to that point the large US investor Warren Buffett unceasingly explains not to invest in data-processing companies TI, considering L " evolution long-term of the companies let appear only bad forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="5">It however read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investments in this sector.</seg>

<seg id="7">An investment of Warren Buffett is regarded as an attack of knight in the financial world.</seg>
<seg id="8">Consequently the activity TI IBM grants the right to be called now “Mr IBM”.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">Because Buffett revealed today with L " economic emission CNBC, which it bought since March of the IBM actions of a value of 10.7 billion dollars.</seg>

<seg id="12">He congratulated the direction, which even during the economic crisis had ensured of the reasonable benefit.</seg>
<seg id="13">“You made a super job”, Buffett said strategically.</seg>
<seg id="14">IBM for some time put on the lucrative services TI in so much qu” exploitation of the countable centers.</seg>

<seg id="2">After the discovery of the “cell of Zwickauer” the media Turkish doubt the German rule of law.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper speaks even about a “bloody ideology”, which reappears now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The assassinations of eight nationals Turkish and a Greek small company in the years 2000 to 2006 had a context extremist.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following this news, Turkey as well as the germano-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because for much of germano-Turkish the spectrum which one believed for a long time dead remade his appearance: since the attacks flamers of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there more was comparable violence in this context extremist of right-hand side against the Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">That there is in Germany a xenophobia, it was however never question.</seg>
<seg id="8">The network extremist of right-hand side which was detected reveals however proportions whose dimension is far from being foreseeable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">“This Is a return to the bloody ideology”, “Such was the title of the publication on Internet of the Turkish daily newspaper “Haberturk”.</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper “Sabah” underlines on the other hand that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries owing to the fact that the German authorities could be implied in the mud pit of far right.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is in a reasoned way that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend with a quiet commemoration with the racial victims of violence in front of the door of Brandebourg.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are only two weeks before that the Turkish community of Berlin and the German policies and Turkish had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the agreement of recruitment germano-Turkish.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is with merry colors that the cohabitation had been production, symbolizing a history of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The reports of certain media Turkish make the effect of a slap: “the gift of Germany for the fiftieth birthday” such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform “Haber X”, which refers to the context of the murder series.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also the German publication of the “Hürriyet” is not deprived to draw some from the univocal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="16">“that starts to stink”, Such is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">It stresses there that people would have been assassinated, would have paid taxes and would have made by their work an important contribution to the rebuilding of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the forums germano-Turkish and those had discussed success of their research thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Why the weather did not already come much earlier to mind from the German authorities to be research in certain suspect mediums of far right, the authors are astonished.</seg>
<seg id="20">More one is ready at least with average even drastic rhetorics: “If the business continues to be skimped on, it will remain with the migrants anything else only the self-defense and the armament”.</seg>
<seg id="21">“that will be well the best self-defense”.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Interior peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of information and the relevance on the punishment of the whole of the network”, writing “Selen”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What that means if interior peace in Germany east in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the Nineties explained well.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photograph of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event showed the Turks more clearly living here than there is a tangible threat, and with the Germans, to what mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could lead.</seg>
<seg id="26">The attacks however sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.</seg>

<seg id="1">The bank with scandal of Lake Zurich</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">UBS went bankrupt in the financial crisis almost and patinates meanwhile from one crisis to another.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a German who must direct now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is certainly not what Axel Weber S " was imagined.</seg>
<seg id="6">After its spectacular departure of the head of Bundesbank\; one was informed in July, which it would occupy in 2013 station almost such a spectacular: President of the Board of directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber was publicly delighted, greeted\; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its solidity recently obtained and made pass from pleasant observations on the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">“UBS made a success of Turnaround”.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I am delighted by collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">And yet, as of September it was clear that all was going to change.</seg>
<seg id="11">A merchant of titles of UBS to London had diverted all the security systems of the Bank and had flamed approximately 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The chief of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">of the President of the board of directors of UBS is regarded since as suffering - and all require: When Axel Weber does it return finally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">We already learned that Weber can be advised starting from February 2012 bank.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will take again the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, like the bank communicated Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not banking, much more professor D " economy and President of the bank, and it would certainly have needed one period of adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="18">At a stretch he then assumes the responsibility for the strategy for a bank, which has just proven once again moreover than it for a long time deserved the title of “more the large bank with scandal of Europe”.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, UBS is on an enormous side - until recently, it was the largest manager of credits of the world, and other, it patinates since years from one scandal to another.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, saves to it so proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">That started during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the Swiss manager of credits, silencer and solid, but also crafty one, it had combined it with ambitious objectives: she wanted to also become, in the field of the banking investment, very a large bank.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thus UBS managed on a side in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more money coming from easy customers than very other banks in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the more large banks of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">That made impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of bank during long years in Zurich tell: “I always took UBS as model of good bank in front of my students.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“In current optics, one wonders: how I could quite simply have misled me at this point?”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It deeply was mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn out badly to UBS.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year president Peter Wuffli withdrew himself in a surprising way, which was regarded up to that point as a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later one had a presentiment of for which reasons it had left.</seg>
<seg id="33">The division of the bank had flamed with documents sub-bonus and has to make a cross on billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">To shoulder that, UBS announced a capital growth of an amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross above.</seg>
<seg id="35">For that it actually found investors, but who, little front time, would have wrinkled the eyebrows: an Asian government stock not-transparency coming from Singapore and an Arab government stock, which had overlooked, so much so that one even never learned its name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That N " was however that the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008 that was worsened.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank was to announce losses again amounting to billion, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, which was still in 2006 the second board of directors best paid of Switzerland, was withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: UBS was, taking into account its errors of investment, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the State.</seg>
<seg id="40">The national bank repurchased in the UBS of tens of billion titles problematic, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds in actions, for which it could become joint owner of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">All Switzerland was shaken - because it noted at which point that can be dramatic for a small country, to shelter of if large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Lastly, the total of the assessment of UBS 2007 S " raised with more than five times the economic performances of Switzerland (see graphic).</seg>
<seg id="43">“We could not save UBS once again”, said the researcher of banks, Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">After the first catastrophe it was followed from there by the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">Already a few front months, UBS had capitulated because of a tax disagreement with America and was declared ready to publish the data of the easy customers, which had defrauded the tax department perhaps with the assistance of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, it accepted a payment of 780 million dollars - in refunding of unjustified benefit coming from these operations with a raised fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Thus UBS more or less published that it had helped with the tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time it lost something which was always its capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal the Swiss banking secrecy was not the same one any more.</seg>
<seg id="50">It followed from there withdrawal of the chief of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="51">And of the exodus of the money of the customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Thus the bank had lost in a few months its credibility in the two principal sectors of business: the banking investment because of bad speculations and the management of credits because of the assistance with the tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And, as there was somewhat a return to a state of calm, and as it was thought, than UBS would be left there, it followed from there this unhappy history of merchants of title: only one merchant of title flames 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realizes that something did not turn out badly.</seg>
<seg id="54">And one publishes: with the risk management in investment bank that still does not seem to function.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">“With the case Adoboli, one could note that the control of the risks with too little changed”, said Martin Jansen, economist and professor of finances at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also the finance director of a German large bank in is sure: “the problem of UBS is that she does not hold the control of the risks.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">However it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had for a long time taken their function, that to become guard of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but safety for the money - and the world could crumble well beyond the alpine republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of a steadfast reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli is it for a particularly noble chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The power station of UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the stereotyped solid of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.</seg>
<seg id="60">Already the situation is traditional.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its seat at the central station of Zurich, which directly leads central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-covered tops of the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of stores appear among highest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">The jewellers like Tiffany' S, one finds them here between the stores of Swiss traditions just like those of the Sprüngli confectionery.</seg>
<seg id="64">Since centuries of the Swiss bankers resided here: national bank via the palate of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">One arrives in the hall of UBS by a door carries.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of are thick chairs of leather, and beside the logo of the bank, a large label for “safe”.</seg>
<seg id="67">UBS knows what the customer seeks here: safety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other isolated of the market - or betrayed the two Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the chief of a small Swiss private bank finds.</seg>
<seg id="69">He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all the Swiss bankers he also gets bargains with the two large banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">UBS would have become well too large, find-you it - especially in the banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons moreover would have spread themselves.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss ones would have there nothing any more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">“And when well even, they for a long time adapted to manners of the Anglo-Saxons.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">That was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank which changed UBS, it made high benefit and then the rout: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of the sub-bonus like the Swiss large bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The catastrophe became connect on October 15th, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="75">“This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants undertook the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation”, the author Lukas Hässig in his book “the crash landing of UBS writes”.</seg>
<seg id="76">With up to 68 billion francs approximately, that is to say 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save bankruptcy the large bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How that could it arrive?</seg>
<seg id="78">If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they especially see the problem in keeping with UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998 two of the three Swiss large banks concluded an enormous group together.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and recorded an increase unceasingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">What helped, it is that the two prédécesseuses banks different from UBS supplemented: a rich bank, but in lethargy with like strong point the management of credits to poorer Zurich and, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the international investment banks had favorably access to much money, with which they could turn an enormous wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 Chief of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, formerly president of the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="84">“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a team of dream”, said the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">“Wuffli, the large modest intellectual, who gets along there very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one, which cut through a path until the top with the training of the bank.”</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel would have trusted jusqu " at the end with Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And wuffli would have probably made at the end a decisive mistake: “He thought that its models were reality”, known as Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">“It is a tragic fall.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragedy, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">A thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">The staff of UBS remembers clearly the meetings of the leaders during which the chief of the Wuffli group always pronounced the same watchword: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The US bank was the most powerful investment bank of planet.</seg>
<seg id="93">It ordered “League Tables” the classifications, which documented at that time the success of the banks.</seg>
<seg id="94">After all UBS wanted to assemble all in top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Certain stages already succeeded to him.</seg>
<seg id="96">In business of currencies and transactions of securities she played a very important part.</seg>
<seg id="97">The advisers of company, who had the responsibility for it, underlined however a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in the banking jargon “Fixed Income”, there would be an enormous difference compared to the more large banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">UBS would have gaps on the level of the American products of mortgages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To fill this gap, UBS east launched out in an adventure, which almost costed him the life.</seg>
<seg id="100">Made thirsty of growth, it is as well the bank itself as a bottom of management created before it in the American placements sub-bonus which invested.</seg>
<seg id="101">It was transformed into a massive machine which packed and makes pass the documents of value based on the American mortgage financings - but which also preserved risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Even when other banks for a long time sought to go down.</seg>
<seg id="103">“Still in the course of the summer 2007, whereas the market of the American real estate was in flames, UBS bought there”, said Geiger, the banking expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">More the euphoria is large plus the fall is brutal.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after the other had to leave, when to put an end to the attempts proved more difficult than one thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Stations at UBS became ejector and are until now bancaux.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">That which directs the large bank has a task almost impossible.</seg>
<seg id="108">It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models disappeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">The researcher of bank, Geiger has already an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration with the management of goods, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">But the bank does not want (still) to go also far.</seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment bank must atrophy itself vigorously, as much as that is clear jusqu " now.</seg>
<seg id="112">Next Thursday the chief of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">The 51 years old Italo-Switzerland was only supposed to be on a purely transitory basis when the bank separated with surprised from its Grübel predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, it was essential: it must carry out the business of UBS durably, communicated the Bank of Zurich Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to bring back the investment bank to the progress report of the middle of the years 1990.</seg>
<seg id="116">It cancels 3500 employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But that will not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">With what does want she to earn money?</seg>
<seg id="121">They are questions qu” Axel Weber was certainly already posed.</seg>
<seg id="122">He publicly says until now only that he was going to seek with his wife an apartment in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">The next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The intelligent crows are propagated in cities</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In much of places, rooks are regarded as “problem of oiseaux°” But the experts affirm that these very intelligent animals do not let themselves any more drive out cities for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Some like them, some others want to get rid some of as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city since centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents multiply because of the dirtiness and of the noise of the animals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">An antidote against the “°problème of birds” is not yet in sight.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the time of the first ostfriesisch symposium on the crows, the experts said that it is not possible any more to drive out the rooks of the cities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The experts of all Germany deliberated on the possible solutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They seek alternatives in the cities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The guards of nature also based the problems of the cities on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The use of the chemical products in agriculture destroys traditional living spaces more and more.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hunting, the installation and the tree felling typical of incubation made the life difficult to the birds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The crows are under protection of nature.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are large colonies with more than 600 couples of incubation in the westfälischen Soest, in the North-West among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim close to Bremen like in Leer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 2005, a discussed project had gained negative publicities because of massacre of the crows in this area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Criticisms found the capture of the birds in traps and their slaughter with clubs particularly brutal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“Normal expulsion, the ousting, is not used for nothing”, the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer noted, Werner Klöver.</seg>
<seg id="15">The destruction of the nests using water under pressure or to cut down the trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser de Lahr to Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they disperse in other places.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">L " ousting is conceivable only in the exceptional cases as in the hospitals, the old people's homes or the schools.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We are obliged to live with them, we cannot more exterminate them.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The problem is not let solve in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of the animals to a aversif conditioning and accrocheuses offers, in order to allow them to reinstall itself elsewhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Psychologist and ethnologist, ATU Maria Jürgens prospected “panels of information instead of slicers” in order to establish completely different relations with: “We can finally better support a button with the face with an amount of self-confidence.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Jürgens has Co-founded Ascheberger-advance-educational baskets with the Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing on the life of these very intelligent rooks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This project was adopted meanwhile by the tourists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critic with regard to the noise caused by the birds: “Here are a large number of communication, these birds have to say themselves much”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The intelligence and the skill of the animals are legendary: The rooks do not use only instruments of work to arrive at a treat but they manufacture themselves their tools like instruments of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Ethologists of the university of Cambridge tested four rooks recently, at which point the intelligence of the birds arrives.</seg>
<seg id="27">In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they were to make collapse a scaffolding with stones to arrive thus to a larva.</seg>
<seg id="28">Without much of training, they recognized déterminément that a stone was to have certain size and form to make break down the platform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In a second test, the astute crows were to then solve a squater problem.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.</seg>
<seg id="31">The birds could not reach their spoils with their nozzle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">However, the researchers had placed pieces of wire at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="33">All the four animals formed a hook with the assistance of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.</seg>
<seg id="34">Three of the four rooks one succeeds even as of the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1">The personal demolition of mass</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The new book of Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Heading “The Beauty and the Sorrow: Year Intimate History of the First World War” (the beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begin with a long list from characters which tightens you the heart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">A council to start: tear this page carefully and make your mark-page.</seg>
<seg id="4">You will learn how to know these people in detail. In this romantic account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these a few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fogs of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize of literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">He wrote a book out of commun run here that he describes, with exactitude, like “a work of anti-history.”</seg>
<seg id="8">It comprises some known names, of the important treaties or the famous battles\; one finds almost no ambassador nor discussion on the strategies and the material.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not a book so much on what it occurred, he explains, which a “describing book what that could resemble”. One finds there the “feelings, impressions, experiments and moods.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">“The beauty and sorrow” summarize the experiments in time of war of 20 men and more or less ordinary women, on the two sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists with escaladeurs, via doctors, ambulance men and salesmen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some will become of the heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others of the prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become insane or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their lives waver here like the candles of a church: whereas some die out, one relights the new ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The book of Peter Englund deviates from the traditional books of history.</seg>
<seg id="15">It brings a denial to the idea according to which the First World War is summarized only by the terrible war of the trenches on the Western face.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The beauty and sorrow” skilfully describe other theaters of war: the Alps, Balkans, the Eastern face, Mésopotamie and Eastern Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers present in this book are under hives\; one passes Christmas to Egypt under the pyramids\; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This book is moving as of the first page.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war invades the lives of these people a such natural disaster, a such Katrina hurricane which stinks cordite.</seg>
<seg id="20">When blows of gun resound with far, and that you are a mother with the hearth, do you remain or flee you?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who will come in any event?</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost nobody can understand what it occurred, nor even reasons of this war.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts was packed by assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, theories conspirationnists, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">“The beauty and sorrow” follow individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse within the Russian army, like Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the fleet of German open sea.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories are mainly draw from memories, letters and other documents already published.</seg>
<seg id="26">The versions of their lives can be terrifying or enthralling, but are preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.</seg>
<seg id="27">The majority approach the deprivation and the capacity to leave itself there.</seg>
<seg id="28">By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund written: “Substitute, everywhere substitute. ”</seg>
<seg id="29">“Coffee of replacement, false aluminum, imitation of rubber, paper bindings, buttons out of wooden.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It continues on the food of replacement in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">It describes “cooked made rice meat crushed in grease of sheep (and finished with a false wood bone)\; tobacco manufactured with dry roots and dried potato skin\; soles of shoes out of wooden.”</seg>
<seg id="32">He affirms that “837 authorized meats of substitution are recorded in the production of sausages. One also finds 511 coffees of substitution.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Certain stories approach the honor and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognizes his own impulse towards brutality and declares in connection with the war: “You feel that after all, it is it for what the men were intended, rather than to sit down in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whiskey with the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than to claim that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and hobnailed shirt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he high risk to die, and that nobody will notice it or attention will not lend to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">“When one is resigned to sacrifice itself, one hopes to have a public” writes it.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is unfortunately rather comparable with “a condemned man strangled in secrecy”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations relate to the decline of old Europe and new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">“The conflict becomes more and more an economic history of competition” writes Peter Englund, “a war between the factories.”</seg>
<seg id="40">It seizes the arrival of what it calls “a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of mass well articulated and ideologically convinced, in well cut clothing, which carries out its butchery while having sat behind a counter.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People act in an unexpected way\; one finds as many basic behaviors of heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Peter Englund speaks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid the service with the face.</seg>
<seg id="43">“One finds the expression most grotesque in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and S " spread out over the genitals in the hope of finishing at the hospital”, writes it.</seg>
<seg id="44">“Most desperate apply it to the eyes, which results in a blindness with life.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation of Swedish by Serious Peter, the prose of Peter Englund flexible but nonostentatious, is adapted perfectly to its task of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="46">In tens of short scenes, it seizes the way in which the war “started exclusively unverifiable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion for the religion. ”</seg>
<seg id="47">People start to wonder why their leaders make them a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best works treating of the First World War are often indirect, like “Great War and Modern Memory” (the Great War and modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or “In the west nothing again”, of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.</seg>
<seg id="49">The work of Peter Englund is the not very conventional Pantheon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The end of the book is more overpowering that I read in a not-fictional work.</seg>
<seg id="51">I will not reveal it.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as if it had emerged from its book, seized by your hands this page where figure the list of people and burned with a match.</seg>

<seg id="20">Vehicles of the services urgently equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slipway and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, close to the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening.</seg>

<seg id="1">The trade union of the school assistances continues the city for dismissals</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The trade union which represents hundreds of school assistances having lost their employment last month envisages to bring Wednesday a lawsuit at the city for useless and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on the schools accommodating of the underprivileged schoolboys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The continuations are probably the ultimate weapon of the trade union, Conseil of the 37e District, to try to make cancel the dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred soixante-douze school assistances, coordinators of parents and other employees, being part of the least best paid city, lost their employment on October 7th. The trade union leaders compared these dismissals with a political revenge not to have let the city reach a bottom for health care directed by the groups of workers, and who would have allowed to enclose the variation of budget last spring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The municipal authorities denied this charge categorically.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the time of an audience of the Town council last month, the chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott declared that the dismissals constituted part of the budget enclosed in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the Council counteracted, mentioning that the dismissals of school assistances N " were at all specified in the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The officers of the Council of the 37e District declared that they would fill an opinion of claim, informing the department of the education which it would be continued\; a press conference will be organized Wednesday to officially announce the legal proceedings at the Supreme court of State of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Refusals Mr. Walcott and the department of L " education of the city will constitute the part defendant. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight fired workers, very of black color or origin latin americans, as most school assistances which lost their employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the legal department of the city, declared that the municipality has not been able yet to see the reasons of the lawsuit and cannot thus make comments on the allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to an outline of complaints obtained by New York Times, the trade union would bet on the number of dismissals in the schools of the most underprivileged districts of the city to support its complaint against an inequitable treatment, informant whom the poorest schools would lose the most assistances because of a regular under-financing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">While one counts no dismissal on Staten Island, and some hardly in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistances lost their employment in the 23e District of Brownsville, and 46 in 8th and 9th Districts of the southern districts of Bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Noting the loss of five school assistances out of eight employees at public school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of the schoolboys live in poverty, the continuations affirm that “It is not a district of easy parents who can bring funds to fill the budgetary lack.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The budget of L " public school 36 was tiny room of 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional financing for each inscription D " raises underprivileged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The trade union also affirms that the directors of high schools could be induced in error by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memo employed the term “going beyond” to describe the action, even if “going beyond” more generally describes the action to move a teacher of a school towards a group of workers available whose wages are paid by the central office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the project of complaints, “sixty-six coordinators of parents were laid off”, and “not only due to going beyond”.</seg>

<seg id="1">Completed mission: the Congress reaches an agreement on the question of Libya</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats reached an agreement in Capitol on the question of rising in Lybie.</seg>
<seg id="3">One will have needed a successful rising, the capture and the death of the dictator of long time Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American implication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The committee of the foreign relations of the Senate will have to make a decision next Tuesday, constant by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with the senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their “courage”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“This resolution consists in honouring courage with the Libyans whereas they start to rebuild their country” declared John Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">“It is a support bipartisan for their democratic aspirations.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language is perhaps inoffensive but the debate on Libya was never simple until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, of the legislators of the two parties entered in conflict, like with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aiming at approving or not the military role of the United States in the mission of NATO in Libya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution aiming at authorizing the limited use of American military forces in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The government bill was defeated by a broad margin bipartisane and never was the object of a vote to the Senate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But the same day of the failure of the government bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measurement aiming at reducing the financing of the American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress sufficiently opposed to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut grass under the foot to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The indecision of the Congress was exceeded by the events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell under the insurrectionists in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20th.</seg>
<seg id="15">The mission of NATO officially finished on October 31st.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Senate can now act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee of the foreign relations “congratulates the Libyan people for his courage and its determination extraordinary for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women on the American armed forces and their partners on the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States arrive to a transition irreversible and successful towards the democracy in Libya.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">New measurement will it gain all the support of the Commission of the foreign affairs of the Senate or will divide it the legislators like last June?</seg>
<seg id="20">The senator and chair Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) was opposed to the last version.</seg>
<seg id="21">Its spokesperson declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not read the any last version yet again project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Within Capitol, the Room must vote this week an amendment with the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of the Congress, and some Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measurement, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a vote of floor to the Room or the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other legislators up to now did not succeed in making approve their amendments but it is not without to have tested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to be presented to the Congress, on a large range of subjects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are recurring - the same government bill suggested at the same time with the Room and the Senate - and others are light variations of a precedent.</seg>
<seg id="27">One counts at least 15 versions with the Room only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle which “would control the federal expenditure”.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of these government bills are identical, but give to their supports - in particular the new Republicans who wish to gild to them CV - the chance to praise itself to be “the author” of such a measurement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The law on the control of the budget (Budget Act Control) approved last August required the vote of the Room and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators one voted in favor of a nonconstraining resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which the members of the Congress can be useful, while Jose E. Serrano (Democratic - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two mandates for the presidents.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jess L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multiplicity of amendments ensuring the right to an education of quality and the health care, inter alia subjects.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">One high-graded military present at the official reception, in which also the admiral Mike Mullen took part, chief D " staff of the armies of the United States, saw the role of the troops in a different way.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">“They were presented like a kind of orphan”, wrote thegraded military one in an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.</seg>
<seg id="10">I know it.</seg>
<seg id="11">But this N " was not respect. Just of pity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations which settled between the soldiers and an impassioned but often distant American public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Praises are lavished on the troops for their sacrifices.</seg>
<seg id="14">But they have a certain price, declare some soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="15">The public acts more and more as if it were sorry for the men and women in uniform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“We are not at all victims” declared the sergeant general Sean B. MacFarland, who directed the troops to Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="17">“But it would seem that the only manner of supporting to us is to be locked up in the role of spirits unlucky person.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is about a very significant subject for the military leaders, who do not wish to appear nongrateful or in dissension with the public that they serve.</seg>
<seg id="19">They also carry out that the anger of the returning troops of the war of the Viêt - Nam was quite worse.</seg>

<seg id="23">Others would wonder whether “a veteran in anger and violent one hides under surface” declared Cancian, which fought in Iraq and returned to work with the Government in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">When he sought an employment, he declared, he felt that some people who made him pass the talks asked in a subtle way if it would be able to immediately hold out under the stress of an employment requiring in Washington after his return of the combat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">“When you broach the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions”, colonel Cancian recalls when he speaks to his sons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The difficulties of the soldiers emerge, partly, starting from the American indifference towards the wars.</seg>
<seg id="27">The victories are seldom congratulated by a country also not very familiar with the army and which sees few direct advantages of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</seg>

<seg id="1">The army vis-a-vis the increasing pressure prevailing against the rapists</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, a capital audience will decide if 28 men and women will go in lawsuit against the army for an inaction supposed concerning rapes.</seg>
<seg id="3">If necessary, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the next one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The soldier of 1st class Elizabeth Lyman was old of 25 years and 11 week old enclosure the night when she affirms to be violated by a soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">C " was in October 2008. It returned to its barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dined with a friend, when it met a colleague transporting a beer pack.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked to him whether he could join it in his room to drink glass.</seg>
<seg id="7">“C " was an alarm” declares Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texan one put side its concern.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: not, it is 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="10">“It is of Texas” says it.</seg>
<seg id="11">“I will have had to follow my intuition.”</seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after being entered the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught it from behind, threw by ground and violated, claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will expect with anxiety the legal decision at the time of a historical lawsuit which will proceed in Arlington, in Virginia, and which will decide if a lawsuit carried against the former secretary in defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter are shown not to have stopped the generalization of the rapes within the army, thus going against the constitutional laws of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, the lawsuit implied at the beginning 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to be violated or misused sexually by colleagues soldiers. They also claim that the army did not inquire, continued nor provided justice adapted after the pled attacks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Susan Burke states to be caught some to the soldiers braided, because the problem starts with them.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The army is a vertical structure” says it.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Which are the individuals in position D " to eradicate the culture of reprisals? Leaders.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The lawyer also declares that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, whose majority could be part of future legal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="20">Its strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this business - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to keep the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of defense, for the Department of Defense, directed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, deposited a motion to reject the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">The legal documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defense, and primarily the fact that the army cannot be continued by soldiers in service or not for wounds caused in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme court, called the Doctrines Feres, the Federal government are not responsible for wounds undergone by staff in active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">“The pled evil is inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs” indicate the documents.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Department of Defense refused to make any comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The things changed since the Fifties.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whereas the women still do not have, officially, the right to go to the combat, this distinction is registered only on paper: the frontlines of the recent wars are seldom only male.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important part, in particular to make contact with the local women.</seg>
<seg id="29">Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers died - two thirds in situation of combat.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time for the army to be modernized declares Susan Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is not alone to carry out this combat: three other lawsuits are in hand besides his.</seg>
<seg id="32">With L " school of right of Yale, the center of legal departments of the veterans prepares a business against the four principal military academies to have supposedly to encourage an environment misogynist.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, the foundation with goal nonlucrative Viêt - Nam Veterans of America prepares a lawsuit against the army, while concentrating on the diagnoses of “personality disorders” allotted to the victims of the rapes in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women' S Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for the human rights.</seg>
<seg id="34">Its group brought a lawsuit in December with the Administration of the Veterans, by showing them of discriminatory practices in the manner of treating the requests for advantages for the people stating to have been victims of a sexual assault in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine bills independent from/to each other were introduced in the Congress by a bipartisan mixture senators and representatives, proposer various solutions.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the center of intervention and prevention of the sexual assaults (Sexual Assault Prevention and Réponse Office) of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is well-known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the proper estimate of the Pentagon, this figure accounts for approximately 13.5% of the 19.000 incidents which have occurred this year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report published in March also studies the percentage of legal proceedings: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were the object of a lawsuit - half of the percentage of the civil legal system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs of the business of Susan Burke describe their aggression like the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the business of Lyman, it informs the military Police of the rape less than one hour after the facts.</seg>
<seg id="41">This night, she says, one asked him to tell 11 times in details his rape with various police officers, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">It underwent a “grater kit” (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of its attacker - had with a cut with its arm - was found in its bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge, with a lawsuit during which one earlier questions it on his sexual relationships with his boyfriend the day of his aggression.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people testified as character references for the author to the crime, which ended up being discharged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“I remember the day when the verdict was returned” declares Elizabeth Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">“I believed that I was going to start to have contractions. I put myself to shout after the court.”</seg>
<seg id="47">“I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember to have said to my commander “Ce was not his lawsuit but mine”.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making it inapt for the service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, it was returned under terms less than honourable, preventing it from receiving unspecified advantage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The Lyman business and other plaintiffs will advance or not, it is a long story, declares John Turley, law professor with the Faculty of Law of the university of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, he points out, “with my opinion, they should be able to advance”.</seg>
<seg id="52">Only these doctrines criticized since its introduction are between them and a verdict.</seg>
<seg id="53">I always criticized the Feres doctrines.</seg>
<seg id="54">The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrent posed by the responsibility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">“The chances are heavily against them… but it is important that they test”, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="56">These things change only when the goods have the will to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the lawsuit does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will gather his hundreds of other plaintiffs for other lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="58">“We will continue to beat us against the army on this question as long as there will not be reform” affirms it.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who informs of his opinions anti-immigration on line.</seg>
<seg id="3">Monday, Breivik, which admitted being taken of a fatal madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with its first lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whereas Breivik has only acts, it was far from the being on the cyberspace: it had passed most of time preceding the attack on its computer, to discuss with some the million nationalists who support the groups of far right on the sites of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wish more on these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But how to find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">Easy… You connect to Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“We realized that it N " was not so difficult that to find them”, declares Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a report published recently by the think tank of DEMONSTRATIONS on the digital populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Facebook abounds in as well personal information, affirms Jamie Bartlett, as the researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find the people whom they seek with a scientific precision - the way in which the mercaticians do it since years.</seg>
<seg id="10">L " equips with Jamie Bartlett discovered that a half-million members are fans of the groups of far right in Europe. It targeted them with announcements, but instead of connecting them to a new group or produced, the announcements invited the users to answer an investigation. The asked questions related to their level of education, their attitudes vis-a-vis violence and their optimism as for their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">While making contact with these people thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues could question 10.000 partisans of 14 parties of far right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.</seg>
<seg id="12">“It is a new way of were research”, Jamie Bartlett declares.</seg>
<seg id="13">Certain results are not at all surprising: the partisans on line of the groups of right-hand side are rather men, young people and against immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But surprisingly, “those which associate activism on line and out-line are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent one that those which remain behind their screen of computer.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">L " study of DEMONSTRATIONS is only one example on the way in which Facebook became the new tool impossible to circumvent between the hands of the scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The think tanks, the researchers in medicine and the political economists use the site to study all the subjects which touch the health questions like the social tendencies, thanks to “I like”, publications on the walls and updates of statutes.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users who add on average three contents per day, the “supernova of the data” generates an explosion as regards research, increasing the number of research tasks whose name of the site appears in the title from almost 800% compared to the five last years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For certain researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it enables you to study people whom you could not approach in the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Front, when you try to carry out investigations into the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“You were to go to the party, but they would never have authorized you to enter”, Jamie Bartlett declares.</seg>
<seg id="21">“Facebook avoids all that - you have access to their information directly. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the site could offer a means of identifying and to deal with the medical and social problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of the university of Wisconsin-Madison, and his/her colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their exploits in a state about intoxication were likely enormously more to be alcoholic than the discrete students on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the advisers, could supervise the site and intervene to possibly help a student about which the statute would too often speak about alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="25">“You cannot deal with a problem if you do not diagnose it”, Dimitri Christakis, joint author of Megan Moreno and director of the center for health, the behavior and the development of the children at the Research institute for the children located at Seattle, affirm Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">“We know how to identify the children with risks, and which would not be in another not recognized case.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also reaches constantly information of its users.</seg>
<seg id="28">L " equips with the site which deals with the data studied the statistics concerning the situation in love and the day with the saint Valentine, rate of participation with the elections of mid--mandate of 2010 and one index of national happiness (thanks to information only available - the champions of digital freedom supported for a long time that the site could make available its treasure of data to other people at ends of research).</seg>
<seg id="29">But the users of Facebook know that the site, that they observe them or not like that - in return for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is to thousands of kilometers, the site is authorized to reach your information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what does it occur when the users of Facebook belong to an investigation about which they did not even intend to speak?</seg>
<seg id="31">Whereas the researchers have instructions well defined as for the manner of differently collecting information than via the Internet, it is anything else on line.</seg>
<seg id="32">“I do not believe that a large number of users already thought of the fact that a researcher can study their profile” declares Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 that it carried out by observing the Facebook walls of his students.</seg>
<seg id="33">“As much as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then the question comes from methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even without passing by Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.</seg>
<seg id="37">“What you say on Facebook and what you make in reality are two completely different things”, Neil Selwyn affirms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">This is why, in spite of his experiment as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a scratch pad and a pen remain the best tools than one can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">“Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with people,” declares it.</seg>
<seg id="40">“The social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social one, it is not in front of a computer.”</seg>

<seg id="1">“Cold and inhuman”: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik, the man having admitted to have organized the two attacks which caused 77 deaths in Norway this summer, described itself as a combatant “of resistance” during his first appearance to the lawsuit which proceeds in Oslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Templars of Norway”, he explains in front of a courtroom filled of 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">“With regard to the competence of the court, I challenge it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism.”</seg>
<seg id="5">“I admit the facts but I do not plead guilty.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik lasting this monolog because he “did not want to leave him opportunity of using this lawsuit to express his opinions.”</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, which brought with him a speech on paper, speech to the parents of the victims at the end of the audience.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nesheim judge also asked the Police to keep Breivik in detention twelve weeks moreover, prohibited to him to speak with the media during four weeks and informed it that the authorities would supervise very close all the visits and correspondences during eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">About thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the audience.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind the bars.</seg>
<seg id="11">All took part in the audience with an aim of seeing the end of the lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I found it cold and inhuman” a survivor of Utoya to Norwegian TV channel NRK declared.</seg>
<seg id="13">“I N " stays not at ease, but I have personally a little advanced after having seen and having heard the suspect.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Dressed in a funereal clothing and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional during all the lawsuit. It looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes while entering and outgoing of the court.</seg>
<seg id="15">In spite of the strange idea according to which Breivik belongs to a vast movement of “resistance”, the judge determined that it was not insane. He also declared that there is no proof that it has acts with accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">The attacks of July 22nd thus seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which will perhaps comfort some of them.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that does not reduce sorrow nor confusion felt by all the nation.</seg>
<seg id="18">“I will have preferred that it resembles a monster, but it is not the case”, a relative of a victim declared.</seg>
<seg id="19">“That would have been much easier.”</seg>

<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the televised series “Triumph of the Nerds”. This series recalls the birth of the computer, and it assoit during more than one hour with Steve Jobs for long and rare conversation.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time, that made approximately 10 years that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He worked already hard on his new data-processing company NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whereas a small portion of the discussion with Cringely is used in Nerds, he declares that the principal copies disappeared in transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This video, slightly gone up, is the film base the 68 minute old entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be diffused with the cinema Wednesday and Thursday next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For somebody of known to hate the deepened talks, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and his sales strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly attentive.</seg>
<seg id="12">On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long moment after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds from reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, with an aim of giving a precise answer.</seg>
<seg id="13">One also discovers moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs re-appears, where it seems impatient to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him blows of elbow to make it accelerate and pass on questions or subjects of greatter importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Filmed before L " era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, one curiously finds an aspect prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers of good or bad at the other companies and fact share of his own vision on the future of data processing.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a thing of reading the posthumous evaluations of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of crude and of inspiring on the man whom we see here, the anxious dreamer the day before the size.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has a vision on the way in which the things can be and must be.</seg>
<seg id="17">He explains them then the mets of continuation in work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Here a fast summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">On the way in which he learned how to direct a company:</seg>
<seg id="20">“During all these years, I always asked: 'Why you make the things?” and the answers are constantly the same ones: “oh, simply because they should be done. “”</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody knows why, nobody thinks in-depth of the things in a company.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is what I discovered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Steve Jobs continues by giving details on his efforts aiming at simplifying accountancy at Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Perplexed as for the way in which the costs were recorded - one often begin with a “standard cost” evaluated at sight of nose, then adjusted with a “variation” - it developed an automated factory which guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On opportunity of playing a turn with the Pope:</seg>
<seg id="26">Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the “Blue Box” which it created with Steve Wozniak - an apparatus which was used for pirating the phone networks and telephoning free in long-distance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The apparatus was the object of many first writings, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">It describes the way in which him and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, while passing a call then while being connected of an AT&amp\;T network to another whole while circumventing as many satellites as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">“We wrapped the ball of various things half a dozen times and you howled in the public phone and that arrived to you later one minute at the public phone of at side,” explains Jobs while laughing.</seg>
<seg id="30">“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could ourselves create something able to control billion dollars of infrastructures in the whole world. ”</seg>
<seg id="31">We did not know large thing both, but we knew to invent a small thing able to control large things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have one day existed without that.</seg>
<seg id="32">Steve Jobs continues by telling a marvellous turn that him and Wozniak developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box right in the middle of the night while being made pass for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whereas several members of the catholic hierarchy are convened in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in giggle right before the Pope himself is awaked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On its love with technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett):</seg>
<seg id="35">With L " 12 years age, with hunting for the spare parts to manufacture a frequency meter, it seeks the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and a telephone call passes to him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after their 20 minutes conversation, Steve Jobs obtains a job of part-time summer at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">“That had a remarkable influence on me. C " was the only company which I had seen at this age and that formed my definition of a company and the way in which the employees are treated.”</seg>
<seg id="38">Steve Jobs became one of the HP employees thereafter to visit the research laboratories of the company, located at Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop ever designed.”</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as large as a bag, had a small cathode ray tube. I fell in love from there.</seg>
<seg id="40">The teenager that J " stays is turned over to HP and started to write programs for this machine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On the improvisation of the innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">Several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a blow of head.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the beginning of his career, whereas it settles to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">Working at only 30 days of credit, it had to deal with the assembly as of the delivery of the finished apparatuses.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered to develop a mouse of computer:</seg>
<seg id="46">“I remember large arguments… one shouted me above by claiming that it would take me five years [to manufacture a mouse which would cost $300]. I had of it enough, I left and went to see an originator.”</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse which we could manufacture for $15 and who proved incredibly reliable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On the large companies which blow themselves:</seg>
<seg id="49">Well before it revives Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way in which many industrial leaders were going to be mistaken and lose the control of their market share.</seg>
<seg id="50">“Let us admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and afterwards?”</seg>
<seg id="51">You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the company does not meet more success.</seg>
<seg id="52">The sales and marketing can make it evolve, therefore [they are these types of people] which ends up directing the companies and the staff specialized in product are put at L " variation of decision makings.</seg>
<seg id="53">The genius of product which led to this position of monopoly is completely rotted by the people who cannot imagine to design a good product compared to a bad product - necessary manual work.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is what occurred at Xerox…</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox could have held all computing industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It could have made ten times its size current. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the Nineties…</seg>
<seg id="57">They tore off the defeat with the victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On the innovation like forms artistic:</seg>
<seg id="59">“An enormous part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product… as you develop this idea, it changes and grows.”</seg>
<seg id="60">You learn enormously on its subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are compromises to make… Certain things which you cannot make, the electrons can it, glass, the robots, the factories too.</seg>
<seg id="62">You must keep thousands of things to the spirit (these concepts) by assembling them the ones with the others.</seg>
<seg id="63">Lastly, the decisions are made by personal taste. It is a question of trying to expose you to best produced than the men created, and to try to bring these things to the product which you create.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said one day that the good artists copy and that the large artists fly.</seg>
<seg id="65">We always have shame to fly of excellent ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked above were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best data-processing scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">If it is not for computer science, they would have made extraordinary things in another field.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dine with adversaries on the right of health whereas the court meets</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The day when the Supreme court meets behind closed doors examining the political question of discord, namely if the opposition to the law of President Obama of health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at the time of a dinner sponsored by the law firm which will defend the business before the high court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference aiming at discussing the petitions for examination.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the business in question related to a lawsuit brought by 26 States disputing the ambitious reform of the health care voted by the Congress last year, a law which was a rallying point for the preserving militants with the national scale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected next March, and the result will be probably likely to support the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full rise at the time when the decision of the court will be rendered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will be held in front of the court and will argue on the rejection of the law, will be probably Paul Clement, who was used like Solicitor General of the United States during the administration as George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, belonged to the two dozen cabinets which helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalistic Company (Federalist Society), a group of long time dedicated to defend the preserving legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another cabinet which sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the partnerships which disputed the law, the National federation of the independent companies (National Federation of Independent Business).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presents an enormous financial challenge in the result of the litigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held with a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the court on the business.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was there, inter alia, Mitch McConnell, republican signal of the Senate and declared adversary of the law of health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests star with the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalistic Company during years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is nothing which goes against the rules of deontology.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the judges are exempted of code of conduct which governs the actions of the federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they were it, they would undoubtedly argue by the code of Canon 4C, which stipulates: “A judge can witness collections of funds of the organizations related to the right and others although the judge cannot be intervening, a guest of honor, or being reproduced on the program of such an event”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms of the business, like for a company having a massive financial interest, sufficed to alarm the activists of governmental ethics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“This violation of ethics and superb indifference with regard to the code contradicts the declarations of several judges whom the Court respects the same rules applicable to all the other federal judges”, declared Bob Edgar, president de Common Cause.</seg>
<seg id="19">“The judges drank and dined and with a collection on funds on official reception with lawyers who have cases in authority in front of the court”.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds of this event dismount any claim of impartiality, and are unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for the critics affirming that they too easily mix the business of the court with the diary of groups such as the Federalistic Company.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the woman of Thomas, Ginni, is militant preserving of high-profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In addition, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was Solicitor General of the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law were carried to the level of the county court.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its criticisms put pressure so that Kagan is challenged to hear the case, saying that it had been invested too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan did not give any indication that it would do it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boeing records an order record of 18 billion dollars for airliners</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Emirates airline company orders 50 Boeing 777, airliners bi--corridors, with the possibility of buying 20 of more of them.</seg>
<seg id="3">Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners at Oman Air, a market estimated at more than one billion dollar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">There is nothing extraordinary so that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is on the other hand a whole business when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing planes and that the amount of these 50 planes reaches the sum record of 18 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Quite as incredible is which Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing goldmine of future orders of planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">In forecasts published Monday, the company of Chicago estimates that the airline companies of the Middle East will need in the 20 next years for 2,520 planes for a total bill for 450 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">During the weekend, Boeing informed of the ordering of commercial planes most expensive of its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi--corridors.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the Emirates airline company based in Dubai who placed this Pharaonic order.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boeing announced with the Aeronautical Living room of Dubai of 2011 that the airline company is also likely to buy 20 planes moreover, which would raise the full amount of the order to 26 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On another side, Boeing stated Monday that the Oman Air company ordered six Boeing 787-8, called Dreamliners, a model which flatters important savings in fuel and conveniences for the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="12">The amount of these six apparatuses S " raises to more than one billion dollar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">“It is clearly very positive for Boeing,” declared Neal Dihora, analyst of Morningstar.</seg>
<seg id="14">“These customers in particular have an immense value.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the Middle East, the oil producing countries have many of their airline companies.</seg>
<seg id="16">They thus have not only the means of paying these planes, but a rise of the price of the fuel - usually prejudicial for the airline companies because it represents their most significant expenses - would not be so harmful for them since the country would earn money with the rise of the oil price.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or to differ their orders from planes when the oil price increases, Dihora announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“They have a natural covering of risk”, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The ordering of Emirates reinforces the prevalence of Boeing on the market of the planes large-carriers and assistance to slow down the attempt at encroachment of the Airbus competitor with its A350 plane.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The victory of Boeing to the Air Show sometimes happens four months after the announcement of Airbus to defer the beginnings of the largest version of A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="21">Airbus pushes back its beginnings to increase by it the push following the request of its customers to increase his load capacity and its autonomy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The actions of the Boeing company increased by 1.5% to reach the 67.94 dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1">The sister of the Mexican president obviously beaten with the elections of Michoacán</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Luisa Maria Calderon declares that the drug traffickers helped his adversary Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race at the post of governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The sister of president Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her attempt at access to the functions of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she declared Monday that the drug traffickers supported one of its adversaries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the top of the race at the post of governor of this State of the west.</seg>
</p>	
<p>
<seg id="5">“The intervention of the organized crime during all the process of vote and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country”, Luisa Maria Calderon announced to the radio during an interview Monday following the elections.</seg>
<seg id="6">“They threatened our candidates, our campaign organizers… They seized the ballot boxes, installed road blocks… and obliged people to vote” for the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The PRI controlled Mexico during seventy years jusqu " to lose the presidency in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it organizes its return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.</seg>
<seg id="9">The PRI hopes to gain L " election presidential in July.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Vallejo seems to be himself dissociated only little of Calderon, which was at the top of the surveys before the day of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">Calderon, candidate of the conservative party of his brother, the Party National action, or SIDE, refused to recognize Vallejo like winner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently occupies the functions of governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 for this divided and unhappy left.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of L " State, contradicted any bond with the drug traffickers and highly advised with the other candidates to accept the results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Michoacán was dominated a long time by the cartels of drug specialized in the traffic of marihuana, heroin and méthamphétamine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is about L " Country of origin of president Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against the traffickers in December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, violence persisted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">One week before the elections a mayor of the SIDE was assassinated whereas he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and of many candidates gave up the countryside by fear locally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">However, for the PRI, as corrupted as the elections of Michoacán seem, a victory will help the party in its dash.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The man whom one waits to represent the PRI in the race with the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and declared, “I think that this victory is very encouraging for the next year.”</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Severe warnings of the Pentagon on the potential reductions of defense</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Secretary in Defense, Leon Panetta, made assemble the pressure on the Congress Monday, informing that the imminent automatic budget cuts would sap the national security. He started a financial chain reaction of the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, via the gatherings of civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon digests already 450 billion dollars of reductions for the next decade, but fears now that an additional amount of 600 dollars or more compressions is imminent if the Congress does not manage an agreement on the expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“The impacts of these reductions would be dévastateurs for the ministry”, declared Panetta in a letter with the Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He declared that the failure of the Congress to be managed a resulting budgetary agreement in what one calls sequestration, would involve 23% of reductions as well as freezing many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">“Such an important reduction, applied thus without understanding, would return most our ships and of our impracticable construction projects - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and to carry seriously reached to the other efforts of modernization”, Panetta writing with the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">“We would be also constrained to separate us from a certain number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, should almost certainly send to us civilians on leave without wages in order to achieve the goal.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“These changes would shake the faith of those which support our soldiers and would damage our preparation seriously.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The reductions would touch possibly the fighting troops, continues Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">“Although the financing in time of war of the accounts of the operations of contingency abroad is not directly touched by sequestration, the efforts of war would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets”, Panetta informed.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Staff contracting would be reduced, involving delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract which support the war”.</seg>
<seg id="12">“Staff managing the wages would be reduced, involving delays of payment to the suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disturbed”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators had written in Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry for Defense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have would start a fast decline of the United States as an uncontested world chief of the military power”.</seg>
<seg id="15">“We are savagely opposed to this Draconian action”, the senators in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter of Panetta declared.</seg>
<seg id="16">“It is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not that which us should impose”.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Sequestration is a threat for the interests of national security of the United States, and it should not have to occur”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon of reductions, remains to see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta was increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even if he arrived itself at the most station of the Pentagon cumulating of the years of expertise on the budget to the Congress and the White House and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">With a press conference the past week, the secretary with Defense painted a dark painting of what could occur - a soldier with a shell, but not of core.</seg>
<seg id="21">“It is a ship without sailors”.</seg>
<seg id="22">“It is a brigade without balls”.</seg>
<seg id="23">“It is a fighter plan, without enough trained pilots”.</seg>
<seg id="24">“It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs which do not have enough trained soldiers able to achieve the mission”, Panetta at the time of its opening remarks declared to the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">“It is a depressed, badly prepared force and incompetent to face potential adversaries”.</seg>
<seg id="26">“De facto, it invites to the aggression.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an addendum with its letters with McCain and Graham, Panetta stated specifically how new reductions could “generate important operational risks: deadline for reply to the crises, conflicts and catastrophes\; severe limits with our capacity to deploy us and engage us in the world\; and risks assumed unacceptable in operations of future combat”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta declared that some of the more great projects of defense could pass to the chopper, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">This list included Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new laid down bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new vehicle of ground, which would replace Humvee of the army and the marine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">To put an end to the development and the tests of F35 could generate 80 billion dollars economies over 10 years, but its partisans say that it is a crucial step of improvement and answer to the potential threats of China and other rivals.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to locate a lie</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A glance on the recent cuffs indicates to which point the fraud and the lie are omnipresent in the daily life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The republican candidate with the presidency Hermann Cain is occupied exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women\; each side showing the other to lie.</seg>
<seg id="4">The administrators of PEN State were accused of perjury to have allegedly covered with the reports according to which a trainer of football to the retirement attacked boys sexually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Last week French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a microphone open affirming to US president Barack Obama that Israeli the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lie destroyed careers and convulsed of the countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The member of the Congress of New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, passed for an idiot by quickly emitting the denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former candidate with the presidential election John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of the campaigns related to the cover of an extramarital connection.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then, none of that which lived the history will never forget the media circus that president Bill Clinton started while lying at the time of its second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The accounts of cheating to the tests of the school and the university are legion.</seg>
<seg id="11">There were cases where the teachers gave the answers of the tests to the pupils in order to show themselves well on their evaluations of performance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The mentors who should teach the opposite send the message according to which lie and the cheating is acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much fraud do we meet?</seg>
<seg id="14">Over a day given, the studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, much of those are pious lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study showed that the foreigners lie themselves to three recoveries in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">To detect or locate lies is an essential competence that each one must acquire, at the same time for personal reasons and professional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a board game similar to, let us say, of the riddles, where the objective is to exclaim: “I had you”, the detection of the fraud is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected during six last decades in prestigious universities having undertaken an in-depth research such projects, in particular in psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">One of the search results is that the oldest myths on the lie were demystified.</seg>
<seg id="20">The liars look you in the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do not stammer, redden or are not always agitated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Not from it to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.</seg>
<seg id="23">A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the microphone-expressions facial, the formation of the question and the response time.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years to examine scientific results in the vast body and always emergent of knowledge on the fraud, and it is clear that the detection of the fraud is a modern competence which is easy to learn how and useful to surf in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include in particular the recruiting, the interviews, the negotiation or management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The good liars are skilful with good lira the others, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how the others perceive them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We know according to research which the extroverts lie more than the introverts, than the men to more say lies “centered on them” whereas the women say more lies “centered on the others” - usually to protect the feelings from somebody - that the married people less often lie to their partners than the nonmarried people (but that the lies which they tell tend to be enormous).</seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived like a non-believer, the others will feel less guilty to lie you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How can you say if somebody lies?</seg>
<seg id="29">First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is what is called “to establish the data reference mark”.</seg>
<seg id="31">That helps to provide a point of reference to measure the later changes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, vocal quality.</seg>
<seg id="33">You must know if somebody stirs up his feet normally permanently in order not to make unjust accusations when you see it stirring up the feet in the middle of the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then seek indices of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="35">Regard these indices as red flags, not of the evidence of the fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Misleading people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, to lean towards an exit, to change posture to a significant degree or to present a relief of “post-interview” - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions passed.</seg>
<seg id="37">The interrogative ones indicate often wrongfully that maintenance is finished just to seek to start the reaction post-interview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Also, made attention with the vocabulary of your subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">Famous Scott Peterson skidded while using the past while claiming that his assassinated wife was alive, starting a national research to find it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The misleading individuals can also use an outdistanced language: “I did not have sexual relationships with this woman… Miss Lewinsky” or to entirely repeat a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="41">The verbal indicators most common are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Somebody can use much “set language” at the time of his answer to a difficult question: “Well… to tell truth… if I remember goods… to my knowledge.”</seg>
<seg id="43">That rather makes the answer perceptive than factual and is often a red flag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of competences to recognize the fraud is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">These competences will improve the chances of whoever to avoid the victimization by swindlers in their professional life and personal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The plan of discussed pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A few days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a project of pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - causing the anger of the trade unions while alleviating the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project to give it on the rails.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">TransCanada declared Monday evening that it will move the pipeline project out of the ecologically significant zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is trustful that the project all the same will gain its approval.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The company announced the decision at the time of a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="5">The official one of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, affirms that the company remains trustful that it will end up obtaining the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">That made following the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision of granting of a federal license for the project until it receives from new studies of potential routes making it possible to avoid the zones of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, of vast sources of subsoil water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">“It is a true way forwards”, indicates Lee Terry, a republican of Nebraska with Fox News.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new examination of the environment ordered by the State Department would have probably pushed back any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the civils servant deny the implication of the policy in the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama, in a written declaration last week, described the decision as being the decision of the State Department, and to him expressed her support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The pipeline of 2.735 km would extend from Canada towards the Gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would transport 700.000 barrels per day since province of Alberta towards the refineries of Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">With this intention, it would have to cross six States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It is haï by the ecologists, but liked by working groups, which bet on 20,000 employment considered related to the pipeline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan put pressure that a law for force the distance of the area of Sand Hills and the aquifer Ogallala, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The environmental impact study in the course of the State Department found that the project would pose only limited negative environmental impacts, but the industry of energy declared that the general inspector of the ministry ordered an investigation distinct from the process of examination, centered into two questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser of countryside of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.</seg>
<seg id="17">The other is to know if a company which was engaged to conduct the initial study were an inappropriate choice from its relation with TransCanada.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Court validates “the analogical cut” in Mexico in 2015</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The substitution of announce analogical by the digital ones is one of the exchanges more important than the world suffered last the years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Supreme court of Justice of Nation (SCJN) nonsuited the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies formulated against the order in Council which advances the aforementioned “analogical cut” of 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not joined together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, Ci-included the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that president Felipe Calderón did not exceed his attributions when it emitted the decree which details the actions to be followed to concretize the terrestrial transition on television digital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was nonsuited not to have reached the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court comes to a conclusion about the constitutionality or not-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The project of sentence, worked out by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree like not-constitutional, because of fact that the regulation as regards radio and television is an attribution reserved by law at the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in infringment of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">With this argument, so much the Senate as the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to dispute the decree and by admitting the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by this one for the digital transition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The plenary session of the ministers solved to also nonsuit the complaint formulated by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which the minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In his intervention, the minister chair said that it was not agreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general standards measurements so that the public administration prepares there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">“I do not consider either that if it did it one would affect the autonomy of the regulating body”, and it recalled that the planning of the public policies in strategic domains as the sector of telecommunications is the responsibility for the federal Executive, which has as a constitutional mandate the direction of the State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The substitution of announce analogical by announce digital is one of the most important changes that the world suffered last the years and that is translated in a better exploitation of the radioelectric spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more chains.</seg>

<seg id="1">One analyzes the possibility of a calculation “votes by vote” with Michoacán</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the data put in obviousness by PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor are only 27 percent, even without entering the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total official reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The possibility of the calculation “votes by vote” is a reality with regard to the electoral lawsuit this year with Michoacán, where according to the data put in obviousness by the Program of Preliminary Election results (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without entering the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total official reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this direction, the president of the General advice of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María of los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, pointed out that a few days ago, the past November 9th, the electoral body approved a series of hot lines to harmonize the local standards with reforms federal out of electoral matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One will remember that Michoacán approved neither its Political Constitution nor its Electoral code of State or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the Congress of the State approved reform them little before which finishes the legal delay so that this electoral lawsuit can come into effect and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication in the intended deadlines by the Law of the Official journal of the State, with the argument of that it had some objections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The same November 9th, the Supreme Court of justice of Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Power Legislative and qualified like “invalid and illegal” the vote of the agent of the state for the constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right “to sanction them or dispute”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Interviewed on the possibility of the “vote by vote”, María of los Ángeles Llanderal declared that thanks to the approval of the corresponding hot lines by the General advice of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total calculations votes by the local electoral body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Thus, the calculation partial of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the official reports do not coincide\; there is no official report of poll and calculation in the file of the ballot box is not in the president of this one\; or there are errors or obvious deteriorations of the official reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the total calculation of the votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election could be carried out when there is an index owing to the fact that the difference between the supposed candidate gaining of the respective election and that which obtained the second place in the poll is equal or by lower part of a point of percentage\; on condition that at the beginning of the session exists a petition express of the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the announced candidates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The total calculation of the poll can be carried out as so at the end of the common calculation it results as the difference between the candidate supposed winner and that of the second place is equal or lower than a point of percentage, on condition that which there exists the petition express of the representative of the political party which the candidate left second, case in which one will exclude the electoral packages which were object of the partial calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It should be mentioned that is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 pourcent, even without entering the votes of 129 of the 923 total official reports.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The “framework is now well traced”, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti supplemented the process to form a government in less than three days, in a time more reduced than normally, while Italy fights a political crisis and financial which pushed the costs of its debt on levels impossible to support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity required by the European leaders to recover confidence in Italy which had been affected.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To go to Costa Rica is a dream which became reality for us too.</seg>
<seg id="11">This one is our second time in South America and Centrale and until now that was imposing.</seg>
<seg id="12">I passed to Costa Rica only once the vacancies\; it is a so beautiful country and I think that we will be able to spend a few days there.</seg>
<seg id="13">That thus affects us to carry our music over there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion towards the group, the fans live with intensity the former days.</seg>
<seg id="15">Which is your message for your more enthusiastic followers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you to remain beside us during all these years.</seg>
<seg id="17">It were necessary 21 years so that we arrive to Costa Rica\; thank you to have waited so much and we are sorry owing to the fact that such an amount of time had to pass until this concert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people say already that its concert is the larger show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Does that add a little pressure to your visit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the shows larger than we offered during the last 21 years took place in the two last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We offered one two gigantic shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that formatted to us for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are really very impatient to produce us there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We like this country, we like to make surfing and the jungle\; for the two things, Costa Rica east one of the best countries of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How did you discover Costa Rica and her waves to make surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We have many friendly surfers and I have very a good friend which lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible over there.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends were always going to make surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, beside Mexico, is great places to make surfing\; thus taught we it, through the races which like surfing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">By seeing the round, to you aves offered enormous shows, with much of songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As we never occurred over there, we do not have any restriction with regard to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to make the best possible show, with a large variety of songs\; we will try to interpret two songs of each album and to offer to our fans a good and various repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat the repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">With what does have that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe that it is partially because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, therefore it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret each evening.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the repertoire which we did not interpret any more for a very long time, that helps us to remain concentrated and surprises us because that points out the reasons to us for which we like these songs and that we can have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">That made that the show is more interesting for us and consequently I think that it becomes also more interesting for people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this round, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="37">While looking at behind, is it difficult to believe all that you made a success of?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="39">Initially, I believe that none us had thought that we were going to form a great rock'n'roll group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes that seems a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We continue to tell our blessings and the fact of being able to continue to make music together affects us much.</seg>
<seg id="41">We like and we adore to create music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky of going to places of the world to which we always wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">The things could not better go for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What means for you the fact of having been a basic element in the creation of the grunge one?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">That was always an honor for us to form part of this group of great groups.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are very friendly with people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is not very common.</seg>
<seg id="48">From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and it is an honor for us to form part of the group of Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="50">We still play with some of them from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="51">The last year we took part in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their round, therefore we are lucky to be still friendly with all them and it is an honor for us to form part of this sound of Seattle which has emerges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is as very strange as a group as yours is maintained plain and with the same members for so much of time.</seg>

<seg id="53">Yes, four among us were together during 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much more time than much of groups last normally.</seg>
<seg id="54">Initially, I believe that we all are lucky to be still in life and, in second place, we are worried all for the others.</seg>
<seg id="55">We all are close friend and grace has that there are musical boulevards which give freedom to each one to test.</seg>

<seg id="58">How do you find a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">As we grew, that was easier for us to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We ensure ourselves owing to the fact that we do not spend too much time in round because it is easy to fall into this play from the great multitudes and people who like your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">If it is not forgotten that people are there for the music, that help us not to forget that it is necessary to respect the music and what brought it, without putting the fact at the head that one is famous and a rock'n'roll star, which really does not interest in any among us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think that we wrote good songs and at that beginning was imposing.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were a group during almost three years and we did not publish a disc before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).</seg>
<seg id="65">There were many frustrations for the fact that it lasted if little and most important is the fact that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) which started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photograph I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, that was always a pleasure of working, of laughing, of speaking about the music, football and much other things with him.</seg>

<seg id="68">Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for this reason chose it to you for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production sent to us videos with various proposals and that one was the group which we liked more, therefore we are impatient to see what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very distracting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">For what always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">This one is a question for ED (Eddie Vedder), therefore I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="72">It is him who sings it and I believe that it makes it with the first words that it imagines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">As are bass player, which his influences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">There is so much…</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the first of which I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Cleans, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski…</seg>
<seg id="76">There are as well influences, as I could speak all the afternoon on the bass players whom I adore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How did Pearl Jam succeed has to maintain raising the grunge one in spite owing to the fact that this one is not any more with the mode?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I believe that we all we feel disconnected a little from the grunge word.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think about it, that points out the groups to me which I have just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those which have emerges at the same time and, if that is raising now, I believe that is marvellous, because it is a music which is worth the sorrow to listen and the groups as Mudhoney make the best music now than ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the beginning, its music had more obscure contents and maintaining this one became more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">With what does have this change?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album which seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End gold Just Breathe qualified like very obscure songs, even if those can sound a little positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">With both, when ED played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and those are deeply obscure songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I think that if you grow and there is a trauma in your life and you lose with a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, undoubtedly, represent that for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">I also think that one can also be happy and even as that one can make obscure music.</seg>

<seg id="1">Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects coincide on the appropriateness of the convocation beyond the polemic on the fees</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The municipal competition based on the 16 doors again begins the debate on the role of Collserola to Barcelona</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">About the middle of the years '80, in full apogee of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed small posters of promotion of Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The booklet defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, it contained also a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of much of people, limits it higher of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being alone which is not directed towards the North-South axis, the if not high one (mountain) - low (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The qualification of Collserola as natural park is with the advantage of this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reference was not any more Central Park if not Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the bear Yogi.</seg>
<seg id="10">That was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a méga-competition composed by 16 contest for all the access doors to Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">A door gives to the idea of park, without any doubt.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is that, or somebody wants to put doors at the field.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question appears all alone: Collserola: park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The contest, so much with regard to its organization as with regard to the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a recurrent theme whose two members of this former caste of elected officials speak when they are recognized in an elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">And that is precisely one of the rare opinions on which three architects of Barcelona coincide, university professors, who presented themselves there.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is convenient.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán, after approaching the face littoral “it is necessary” to discuss on “the face of mountain” because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of green blocks of houses was not led to end.</seg>
<seg id="19">“It is necessary to leave the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Inter alia things for its great accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex”, the verdict the architect gave for whom the title of “doors of Collserola” contains a “trap lexicon”: one should not think of those “like the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of certain zones in which it is necessary to act”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experiment in the urban world, qualifies the proposal like “intellectual challenge” with “some dangers”.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dangers which are derived from “the uncertainty of the projection of public space” after the experiment lived in the years '80 and which had in the zone of the Forum “its song of swan”.</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the proper delimitation of the borders on which one can build.</seg>
<seg id="25">“To limit something means to establish the following step already”, i.e., its going beyond.</seg>
<seg id="26">“It is necessary to think of new urban instruments, of planning, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">While being held more with the question, Modol opine that, while simplifying, the slope of the area El Valles de Collserola “can be heard like a park, that of Barcelona, not”.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol recalls that there exists already a job done by the Employers of Collserola which “should not be lost”, while thanking for opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project “as of the first moment”.</seg>
<seg id="29">Moreover, he hears that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct which allows the architects to enter the debate, but “doubt” if this profiles technical must direct the multidisciplinary teams (“a whole success”, he says) that one has to create: “Us, the architects, should be only one instrument”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question which gives the title of this part is complex, bus of the bases of the contest it misses a comprehensive view of Collserola: “One convened 16 transverse contests - known as-it - in the mountain-MER direction, but there is not a longitudinal reading which sees and understands the zone as a whole”.</seg>
<seg id="31">This made, at least in this case, which he chose to take part in the 16 contest.</seg>
<seg id="32">In another manner, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the close door.</seg>
<seg id="33">In its opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the band immediately above than that of Ronda de Dalt should envisage, in all its extension, a zone of equipment which carries out a soft transition between the city and the green.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives communicates the details of the plane crash in which his life the secretary of the Government lost, Francisco Blake and other seven people</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which his life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora lost and other seven people, indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to test an emergency landing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot noted that the conditions of climate were adequate to fly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“The elements which seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees with 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It also informed owing to the fact that the unit was conceived for 19 people, therefore this one met the requirements necessary to transport staff.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, he said that the investigations made in the zone of impacts do not bring back the appearance of parts on the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">“In a research one reported that there are not parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact arised in a structural way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ground presented a seven pante to 30 degrees of inclination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For the moment, the secretary ensured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible\; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In its turn, Gilberto López Meyer, chief executive officer of Airports and Services Auxiliary ensured that the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the State Majeur Presidential functioned of speed of cruiser and that occurred on an ascending soft ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">“This information supports the assumption of an operation normal cruiser at the time of impacts”, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">During the press conference, the holder of SCT, Pérez Jácome, enumerated six significant components in the investigation:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Visual flight:</seg>
<seg id="15">According to normative aeronautics, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Weather conditions:</seg>
<seg id="17">The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions on takeoff, and as the aircraft advanced towards the zone bordering between DF and the State on Mexico there were layers of nebulosity to low height.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Selected roads:</seg>
<seg id="19">It is probable qu " because of conditions of nebulosity the crew sought a weaker zone height and more visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Localization of impacts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coordinates of impacts and the last registration of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before impacts it had neither loss of control there nor deterioration of the flight trajectory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft in a reduced zone:</seg>
<seg id="23">Information available until now makes it possible to suppose that impacts it took place on a right and side trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="24">The model of dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft makes it possible to suppose that the helicopter ran up the ground under conditions of structural integrity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">One did not detect traces of fire or explosion:</seg>
<seg id="26">In the place of the disaster there is always no trace in the remainders of the aircraft of a kind of explosion or fire.</seg>
<seg id="27">The last results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">During work of ground one found parts of the aircraft to a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above mean level of the sea, the ground presented a slope which goes since seven dismantle with 30 degrees of inclination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The photographs show the sequence in which it was possibly disjointed along its way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Information provides elements which seem to indicate that the helicopter can have had impact multiple with the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">After meticulous research in a zone fuller than the encircled place, around the accident, one did not find parts disperse aircraft, which supports the presumption of the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ms protocol announces to find gene of obesity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Social Security directs an investigation to discover gene of obesity in the case of the children and young people\; this is supported by specialists in the IPN</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it directs an investigation to discover gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called Genetic protocol “of the obesity of the children and teenagers” who will allow to have the markers associated with the overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In an official statement, the chief of the Unit of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialities of the National Medical center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that one had trained a multidisciplinary team doctors, nurses, nutritionists and assist social.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team is supported by specialists and post-graduate students of the National institute of Public health (INSP) and Center of Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To the investigation one invites to take part the population being entitled or not, to present itself to the participating sporting units of the IMSS with Valle of Mexico City, where the evidence with the minors all the samedis as from 8:00 hours are carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It stressed that the protocol started in the Sporting Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado of Mexico City Poniente) and that starting from October 8th, the activity is held in the Sporting Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado of Mexico City Oriente).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">After having achieved the goal to join together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sporting Unit Independencia (in the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sporting Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">He explained that the objective of this investigation and that E to know the components and the importance of the genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify at the children and young Mexican risk factors to prevent the appearance of the chronic degenerative diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">As one will celebrate on November 14th the World Day of the Diabetes, it mentioned that the objective is that to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the assent and under the surveillance of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to the food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They will be also asked on their physical-activity and their antecedents of family heredity their diseases, to avoid the risk factors which start affections like the diabetes or the renal insufficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It detailed that the samedis one will apply to all the participants of anthropometric measurings (weight, size, circumference of the size), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (one seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz López announced that this investigation is the fruit of the concern of the health professionals for alarming taken weight in the case of the minors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“The investigations of health of 1999 and 2006 announced that in only six years there was a rise, in the case as of boys, of the 77 percent in obesity and in the case as of girls of the 47 percent\; with regard to the overweight one also observed a dramatic rise”, the specialist in the IMSS underlined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It indicated that the justification for the research of the markers is based in the fact that the population of the country is different from different by its genetic history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It informed that on average, the Mexicans have one 65 percent of indo-American heredity, one 30 percent European and one five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with the diabetes and overweight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He explained why in general, the genetics of obesity is translated in the incapacity to burn the excess of energy which one consumes (calories), who settles in the shape of grease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The researcher explained that the benefit direct for the participants it is the integral evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect if they present a degree of overweight or obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ila even known as that the presence of the folds of color sinks (acanthosis) on the neck and the front armlever indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic deteriorations and even pre-diabetes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, to which one explains each measurements and change in the lifestyle that they must carry out to prevent the diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz López explained that there are three components principal which causes overweight, obesity and other chronic affections: the sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical-activity, to remain most the day sitting in front of the TV and to use means of transport instead of going on foot at short distances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greatest consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pie to the cornstarch wrapped in corn sheets -, bread, pizza pie, hamburgers, etc) with high contents of greases and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid blackcurrants</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researcher of Faculté of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops the asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better output, independently of the environmental conditions and temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If announce them that the paving stone were solved, it would not be necessary any more to repair approximately 200 thousand blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of Mexico City, informs Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of Faculté of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, which ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous paving stone is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">During its conference a technological opinion on blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it announced that the laboratory for which it is responsible develops the asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a larger mechanical resistance, so much with the high ones like low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera estimated that this kind of modified asphalts could be used in places in which the climate is extremely hot, like certain cities of the north of the country, to improve the output, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained why asphalt, the heavier share of oil, is a set of molecule, hydrocarbon molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a molecular weight low, called malthenes, which together give to the paving stone its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, with 120 degrees c its viscosity is very large and to 50 degrees c it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes breakable, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">That means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, informs the specialist in chemical engineering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible paving stone, composed of six layers of materials, whose three last imply asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the surface layers the layer of asphalt is, formed by small stones bathed out of asphalt and compacted later on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each small stone which forms the layer, announced it, is bathed year asphalts.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the vehicles pass there while generating efforts, this one allows that the forces are propagated very well in the paving stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">If there were modified asphalt, those would be propagated better, opinât the chemical ingénier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the layer of asphalt, he says, one puts a last layer called course wearing, made out of fine stone, i.e., sand which is also bathed out of asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">As this one is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the layer of asphalt and provide adherence in the street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Being the part of the paving stone which receives and distributes the efforts, the wearing course also requires that this one have an adequate thickness and the material of which it is made must be neat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The climate, especially moisture and the temperature variations, are also a factor very important to consider, especially water, he says, because those affect considerably the output of the layer of asphalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">When the ground is wet, water is spread inside the layer is it is difficult that this one left, which softened all the layers of the paving stone and consequently causes blackcurrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the lawsuit of formation of a blackcurrant, he says, the first which trowel is the film of bearing and only later on is affected the layer of asphalt, but the damage does not take place immediately, but these is a process which must be neat with the first signals with adequate programs of maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member of the National System of the Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another significant factor for the blackcurrant formation and consequently the thickness of each layer of the paving stone must be always related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent blackcurrant formation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera informed that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to easily repair blackcurrants and without having to use high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">What missed the candidate of Valle to be the new Colombia miss?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analyzes factors which made that Melina Ramírez Serna does not obtain the crown of Colombia miss.</seg>
<seg id="3">Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to gain the crown of Colombia Miss.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact of being on the podium of winner, of carrying the money crown and the band which accredits it like new princess of Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With result obtained yesterday evening with Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is ridden with the crown and the sceptre, the department nap already 14 titles of Princess and Melina to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Gisele Bitchy girls Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Bitchy girls Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Today the great question that many people installation are:</seg>
<seg id="8">What did it miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite that in each presentation showed that it had it very to be the new Colombia Miss, because it had not been elected in vain Reine of the Pretty Police and Meilleur Face of Vogue, of the titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who carried the crown of Colombia Miss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Is the first factor considered key in the decision taken by sworn to indicate it First Princess the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question “? Which was the book which marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of Carreta Literaria Leamos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:</seg>
<seg id="11">“I read much, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser, definitively I believe that the book which marked my childhood is “the small prince”, it is a rather deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now I read “Crime and Punishment”, it is a book of universal literature which should read to us all\; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, Russian, a very beautiful book which is called “the heat of blood "".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This answer does not have first of all likes because of term “culturaliser” and secondly not to explain concretely how each quoted book had marked it.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at the end of the Melina ceremony declared that it felt quiet and happy with the result “the universe and wise, he happens what must occur.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for everyone, read please a little, “the small prince” is a large book”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Between the launched assumptions there is that according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist of Bogota insinuated that being preferred, applauded and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), “that awoke the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore it did not shine on the scene”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And one noted that in his first presentation in bathing suit with the beach of Hilton and his two processions of the crowning day before.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if with the two processions it had appeared sure of it even, it were noted that it did not have the force and the energy of representing of Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program “Como put some” (As at the house), of the RCN Channel declared that the fact that Melina had been indicated princess “confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most price during the contest does not receive the crown of queen”.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was an error.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another assumption it is that Valle did not succeed in convincing the jury on his interest for the social initiatives, which is in fact the petrol of the National competition of Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore two days before the sworn election international Lucy Doughty declared that they sought a woman engaged with regard to the social needs for his country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">“Only the beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond the physique and to center itself on its social sensitivity, why before beginning the Contest already are implied in projects”, she explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">One also speculates that Valle sinned by its defects of sound behind and the fibrosis which was observed in its abdomen, but that is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected it like the candidate “Beauty natural” with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The preparer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there in was better, “but its problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which actually for me had not been too notorious, left points to him the last day”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos review considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were surgical operations which it had undergone.</seg>
<seg id="28">“The surgeries are good, but Valle did not know to do them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Its body was never its asset and it lost because of this aspect”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For this price, that the National competition of Beauty gives for the first time, after the procession in bathing suit has emerges a cruel prediction which was achieved yesterday evening, one said that was a small present that Raymundo made in Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins a year of reign today, not like sovereign, if not princess, a position which gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of National competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will pass in the history like one of the queens who in spite of sound dazzling passage by Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A dactyloscopist of Cali passed to the history as the man who confirmed the death of “Alfonso Cano'.</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these civils servant is crucial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The past November 4th a dactyloscopist of the CTI of Cali passed to the history like the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of Farc: “Alfonso Cano”, by confronting its digital fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven dactyloscopists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of “disponibilité' of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada which has worked for 21 years in the legal field of investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of its career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where much time it had to pass more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place in which corpses qu were to be identified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The year 2000 it was done transferred to the capital from Valle and after having follow adequate courses, it specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and the feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano one had informed in Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Something of very large expected it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Friday the night it left for Cauca in a helicopter Palmira.</seg>
<seg id="11">It knew that it was to identify two corpses and that one suspectait that one of them was that of the man who directed the older guérrilla of the world, consequently one required of him to carry the chart with the ten digital fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (its true name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But when it arrived with the team of investigation towards corpse, it did not recognize it by its physical aspect, because this one was very different from that which he had seen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">It did not have a barb, it was equipped like a peasant with the zone, without glasses and much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the prints do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the digital fingerprints of the corpse with those of the chart.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its eye did not mislead it not: it was about “Alfonso Cano”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This same night, the man originating in Puerto Tejada was the person in charge who confirmed to the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme leader of Farc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In search of the print</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For a dactyloscopist of Sijín de Cali the recognition which president Juan Manuel Santos made in Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against “Cano”, is very significant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people of do not know our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Except for identifying the corpses, the dactyloscopists support the investigations for the offenses like the flight and the homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people.</seg>
<seg id="23">When are captured, much delinquents present false identity cards or do not have documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">We take their digital fingerprints and let us seek them in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The researcher told that in a case of flight it had to remove part of wall of a house, because in this place the robber had supported his hand to make leave a safe full with jewels and money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a digital fingerprint from it, but in this case we could obtain the print of all the hand and to identify with the delinquent who had taken part in various flights”, remembers it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The prints can also draw aside or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recently one found a man died, with drink bottles around him.</seg>
<seg id="29">By interlude of the investigation one determined that a relative can be suspect crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even if that No does not guarantee that he is the assassin, that places it on the scene of the crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A dactyloscopist of the CTI explained that one extracts “the digital fingerprints from the objects with chemical or physical reagents”.</seg>
<seg id="32">When they appear, one uses a sampler or a band to take them.</seg>
<seg id="33">Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the déclinquents, or with the National Civil Register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers”, indicated the expert of the CTI.</seg>
<seg id="35">He explained why all is not how one shows in the CSI television program.</seg>
<seg id="36">As all that shines is not gold, very that one touches does not become forcing a print.</seg>
<seg id="37">It can however be used, if one carries out confrontation necessary.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The GDP raises one 1.5% thanks to consumption domesticates and puts an end to the spiral of fall of the the beginning of March</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Since March the Japanese economy was paralysed, convalescent still after the devastator earthquake who became nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe of the Japanese country since the Second world war.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses to 300,000 dollars million, a blow which, in spite of the difficult world context, seems to be attenuated.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross domestic product between July and September were used for to make a fresh start definitively: the GDP raised one 1.5% compared to the former quarter and one 6% in calculated on a yearly basis rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">That recorded the second quarters - for Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - supposes, moreover, largest puts rhythm into of rise since the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recovery is explained, partially, by the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore the zones devastated by the earthquake and the posterior tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the companies increased their investments per 1.1%, compared to the fall of the 0.9% of the expenditure of capital observed from January to March, the first retreat after six months of not-stopped rise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, truth stimulate Japanese economy is not exclusively based on the impulse Keynesian which invites to benefit from the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow of zero.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan awoke especially thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, which currently accounts for the 60% of the Japanese GDP.</seg>
<seg id="11">This variable raised one 1%, pushed by the rise in the expenditure on vehicles, voyages and activities of entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The mark of the yen</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Tokyo went back to the interior market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the “blue-chip stocks” elected by the investors who flee the crisis of the debt in eurozone and the turbid forecasts of the States Unies, a privilege which weighs like a flagstone in the accounts of the exporting companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">With divided the stronger, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic line of undulation is determined by the health of the great technological groups.</seg>
<seg id="15">Toyota or Sony, for example, made responsible for their weak results between July and September the contribution of the yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.</seg>
<seg id="17">“It is necessary to follow the risks which persist, like the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the fast appreciation of the yen”, announced yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.</seg>

<seg id="9">Thus, Its Majesty explained why the objective is that at the end of 2015 there is 175 million poor families which reached at these financial services and which hundred million these families leaves the poverty line in which they live now.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the congress of the Union Christian Democrat (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, proceeded without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the party Christian Democrat.</seg>
<seg id="3">The future of Europe was not initially envisaged with the program but was essential on the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who judge the policy of the government too much laxist with respect to the Greeks today and perhaps of the Italians tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted with the quasi-unanimity.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 1001 deputy, only nine voted against and ten abstained from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Standing ovation of several minutes to which had right, at the conclusion of their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave place to the doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea-mistress of the chancellor - and motion - holds in a slogan: the answer to the crisis “is not less Europe but more Europe”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe, it is peace but because “nine million employment depends directly on the euro”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For the chancellor, “time came from an opening to Europe”.</seg>
<seg id="10">That could result in modifications with the treaty of Lisbon making it possible to reinforce the control of the European Union on the budget policies of the countries of the euro zone, but that could also lead to the election of the president of the European Commission by the universal suffrage “in order to give a face to Europe”.</seg>
<seg id="11">Such is in any case one of the proposals of motion adopted by the congress whose inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, it is not very probable that the Twenty-seven ones agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is hostile there and the leaders of CDU believe it that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the stake is posed.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the same way, the delegates rejected with one crushing majority the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the directory of the European Central bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted reinforcing the weight of Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Anxious to alleviate the climate inside her party, the chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and with Helmut Kohl But she either did not seek to gain her congress on the back of the “small” European countries or the prompt countries in difficulty of criticizing arrogant Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">If motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of “the Franco-German friendship”, Angela Merkel did not evoke France.</seg>
<seg id="17">Except in hollow.</seg>
<seg id="18">By recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the middle of a bloody battle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, it was one of more humiliating defeats of the Napoleonean army.</seg>

<seg id="1">What represents the fraud with the stops disease?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the allowances, UMP and the government launch the offensive on the stops disease.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a Family Social Benefit Office, and to make a speech on the topic - recurring since 2007 - fight against the social frauds and the assistantship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a will to save money in a context of rigor, but is not heralding an axis the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to concentrate on the stops disease.</seg>
<seg id="5">Initially with an aim of budgetary economies: the government plans to impose to the employees of private fourth day of deficiency before the assumption of responsibility of a sick leave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In light, without specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A measurement which is likely to cause anger, but which would make it possible to bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.</seg>
<seg id="8">And which would be accompanied by another measurement, of range plus symbolic system: to impose to the civils servant one day of deficiency not compensated in the event of sick leave (they do not have up to now a waiting period, against three days in the private one).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Whereas these questions are under discussion, the majority also starts again the set of themes of the frauds, targeting this time the abuses related to the sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Controls will be much more important and, moreover, if you are taken, you will refund”, Xavier Bertrand with the microphone of RTL, Sunday, November 13 informed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As for other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of the frauds to the sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="12">This one indeed been the object since 2002 of a continuous follow-up and political offensives, which generally bore fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Let us delay initially on the national figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the National bank of health insurance (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were delivered in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the Research institute and of documentation in health economics, the daily allowances accounted for in 2008 5% of the health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">On this sum, 46% related to the vacation maternity and occupational accidents, and 54% related to the stops disease, that is to say 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">And thus 2.5% of the health expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French knew on average 14.5 days of sick leave, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting group.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average which hides unquestionable variations: another investigation, published in 2007 by the site of management of Monster.com career, showed that 75% of the 40,000 questioned French employees said not to have taken no day of stop disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study, this time of the Health insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of the stops disease were one duration lower than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days in one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">When one compares them with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more inclined than elsewhere with the sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="23">A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of total absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% to the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud with the stops disease represents very little vis-a-vis the moonlighting.</seg>
<seg id="25">As for the fraud, it reaches only one weak width.</seg>
<seg id="26">Reinforcement of the legislation made since 2002 that controls are systematic on the stops disease of more than 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, on 1.5 million controls, the CNAM noted that 13% of the 285,000 realized for stops of short time were “unjustified or too long”, that is to say 37,050 cases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the case of the stops of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, one counted 11% of cases “unsuited or unjustified” on 1.2 million, is 132,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">On the whole, therefore 169,000 “unjustified” cases, on several million paid having had a stop disease.</seg>
<seg id="30">A figure which represents face well little, for example, with that of the moonlighting.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the deputy UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the question in June, this one would account for 9 to 15 billion euros of tax shortfall a year, that is to say more than the total costs of the daily allowances, and thus infinitely more than the fraud with these last.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">Of outset, the experts quote a recent investigation of Economist Intelligence Links, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of planet.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no proof that this decriminalisation involves abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of the euthanasia or the suicide assisted on nonqualified people or not agreeing.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, affirmed yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, one would precisely find more cases of these overflows in the countries where the euthanasia and the assisted suicide are not legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“The euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal”.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal”, explains Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Canadians favorable to the euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let us recall that 85% of the Canadians already decided in favor of the euthanasia because they believe that it would at the end of the lifetime make it possible to the people to reduce their sufferings, according to a survey Angus Reid carried out in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing the euthanasia will not cause to send the message that the life of the elderly people or handicapped has less of value.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for the people having practiced the assisted suicide, probed estimate at 41% that they should not be continued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">As regards maintenance or suspension of the care near a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">As, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest as it is indicated in the criminal Code that the withdrawal of the care for which there was a refusal legally validates is not criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The committee of experts also asks that the health professionals are trained with the duty to respect a refusal of the care at the end of the lifetime, without fearing criminal continuations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As regards palliative care, the committee claims that the governments, institutions of health care, and the doctors work together to ensure of better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Lastly, as regards palliative or final sedation, already largely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the committee asks that she be considered, when she is not used to reduce to the physical pain, like euthanasia, and that she is prone to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Reserves of other experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Certain experts in the field of the right of health already issued reserves concerning the conclusions of the report of the experts of the royal Company of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Me Pierre Deschamps, specialist in right of health, described as “extreme” the position of the expert signatories of the report, inter alia things because it does not limit the practice of the euthanasia to the patients in final phase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">“That opens the door to a situation where each and everyone which would be tired life and which would have more than 18 years could require so that one help it to commit suicide”, to Me Deschamps says, which had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="31">Me Deschamps also underlines that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values which take part in social fabric of the company.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">However, “in company, he says, there are beacons and constraints”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The specialist in the right of health Margaret Somerville as expressed “a strong opposition” to the conclusions of the report, as it described as “manifesto pro-euthanasia”.</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who is itself member of the Royal Company of Canada, disputes in particular the data of the report as for the absence of abuse in certain countries where the euthanasia and the assisted suicide are legalized, that is to say in the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The future chief of the Italian government, Mario Monti, claimed a little time at the markets to train his team and to implement a program, which will contain “sacrifices”, in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the government Berlusconi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The former European Commissioner was under discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the trade unions and employers.</seg>
<seg id="5">It should set up a relatively restricted cabinet composed technocrats external at the Parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">“Monti spoke about an important program with much of sacrifices”, said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the many parliamentary small groups engaged in the talks, after having met the president of the indicated Council.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has for its part says to expect that Mario Monti requests from here at Friday a vote of confidence at the Parliament to make sure that the new government has a sufficient support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The consultations will end in the presentation by Mr. Monti of a short list, undoubtedly of a dozen ministers, with the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bond-holders yesterday, in their asking for time.</seg>
<seg id="10">In “democracy, there are precise times” to prepare a government and its program, he underlined, thinking “unquestionable that the markets will be patient and understand”.</seg>
<seg id="11">Its designation by the president had been initially greeted by the markets, but concern took again the top in particular after an unexpected fall of the industrial production in euro zone in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Indicated the Prime Minister should constitute a team including technocrats especially, even if it stressed that it would like to include “policies there”.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new government must last until 2013, date of next legislative, he estimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain the confidence of the Parliament by Friday.</seg>

<seg id="17">The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of balance in the budget in 2013 in spite of the adopted plans of austerity these last months, in particular asked for new measurements of rigor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The “owner of the Italian owners” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it Tuesday, also insisted on the need for starting again the economy, “because a country which does not have growth cannot respect the parameters of deficit”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Mr. Monti, famous for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a “change of time” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, the “professor” symbolizing “the challenge of serious” and “other Italy”, according to the leader-writers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The big unknown will be the longevity of its team.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the center to establish a company producing of “nano-diamonds” in Kiev.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In his last report, the IAEA evokes “strong indications that the development by Iran” of a nuclear system of detonation “was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew well this technique, but which, as a Member State informed the Agency of it, worked during the essence of its career on this technology within the military nuclear program of its country of origin”.</seg>

<seg id="8">Whereas we are 7 billion D " beings human on planet, L " demographic trends will involve by 2050 a doubling of the request D " electricity, unless depriving an enormous part of the world population of a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">In same time, it will be necessary to mitigate the rarefaction of the fossil resources to continue to permanently produce L " electricity, without forgetting the pressing need for reducing the gas emissions for greenhouse effect to fight against the climatic disordered state, a subject disappeared from the ecological debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up the nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is the case neither of Belgium, which subjects his to the need for being able to find a source of replacement able to be substituted, nor of Switzerland, which just intends more not to build but power stations of last generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only them, continue their projects with determination.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States, them, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by taking again the construction of a power station stopped after the accident of Three Mile Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the German model, centered on renewable energies, is sometimes presented like an example, reality opposes the speech.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will result in the increase in the price of L " electricity, an energy dependence worsened by the recourse increased to imported gas, in particular of Russia, a jump of the CO2 emissions pulled by the construction of power stations to gas and coal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a few months, the whole of these annoying effects are already made feel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark east to be meditated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Champion of Europe of L " wind, of which it draws 30% from its electricity, it is also one of the largest gas and coal users because of intermittency of the wind\; under the terms of what, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">Contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors discharge an invoice D " electricity higher of 40% than that of the French households.</seg>
<seg id="21">Whereas in a globalized economy the cost of L " energy constitutes a key factor of competitiveness and a pledge of the maintenance of the industrial tools on the national territory, the French companies profit from L " the least expensive electricity of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">So any significant reduction on behalf of the nuclear power would generate a big rise of the price of L " electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of the purchasing power.</seg>
<seg id="23">A price that a vast majority of French refuse to pay, the more so as they do not express opposition of principle to this energy, the surveys show it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let us recall that the energy policy of our country made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct uses and 410,000 induced employment.</seg>
<seg id="25">Strongly exporting, it involves a galaxy of SME specialized on the international markets and very creative of employment not délocalisables makes them.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France had suddenly decided to leave the nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice a good amount of these SME by reducing like shagreen the 6 billion annual euros of French exports D " equipment and services nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Which electrician would order a EPR conceived to function sixty years whereas the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?</seg>
<seg id="28">To solve L " energy equation, it should be admitted that there does not exist source of production D " electricity miracle, not more than there does not exist about it of diabolic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The development by Areva of not very transmitting, nuclear and renewable CO2 solutions, testifies to the complementarity of the sources D " energy.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the nuclear power, to maintain more the high level of safety is an absolute requirement.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have in France an Authority of safety which exerts an intransigent and transparent control on the existing power stations as on the building site of Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited same obsession of safety.</seg>
<seg id="33">In one half-century, nuclear industry knew three serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under conditions of normal operating\; it remained without human consequence nor environmental.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Tchernobyl, the design of the engine and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of a width without precedent which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as it had done for the two precedents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Fruit of this approach and a co-operation between the authorities of safety, the owners and the manufacturers French and German, the EPR presents a design making it able to resist such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">Whereas he is considered by all the electricians eager to build a power station, the stop of its construction with Flamanville would be a splendid gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF in their leaving the free track to seize the leadership in the impossible to circumvent development of the nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave L " emotion, the dogmas and the operations well-wishers to also dominate a debate determining for the economic situation, social and financial of our country.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Is immigration a load or a chance for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The policy as regards immigration carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized under various angles - clogging of the police, legal and administrative services subjected to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the autoproclamé statute of “country of the human rights” of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, it is the administrative harassing whose the object the foreign students make who made the topicality, the Home Secretary (to read Libération of May 23rd) proclaiming on the way that France “does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters of restaurant”.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it only is seldom analyzed under the economic angle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is that there is on this subject a rather broad consensus between left and right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that “900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country including nearly 2 million immigrant workers”, and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France “cannot accommodate all the misery of the world in 1990”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference, the degree of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left like on the right.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the two edges, the immigrants are perceived like a load for the economy and the French company.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference holds with the degree of generosity that one will condescend to grant with respect to the immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">In his program, François Hollande confines himself with banalities, indicating that codéveloppement will allow to solve our “migratory problem”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration like a load, a problem, is perhaps paying electorally\; but it is economically very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">As point out it the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Future Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our, May 2011, Princeton University Close, 352 pp.), there exists a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact in the migratory flux on the economic growth, the wages and employment in the countries which receive immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="14">To restrict immigration weakens the growth and harms employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Fears with respect to the impact of the migrants are founded on the idea that those are likely to replace the national workers, particularly the qualified little, putting pressure downwards on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the experiment shows that, actually, the immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes to the national employees, exerting essentially trades in sectors in shortage of employment.</seg>
<seg id="17">The little qualified immigrants work in sectors which do not attract the national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the formation does not follow the job offer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A positive effect on the wages</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country which knows a shortage of anesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and the use of the nationals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a rise of 1% of the migratory flux involves an increase ranging between 0.6 and 0.9% of the real wages in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="21">And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among the Nobel Prize American\; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were rested by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants are also net contributors of the social systems, on average to a total value of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Worldwide organization of work estimates for example that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the 30 years age will make a clear contribution (receipts minus expenditure) of 150000 euros to the public budgets on average on the whole of his life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wished, at the beginning of mandate, outward journey to seek the missing points of growth “with the teeth”.</seg>
<seg id="25">The teeth in question, while being used to dissuade the immigrants, had the exact adverse effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe invented the democracy, remains to think the European democracy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The democracy is an invaluable good\; it is also a fragile good.</seg>
<seg id="3">The continent of Europe should be able to remember it him who, to have invented it in Athens there is more than two thousand years, knew along 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some could believe that it would be enough, so that the democracy triumphed definitively over its enemies, to exert the vote, and to exert it in the most direct way which is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One knows, since Napoleon “the Small one”, that it was a facility of thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">The universal suffrage, to be the requirement of the democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can be even made “instrument of oppression” as said formerly the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.</seg>
<seg id="7">Not, the democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, solidarity economic and social, a justice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The crisis of Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is as much and initially a crisis of the policy and democracy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The palinode of the truth-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect value of revealing double: that of the need for a powerful return of the policy, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its incongruity.</seg>
<seg id="10">This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="11">The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic combat moved today, and that, for much of them, the republican soldiers do not draw any more in the right direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We do not have anything to gain to require a succession of national referendums, organized with the liking of the needs and in dispersed order.</seg>
<seg id="13">A full power with the European absolute monarch or a jump with feet together in the vacuum of the nationalist fold: what a choice for the citizen!</seg>
<seg id="14">Not, we do not want choppers but a exercise, commun run, automatically, serene and continuous, a choice and a democracy, this time at the European level.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - one would not know besides any more where to stop L " enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is very whole Europe which yields with the diktats of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its defect of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is very whole Europe which is humiliated on the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="18">One worries about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - but it is very whole Europe which loses its sovereignty gently, and with it each one of its nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The urgency, it is to give again with popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.</seg>
<seg id="20">Because it is together, which Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, to release themselves from the markets and to prepare the future while investing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The way out of crisis will suppose decisions at the European level which could not be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, except of course leading us to the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">After having a long time fought this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone claims the European economic government today.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is to say.</seg>
<seg id="24">But to think it without a political integration and democratic stronger, and lived like such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We must assume a new stage of European construction.</seg>
<seg id="26">To make the Republic in France, republicans should “have been made”.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Revolution in the interests could not be enough there.</seg>
<seg id="28">This lesson remains valid.</seg>
<seg id="29">We must build Europe more integrated on the economic plan.</seg>
<seg id="30">That could be done only by building more democratic Europe on the political plan, a true European popular sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="31">To make Europe, let us make Europeans.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The world show of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, close to Paris, in an optimistic climate.</seg>
<seg id="3">The year 2011 should be indeed completed on a rise of 11% of the world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, telephone with SIM card…), with more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart cabinet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The most carrying segment is that of technology without contact which makes it possible to pay public transport or to pay its purchases by simply approaching the chart of a reader.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold throughout the world, against 320 million one year earlier!</seg>
<seg id="6">Their share should still progress in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market of the smart card (6.925 million charts).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A long time with the drag of the Asia-Pacific area, Europe gains ground for the payment without contact.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some 26 million Visa bank cards is already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 terminals of payment accept it.</seg>
<seg id="9">In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 charts without Visa contact were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="10">But large surfaces put the twice the work.</seg>
<seg id="11">Crossroads thus emitted this year 2.5 million charts Pass MasterCard without contact.</seg>
<seg id="12">To pass at high speed, it is necessary from now on that the banks equip their customers.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Two great French establishments began to diffuse in the future systematically with their customers of the bank cards equipped for without contact”, announces Gerard Nébouy, chief executive officer Visa Europe France.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The banks test the payment by mobile</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But it is only one first stage towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Few apparatuses are equipped today with technology NFC (Near Field Communication) essential to carry out transactions.</seg>
<seg id="17">“They were delayed”.</seg>
<seg id="18">“But they should finally make true great strides the next year”.</seg>
<seg id="19">“We count on the sale from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world”, explains Marc Bertin, president d' Eurosmart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">But the banks take the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Agricultural credit announced yesterday the launching of a test from December to June next in Caen.</seg>
<seg id="22">IPhone of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case authorizing the payment without contact.</seg>
<seg id="23">The BPCE has a plan similar to Strasbourg and Marseilles.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the General society also said yesterday to prepare the marketing of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Suspected of long time, the bonds between terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the sect Nigerian Boko Haram are confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sunday, the Algerian vice-minister of the Foreign affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even marked that Algiers from now on “became convinced of it”.</seg>
<seg id="5">“The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is co-operation well”, he explained without more precision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Paris seems to make a similar analysis.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation into the abduction of two French in Niger last January would have put at the day of the footbridges.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by close relations of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory as several their kidnappers at the time of an operation launched by the French special forces were to be killed the following day at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the debris of the intervention, the French investigators and natives of Niger were to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Center terrorist</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The analysis of the last calls directs towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers interest the investigators particularly: one leads to a Native of Niger who remained lengthily in Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other with a man who says himself near to Aqmi and the sect.</seg>
<seg id="13">“It is a projection but it is undoubtedly necessary to expect more formal evidence before speaking about operational co-operation between Aqmi and Boko Haram”.</seg>
<seg id="14">“But it is possible”.</seg>
<seg id="15">“One knows years since that the sect profits from supports financial and intellectual external and that it is shown more and more activates”, moderates Kunle Amuwo, an enquiring Nigerian.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These last months these “supports” had been increasingly obvious in the evolution and of the speeches of Boko Haram or in its procedures, which imply from now on the recourse to kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and of the same invoice than those used by Aqmi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The international community, starting with Washington, consequently put pressure on Abuja so that he takes into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Nigerian authorities indeed a long time regarded the group as a community of enlightened not very worthy of interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A fast success</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, of a school and iman fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa “Western education is a sin” - preaches the introduction of an Islamic emirate in the Moslem north of Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this poor area, association has fast success.</seg>
<seg id="22">It politicizes and requires a strict respect of the charia while its militants engage the fight against the impious central government.</seg>
<seg id="23">The latter aim initially the churches, the bars, the administrations.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram show themselves particularly active, multiplying the attacks against the police stations.</seg>
<seg id="25">Reaction of Abuja east, as with its practice, without nuances.</seg>
<seg id="26">The army invests the city, one counts 800 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mohammed Yusuf, alive decree, are killed in prison.</seg>
<seg id="28">Consequently the sect will radicalize and leave its strongholds of north.</seg>
<seg id="29">In last Christmas, she claims the responsibility for attack which causes 80 deaths with Jos, then another in Abuja.</seg>
<seg id="30">In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram is caught some at the secure HQ of the police at the time of an attack commits suicide, its first.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August, the local headquarter of the United Nations will be its first international target.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which would surf of Mauritania in Somalia via Nigeria worries from now on all the specialists in safety.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whereas Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, that the Al-Chebab Somali operate in Kenya, Boko Haram seems a new threat in the middle of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last week, during a maintenance in Nigeria with president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and was ready “to share all the information”.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Can America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?</seg>
<seg id="4">To listen to the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.</seg>
<seg id="5">For a few days, Mitt Romney, Hermann Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied the thundering declarations and the short cuts as regards foreign politics, traditionally a republican strong point.</seg>
<seg id="6">On China, on Iran, the assistance to Israel, the slogans - often not backed up - fuse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mitt Romney, best placed in the race with the nomination of “Large Old Party”, threatened to trail the Chinese in front of WTO and to blame them “for handling of their currency”, a topic carrying in America exasperated by the migration whole pieces of its industry towards Asia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Such an amount of worse if that must imply the release of a commercial war, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jon Huntsman, ex-ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign politics, failed to strangle themselves vis-a-vis an attitude which “flatters” the emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">It called with a muscular but constructive dialog with Beijing (the current location of Obama).</seg>
<seg id="11">But Huntsman, which stagnates in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">With the image of Reagan</seg>
</p>

<seg id="13">Romney also promised military strikings on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="14">“If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he boasted.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”</seg>
<seg id="16">He also promised to increase the military aid in Israel, showing Obama to fail in his obligations with respect to this partner.</seg>

<seg id="17">The entrepreneur Hermann Cain, second candidate best placed, poster as for him an embarrassing ignorance of the files.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, it invited to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing “tries to develop a nuclear capacity” - apparently being unaware of owing to the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964!</seg>
<seg id="19">The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikings against Iran, is ready, as for him, to engage the American army in Mexico against the cartels of drug.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recourse to torture against the alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama is recommended in 2009, also by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.</seg>
<seg id="21">One is far from the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign politics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The adversaries of the current president retort that Reagan also had simple ideas and that it gained the cold war.</seg>
<seg id="23">They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that it had to put water in his wine as regards antiterrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">They insist with reason on the failure of its naive dialog with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the “servant boys” of Iraq, on its tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking a label of weak to him.</seg>

<seg id="26">The population considers rather positive the assessment of national security of Obama, who eliminated Bin Laden.</seg>

<seg id="1">North Stream, news carries ntrée of Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Northern gas pipeline Stream, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia while passing at the Baltic sea-bed, entered in service.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million hearths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with glare.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 guests whose four heads of state and government took part, last Tuesday, on the edges of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine dresser, with the unveiling of North Stream, this new gas pipeline who connects directly, under the sea, Russia in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symbolically, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, French the Prime Minister Francois Fillon and her counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve ordering the entry of Russian gas in the Western-European network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases will arrive each year to Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km linking the region of Saint-Pétersbourg to the Land of Mecklembourg-Poméranie.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, making it possible to on the whole deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas, that is to say the equivalent of all French consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one evokes already the possibility of building a third of it on the same course.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, completion in time and hour of this enormous building site has airs of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project had been strongly disputed by Poland and the Baltic States.</seg>
<seg id="12">Stream North indeed will make it possible to deliver gas directly in Germany, by avoiding any terrestrial passage by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, these two countries lose a little their power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to weigh on Russia while threatening to close the access to the Western-European markets to him.</seg>
<seg id="14">With most extremely of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare Stream North with a “new pact germano-Soviet”, in reference to alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is to say if the subject is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe, while supporting this Russian project, gained there a greater safety of its supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project created a breach between Européens of the East and the West.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia knew, in five years hardly, to make triumph its vision over a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly consuming gas, and whose layers are declining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which binds us in an organic way”, Francois Fillon confirmed by inaugurating this gas pipeline, showing at which point the great gas contracts are as political as economic.</seg>
<seg id="20">All that explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present of number with Lubmin, the point of gas connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical exploit.</seg>
<seg id="22">The underwater tube is out of concrete steel sheathed in order to protect it from the anchors from the ships.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the sea-bed, to 200 m on average.</seg>
<seg id="24">To build it, minefields should have been avoided dating from the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="25">“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by precaution”, indicates Jens Müller, spokesperson of the Northern company Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was also necessary to multiply measurements to protect fauna and the flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing stops over all its length: neither valve, nor station of maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="28">A platform of control was envisaged off Sweden, but the persons in charge of the project gave up it whereas the Swedes were not very eager to see a Russian company of State being established in a permanent way at broad their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">“In the event of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than one minute”, Jens Müller specifies.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the event of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline thus escapes in the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this case is considered to be not very probable by the manufacturers who envisaged the weldings to know an escape every 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The monitoring of the state of the gas pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, trailed by a ship, for the external observation, as by an apparatus which circulates inside the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">The shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, broad one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by gas.</seg>
<seg id="34">On arrival, after three days complete of voyage at the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers accurate information on the possible deformations of metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The gas pipeline was designed to function fifty years without having to undergo least repair.</seg>
<seg id="36">The circulation of gas is simply ensured by the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is of 200 bars at the beginning, and 100 on arrival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies linked their forces to carry out this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">United there German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each one), as well as Dutch the French Gasunie and group GDF Suez (9% each one).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies created a joint undertaking, named Northern Stream, asked to build and operate the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has its seat with Zoug, in Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favorable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom then rented at this company, for twenty years renewable, the totality of the transport capacities of gas.</seg>
<seg id="44">“Gazprom will pay for full capacity, whatever the quantity of gas really transported”, Jens Müller specifies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was ensured 30% by the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total costs of work should reach the 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, the investment was assembled to 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are sure to return in their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic with Lubmin, on a planted sandy littoral of pines.</seg>
<seg id="50">Valves, high, 4.5 meters form the exit door of gas.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure the pressure, the temperature and specificities of the gas which arrives, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas at each hour which passes.</seg>
<seg id="53">With full capacity, they will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moleskin, a notebook of mark.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskin wants to give again the taste of the writing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It has a perfume of adventures, hours spent to write in the light of a candle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band, its sheets of a color broken white, as aged by time.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the Moleskine notebook such as it today is known was born… in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at the time launching a report distinguished design but.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maria Sebregondi, then consulting for the company, undertakes the launching of the new product.</seg>
<seg id="8">The notebook takes as a starting point an old production technique, the mole skin (skin of mole) which indicates a cotton varnished used to cover benches for example.</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of notebook was very snuffed writers and travellers.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Moleskin gave to the last style an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the artists avant-gardists, to the XX E century”, Maria Sebregondi tells, become since the person in charge of the mark at Modo Modo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Success is there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26% to be established to 12.7 million past parts.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moleskin exceeds the Italian borders and is exported in 70 countries, of France to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">Difficult to establish an identikit picture of the purchaser, because the report allures as well the businessman as the student and the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="16">With the image of Moleskin, its consumers cosmopolitan, open of spirit and are cultivated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The Italian small company, which counted 12 employees at its beginnings, in account almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices\; one in Milan and the other in New York.</seg>
<seg id="18">It distributes its notebooks in the bookstores, of Fnac to the small shops of downtown area and knew to impose its identity.</seg>
<seg id="19">“We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, in spite of the rise of e-mail”, explains Maria Sebregondi.</seg>
<seg id="20">This cultural signature accompanies the development by Moleskin: recently, the mark launched an exposure “Turning” where architects or artists expose their own notebook.</seg>
<seg id="21">In August, it also launched a cover in leopard, at the time of the Festival of film of Locarno.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Benefitting from its success and from this will have cultural, Moleskine knew to diversify its products: bags, diary, pens, covers of computer… The mark is declined on a whole range of supports.</seg>
<seg id="23">A success which made the envious ones: with the autumn 2006, Modo Modo was repurchased by investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the unemployment rate of the handicapped workers remain does so high?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Approximately 19% of the handicapped people are in search of a work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 15th week for the employment of the handicapped people opens today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In spite of a voluntarist public policy installation in 2005, the unemployment rate of the handicapped people is still twice higher than the average: 19%, against 9% for the whole of the population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Discouraging?</seg>
<seg id="6">“Not, underlines Eric Blanchet, chief executive officer of Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of the handicapped people. ”</seg>
<seg id="7">“Good progresses for fifteen years have been considerable. ”</seg>
<seg id="8">“At the time, unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. ”</seg>
<seg id="9">“It still enormously remains nevertheless to make. ”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It should be said that for the handicapped unemployed, the obstacles remain numerous before reaching employment.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are rather old: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a qualification level relatively low: 80% do not have the vat and on the 2.3 million students of higher education, 10,000 only are handicapped.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the handicapped people, against 38% on average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, as many criteria which complicate the return to employment singularly, and which “constitute the node of the problem”, according to Christian Grapin, chief executive officer of Springboard, an association created to help the companies in 1992 to recruit handicapped workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Here are for the objective brakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Remain the unvoiced comment, mentalities which evolve, certainly, but too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study carried out in April by association IMS-To undertake for the City indicated that the questioned managers have “a low level of knowledge of the handicap”, with a “over-representation of the people in wheelchair, defective psychic the or intellectual ones”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Result, the private companies of more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of use of 6% of handicapped workers, fixed in a law of… 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last known figures, which go back to 2008, mention a ratio of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">“We are now around 3%”, indicates Pierre Blanc, chief executive officer of Agefiph, the organism in charge to collect the contributions of the companies which do not comply with this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof: the number of “taxed” establishments, just like the paid amounts, fell between 2007 and 2011, passing 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">“The law of 2005, which increased the contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, explains Pierre Blanc. ”</seg>
<seg id="23">“But this improvement translates also a true awakening, in particular in the great groups. ”</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the ministry for employment, only 59% of the establishments from 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, against 82% of the companies from 100 to 199 employees.</seg>

<seg id="8">As for the contrastre between its services in club and selection, “it is a whole, it was justified.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“In Lille, I am all the year there, which is not the case with Belgium.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“It is necessary that I take my marks.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Very trustful Portugal</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Portugal de Paulo Bento starts with much optimist his stopping return vis-a-vis Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="3">With the outward journey, the two teams had missed realism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country”.</seg>
<seg id="5">Paulo Bento sees itself there already, in Poland and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">For him, there is not the shade of a doubt, Selecçao, of which it is with the levers since September 2010, will be qualified for the Euro 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">Portugal is indeed only at 90 minutes of happiness.</seg>
<seg id="8">But there are a match to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to unbolt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Within sight of the match outward journey (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears obvious that the games are not played.</seg>
<seg id="10">Portugal dominated the part during more than one hour, certainly, but it was unable to mark this so invaluable goal, which would have relieved it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">“It is a good performance, which involves however a certain risk because we did not mark of goal outside”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But on their premises, in their luminous Stage of Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public which should be there too ebullient, even if the part obviously announce themselves “very tight”, dixit optimistic but lucid Bento.</seg>
<seg id="13">“We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced to be able to get the upper hand”, the trainer Portuguese 42 years declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">“We continue to have 50% of chances to be with the Euro 2012”, nevertheless the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">No one paid Friday of Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and gain.</seg>
<seg id="16">No one can be enough in Bosniens, which needs also to mark.</seg>
<seg id="17">“It is a good performance, which involves however a certain risk because we did not mark of goal outside”, Bento regrets.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We will play against a team which has many technical qualities and which lays out players with many individual qualities”, he added.</seg>
<seg id="19">As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put of entry a maximum of pressure on Bosniens in order to “not give them time to reflect. ”</seg>
<seg id="20">A good idea, on condition that being realistic, this time.</seg>
