<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to block Obama's re-election </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Republican leaders justified its policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that the electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die as a result of the fall of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, the Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="6">In that sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8">And in the same vein a majority of the American government enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that impede the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has been extended after the elections in November 2010, which saw the rise of 2922 new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, during the year 2011 were introduced 180 bills that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require that voters present an identity card with a photograph, as well as a test of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, these laws reduce the periods of early-voting, invalidate the right to register as voters on the day of the ballot and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with previous criminal record. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, no American state demanded that voters provide a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="14">The state of Indiana was the first to demand it. </seg>
<seg id="15">The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16">As a result, Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17">In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card. </seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of the American people, that is, 21 million people of voting age from, do not have any photograph-bearing identity card issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 do not have an identity card with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21">But, often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years do not have a photo ID. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And there is still more. </seg>
<seg id="25">In many states students, voters who vote more to Democratic candidates, may not use the photograph-bearing identity card issued by his institution. </seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, these states allow members of the fishing or hunting clubs that tend to vote for the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state to present this requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30">These measures seek, clearly, limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31">It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws abolishing the registration of voters on the same day of the ballot in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service of aid to voters who wanted to register. </seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35">For example, in the 2004 general election, the campaigns of registration of voters contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of registration of new voters would fall in 2010 compared with the year 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states adopted laws that favored reducing the period of vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while mandate--holders' accounted for only 13% of the voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39">In the case of Hispanics was exactly the same. </seg>
<seg id="40">They represent no more than 11% of the voters, which amounts to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41">However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, the law-maker Democrats and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43">In this sense, the akims Democrats have blocked several bills. </seg>
<seg id="44">The Public Prosecutor's Office of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45">It was, in part, limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47">However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics Democrats denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that the aim is to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49">A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to achieve the presidency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes to electoral system scale will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51">One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="52">In this regard, the measures would undermine the American democratic system. </seg>

<seg id="1">Detection of prostate cancer: the Hacerse test or not let? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the PSA test is, at times, misleading results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it was decided to carry out unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="3">It is more than a sufficient reason for wavering men, already reluctant by itself, on whether or not the screening tests should be made. </seg>
<seg id="4">Take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="5">We have sought advice from two specialists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The studies conducted in the United States was detected a high rate of infection among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="7">For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality among patients who had made the detection and those who do not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of suffering metastases if the screening test has not been made. </seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend the test after 50 years, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="10">African American men have a higher rate of risk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are lax. </seg>
<seg id="13">It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. He should offer all possible options and not necessarily treat the prostate cancers that do not violate the long-term life, in which case it should rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men detected a cancer are not treated, because the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease, and if it progresses, we offer a treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We find are increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or may not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="17">I recommend that the test be done in any case. </seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be the test or not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urología, a tool that allows assessing the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="20">This document can be downloaded (at the moment only in English, but localisations will be offered shortly) at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Preventing the disease </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy choices remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one to smoke, the rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Society Against Cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Instead, we assessed that around 10% of cancers are inherited. </seg>
<seg id="27">Many others remain totally inexplicable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="29">Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Doing enormous damage to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="32">"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="33">A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weightiness </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="40">In large quantities, they climb the risk of suffering a colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="41">The deli products must also be avoided. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of the meat for its screen-printed, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="43">"Can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," we explained. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between the complex vitamin and cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="47">Segú SCC, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another, rather, what is observed was an increase. </seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not been able to determine clearly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and the background of family each with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="51">"Do the screening test does not cause cancer." </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs bosón in detail </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs bosón generated a great shock last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="3">Indeed, it is believed that this bosón is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more, nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="4">And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter, which has not yet been empirically observed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physical is not entirely clear that it is Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="6">We know without doubt that there is a new particle, which closely resembles the Higgs bosón predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data revealed this week in a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still no more data to be sure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem to be few. We will see what it is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this great world, there is a widespread and uncompromisable law, which means that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="10">There is no way to violate this rule and don't try too much, because it will end up doing damage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although the particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is a law here of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" which consists basically of some of its features. </seg>
<seg id="12">Physicists ranked Partcles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand we find good citizens called fermiones, which wisely obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="14">And on the other are bosones, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not by this principle, which means that can be found in the same place and at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which is extraordinary, incidentally, the bosones are divided into two groups: the counters, which we will not discuss here, and the "particles of force," for which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs bosón would be somehow related. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosones, one might stress, are not the exotic bugs that we could believe. </seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you manage to read this story, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bosón: the fotón or the "light particle" acting as "messenger" of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or change direction, "mess up" the electromagnetic field in this precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="19">In this "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a fotón; that is, one of the bosones "bearers of force." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Wujiabao stabler </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">So is the Higgs bosón, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "messy" to make this bosón appear. </seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it needed to reach extremely high energy, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide into the surface. </seg>
<seg id="23">This requires a huge particle accelerator as CERN (the great Hadron Collider is a ring of 27km circumference!) to achieve these levels of energy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all particles or all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like the magnets, they do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, never will be maintained by itself glued to the door of a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="27">And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the rest (how fotón, by the way), are not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But what "can bring" all these investigations?, asked Mrs Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="29">For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and, moreover, allows escrutinen physical differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.. </seg>
<seg id="30">For their part, many fervently want to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that filled some holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="31">This, it must be said, still has huge gaps, such as proposed no explanation concerning the seriousness (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the Universo (another ups!). </seg>
<seg id="32">But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Fallouts </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of these investigations in our day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that wrong to say that will not have any. </seg>
<seg id="35">To see: beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories suspected not at all the revolution that their work would provoke. </seg>
<seg id="36">Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, as he said the physical Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which produced the first continuo laser (the first were pulsados) in 1962, at the outset the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus." </seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a light imager in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics. </seg>
<seg id="41">Despite the fact that it was not at all its original intent, this imager now serves as "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know... </seg>

<seg id="1">Care palliative. The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In his Morir Commission in Dignidad, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be adopted soon pending a bill. </seg>
<seg id="4">However, within this essential domain, there is still much to do. </seg>
<seg id="5">Devoir has tried to see it close. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a break of two years. </seg>
<seg id="8">"I had five years of life, but I have been through seven," he explained, made a pass, lying on his bed in the middle of palliative care Victor-Gadbois Beloeil, which came the previous day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this," continues. </seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has raged: a huge weakness that prevents it from only go to the bathroom and even eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting in front of an inviting lunch, accepts resigned to help him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="12">Brave, even to smile, to talk to the strangers who expended care, I bring drugs and offer a bath. </seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the infra-constitutional death. </seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is that I heal diarrhea, it is humiliating," confesseth. </seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team found a solution to this evil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes pis foot," tells Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center. </seg>
<seg id="17">Returning to his childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That depends on the ability of the person to accept this regression," he noted. </seg>
<seg id="19">Because, in the opinion of the majority of the people who work in care palliative, the great moments occur in the heart of this regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">All patients who enter the heart of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="21">They have a forecast of life maximum of three months. </seg>
<seg id="22">In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer the care "healing." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The biggest fear of Ms. Uba, 89-year-old, is dying "conscious and drowned." </seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has led him to discover their children. </seg>
<seg id="25">"I have some good children," he added. </seg>
<seg id="26">"I no longer are wishes in this life," he says, before accepting that he put a mask to help it breathe. </seg>
<seg id="27">And, in the next few days, expects a last visit of his son who lives in Italy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and food aid. </seg>
<seg id="29">They are care palliative being given when nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="30">To help that his death is more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec we have a care palliative bed for every 11.7 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, because we know that we will all die one day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center. </seg>
<seg id="34">Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The dying offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand. </seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="37">The death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="38">Last night we offer a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, his son completed the beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="40">"We help both patients and their loved ones," tells Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the middle Victor-Gadbois the day pass without being never equal. </seg>
<seg id="42">On the side of a man of 94 years sipping his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed among their pillows while all drink to their health, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, having tried everything to survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For six months, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years with cancer," worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients who are admitted to the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his home and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to care palliative </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to the care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient reaches the final stages of his life, either in his home, in the hospital or in a care centre. </seg>
<seg id="47">And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois centre and the society of care palliative house-call Grand Montréal, almost exclusively specialize in the care of patients with cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is precisely that great qualifying in the Quebec health care so that many doctors in specialized care palliative fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="49">Since the month of October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe is to show their opposition to this initiative. </seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficiently competent to ensure that anyone has the right to care for palliative quality before they are accepted to proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Recently," he explained, " I have seen a patient spend 14 days in emergency suffering great pain without has done enough to alleviate it. </seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care." </seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists stubbornly with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions. </seg>
<seg id="54">The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already low when he left a tiring chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="55">"When I told my oncóloga that he wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that he was very sorry that I would like to fight," he explained. </seg>
<seg id="56">"However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no all-powerful care </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking death thanked their caregivers who are not met in their demands once they eased their pain thanks to a team of palliative care. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, director of the care palliative home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatment against pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Wide-ranging untransferable scandals in Quebec </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Officials of the road network, the BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers of political parties and Italian mafia specialists, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system," which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters. </seg>
<seg id="3">A "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is curious how the system is pulverises once we have hunted the big media," ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police. </seg>
<seg id="5">He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into the embezzlement linked to contracts for roads in Quebec, the liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented to no more than delay. </seg>
<seg id="6">The "report Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of his instincts to stay with a share. </seg>
<seg id="8">The Commission Charbonneau "has already caused two mayors," he added, while waiting to be able to come to "demonstrate the existing tricks behind the individuals." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011 </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies with his team of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government. </seg>
<seg id="11">This unit alsofunctions of the police "Marteau squadron," which, since 2009, have made the "sewages cartel" Montreal should moderate at the time of inflating contracts. </seg>
<seg id="12">These last few weeks, the unit has proceeded to the record number of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal positions as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="14">It is suspected that he has pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="15">It has indicted engineers of the road network in Montreal and enterprisers of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter has caused shock to explain to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="17">He paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="18">M. Zambito distributed money to all-out during the years 2000, giving more than 88000 Canadian dollars (about 68000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power. </seg>
<seg id="19">Similarly, admitted having organized a collection of illegal funds for the liberal ex-viceprimera minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Inflation in the cost of contracts of sewages </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively. </seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, prefectly explained to the committee: in ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose inflated costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in respect of false extras. </seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turn a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="25">In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and Montreal led to a huge crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected political whos that sounded the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="27">As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, was opposed from 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired by 5 million dollars and resold by 1.6 million to Motivators in the housing boom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of the money of election campaigns was dirty money </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The research that eventually will be carried out, it ensures that strip "of a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits." </seg>
<seg id="30">He added that the process is "painful, but positive." </seg>
<seg id="31">We are cleaning the wounds, but we need to do a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant to dubious practices are not repeated. </seg>
<seg id="32">How to make cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned about the role of the "elected politicians aware of the ploy." </seg>
<seg id="35">Believing in a 70% share of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, ironiza: "I have said that this is nothing more than a watered-down version of reality." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit 100$ donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, he said, "while the election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics." </seg>
<seg id="37">It advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot be lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, we will rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who are laughing all to take a look in the mirror. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The PSG is not FCBarcelona!" </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="3">How can I explain it? </seg>
<seg id="4">It could be explained by an individual Awareness-building, but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="5">They have come big players. </seg>
<seg id="6">I advance day by day at his side. </seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has also brought me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="8">And spoilers' I push daily to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="9">In a match, this is easier. </seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is going very fast in football. </seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not acaloro. </seg>
<seg id="12">From my beginning in the center of Clairefontaine INF pre-training to my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It will benefit from the competition drafted by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="14">The re-recruited this summer are used to play games of a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="15">They know that each training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="16">That makes a player like me keen to fight and give it all. </seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a great deal in terms of my position. </seg>
<seg id="18">It is backed by deputies as Claude Makelele, playing in the same position as me. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the man who needed the team? </seg>
<seg id="20">Of course. </seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technical. </seg>
<seg id="22">Today, there is no one equal in the League 1 and is among the best European coaches. </seg>
<seg id="23">It has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="24">He has worked with big players. </seg>
<seg id="25">I believe that other titles will be in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="26">In January I had a very comforting conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="27">I had just emerged from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that is in me also explains my good performance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What does he think about the PSG in the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="30">In League 1, Lyon has removed the post of leader. </seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="32">One of our biggest goals is the League of champions: we have qualified for the quarter-finals in style. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the goal of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="34">We are going to try to get as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="35">From now, you can spend anything. </seg>
<seg id="36">But we have a lot to say against many and very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="37">To begin, we want to end the first of our league against Porto to qualify for the return of quarter-finals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The PSG can become a major European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="39">It already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="40">To become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="42">At the economic level, the GSP is committed to their means to this project is realized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would be a great failure? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="45">This year we will invest all our efforts to achieve this title of champions. </seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we did not come away. </seg>
<seg id="47">In May we take a disappointment, because we had the best possible conditions to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="48">We had a strong season. </seg>
<seg id="49">Finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points should have been champi... </seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, the Montpellier's, had a better season. </seg>
<seg id="52">This year I think it will be good. </seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe that we have weapons to llevárnoslo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">He believes that the media expect more from the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think of what has been invested in the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="56">We have accepted completely. </seg>
<seg id="57">After we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, who are still with things that criticise is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what awaits more people. </seg>
<seg id="59">We can never win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="60">We are not FCBarcelona! </seg>
<seg id="61">We try to put in place a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built over time. </seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present. </seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, which after two seasons, has failed to qualify for quarter-finals, and they have also invested a lot! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the sums invested, you imaginaríamos with 15-Point advantage in the day. </seg>
<seg id="66">That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="71">Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia." </seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and gets many goals. </seg>
<seg id="73">He has come to prove that he is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="74">And it has shown in all the teams in the past that is a great player, a global star. </seg>
<seg id="75">In the group respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="76">And he also respects the men who are around. </seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="78">That pushes others to increase their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of the world, also allows all progress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How you lived Euro 2012 with the French team? </seg>
<seg id="81">It has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="82">I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup. </seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury deter me from accumulating game time. </seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things and I left strengthed. </seg>
<seg id="85">Today, successful game in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus." </seg>
<seg id="87">We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we now have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What is your vision of Didier Deschamps at the forefront of the first month of the "bleus"? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">It is getting results. </seg>
<seg id="90">They are well situated in the group of brassage for the World. </seg>
<seg id="91">The coach is starn, close to the players and inspires to win. </seg>
<seg id="92">As was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc achieved its goal of classify you for the Eurocup. </seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead to the selection to Brazil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the foundation? </seg>
<seg id="97">That game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="98">Each time for all. </seg>

<seg id="1">Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on the central banks, transactions identified and the burdens of processing between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure protocol change in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Some 2,00,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15000 computers of the network. </seg>
<seg id="6">And nearly a thousand websites accept the bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="7">The price of the bitcoin, after having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning to today about ten dollars (contributions censan on page bitcoincharts.Com). </seg>
<seg id="8">It is not impressive when compared with the global changes in real currency or financial products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) inquired about it in a report on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="10">In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency," "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies." </seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as the "credits," used to move in a vídeojuego, and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes encash). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also developed this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="13">But in any exchange a central authority controls and addresses the changes. </seg>
<seg id="14">With the bitcoin, all the network nodes are both repositories of day-ledger, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does SSC-NET? </seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is actually between two Email addresses in the form of Email. </seg>
<seg id="17">A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a system of double key encryption. </seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes bitcoins contained in the book of public accounts, which is disseminated throughout the network. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Hito key is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="22">This is the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a sort of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding the co-curriculum line. </seg>
<seg id="23">This is a phase of cut down card-index - transformation of a large card-index in a shorter and unique numerical footprint. </seg>
<seg id="24">The computers "get" the new transaction and add a number of before "chop" the whole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="26">Once that number is located, the other nodes easily verify that it is good. </seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of joint other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, to commit fraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network he would only accept as a valid one of the two transactions; the other would be an orphan, as both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that resolves the challenge is 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, the bounty's is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation, therefore, is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the cienmillonésimo, which leaves a wide margin. </seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in computing power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="34">The Web sites that offer services to Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in prototype's. </seg>
<seg id="35">"The judgment used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company in real currency that uses the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also takes into account the potential of blanquo money through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash presents the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="38">The actors in weight as Wikipedias reject payments of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the wordpress platform, accepted. </seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit rum-based, Insitito Weizmann in Israel, discussed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins does not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="41">In November it launched the "giant cuts." </seg>
<seg id="42">"It changed $30,000," Jon Holmquist rejoiceth, who works for Coinabul, which makes them bitcoins gold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, enoughmore believes in the potential of this technology in the network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="44">Its system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but Bitcoin used to validate transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="45">The carrier also manages its identity and, therefore, can remain anonymous. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to put in place in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="47">It is sufficient to provide a direction that a phone can "photograph and recognize," said Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement of review of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="49">"There is a need for time to impose Bitcoin, but in 2013 there could be a change," predicts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">On the other hand, in its report the ECB expected to revalue the various risks, now considered high, if this coin succeeds. </seg>

<seg id="9">They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if their causes join jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="10">-Condoned, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="14">The circumstances have changed since its irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood as a result of the fighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="16">His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security. </seg>
<seg id="17">Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today. </seg>
<seg id="18">The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="19">The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="20">They have become speculators, capturing government land for resale as plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, at the same time benefiting from huge US outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="21">They are discredited; most of them have not fought. </seg>
<seg id="22">People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves. </seg>

<seg id="32">The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already rebuilding provincial militias, fleeing the central power. </seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, it should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States have been transformed into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removing the post of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 constitution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="35">However, his country relies on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before. </seg>
<seg id="36">No industry has restored its services, no reservoir has been fixed and major irrigation systems have been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported, and there is nothing except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="38">The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="39">In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">It spread the rumor that Afghanistan possessed vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="41">And that did not only increase the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them. </seg>

<seg id="1">A constitution after a struggle in Egypt </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi's. </seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole of the whole. </seg>
<seg id="4">He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text on the following day. </seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week, the head of state had given two more months to the Assembly to finish its work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And for nearly two years that Egypt uses a provisional text, repeatedly amended, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has not done more to increase the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="8">For their opponents, the president endureth in his "autocratic merrymaking" and is "betraying its word" and "trampling on the right." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">By its supporters, it ensures that it is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="10">In the next 15 days should be a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time that requires the Brothers to give up its project to explain the text, article-by-article--the to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaking havoc across the country. </seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi's seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in their favor, as stated in an interview with the American weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that this appeal has been voted rapidly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or vote my text or maintain the full powers," powers that supposedly will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islam-based overwhelmingly voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the liberals did not go to the call. </seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they believed that they could not assert their views. </seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same. </seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve the quorum, yesterday in the morning was added to 11 people, Replacer members, in a hurry. </seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="21">Expectedly, articles voted have been unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators makes them gráce, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few differences of the day there is almost at the time of the sentence, so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday was still being voted, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2, the subject of all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law." </seg>
<seg id="25">Salafis parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that they could replace "the principles" by "standards," which would have allowed stricter enforcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, this article has not been modified is a guarantee of its goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="27">Liberals accused of hypocrisy and believe that this is not more than a publicity trick. </seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="29">In particular, they refer to Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University a consultative role, particularly for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with the laws of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because " people call for Pronounce is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="31">Here we see the premises of a theocracy." </seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of liberals also are further compounded by the fact that the next rector of the university would be far less moderate than the current. </seg>
<seg id="33">"For now, there is no specific religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, we are in the context of marital status. </seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not ulemas, but academics, some of them trained in the French system ," explains Alexis' Blouet, which prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="36">But acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity surrounding Article 220, as the language imitate the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="37">"We are particularly referring to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr]. </seg>
<seg id="38">And the question that could arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civilian judges to rule above all this ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the widespread power conferred by the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that there are few compared with those who were during the previous regime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another sticking point: the powers of the army. </seg>
<seg id="42">According to the desire of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council. </seg>
<seg id="43">It also does not prohibit prosecutions of civilians in military courts, as demanded partnerships for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="44">They also showed their concerns relating to the text, which they see as anti-freedom. </seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained, and from now on, the insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially in the press. </seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="47">According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36. </seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not included in the previous Constitution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Although the Egyptian president was due to leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state marched Saturday. </seg>

<seg id="1">"The large and powerful" take you to Moscow: immigrants to save the language </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While deputies and human rights advocates argue about the consequences that would bring the law on mandatory review, have already appeared in the country tricksters dealing with certhified "false" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="4">Most are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since December 1 comes into force a law, under which each immigrant labour should conduct a review to check their knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention of working in the area of provision of services, institutions of community services, domestic services and retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="8">However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will be mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it will not be enough to pay the review of the language, but also of Russian history and the foundation of the legislation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit. </seg>
<seg id="11">They are exception-rule citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language. </seg>
<seg id="12">They will not be subject to this law the people who succeeded in obtaining their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Utility, inevitablity and defending the rights </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of centres will work reviewers sponsored by the Institute of Russian Language Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education Russian. </seg>
<seg id="15">Immigrants may be presented to the tests in all cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 NCPCs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="17">But the advocates, long before the law came into force, managed many times to make this question to the press: what will bring this into reality? </seg>
<seg id="18">What changes will bring the compulsoriness of the knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and the immigrants? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First, are the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people who suffer from "slave labour." </seg>
<seg id="20">Many people talk today about defending the rights of immigrants labour, said Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Immigration Service of Russia in Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="21">The defence of their rights must begin before his departure. </seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of organized selection will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="23">The problems are immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future border-crosser will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, I get a "viajecito payement" a shocking and close covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We received a number of complaints from our immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="26">"In his homeland promised one thing, but arriving are cheated, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay wages promised," confirms the head of the Directorate of labour immigration of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">No angers, jefecito! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not so much their fault, but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education. </seg>
<seg id="30">This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone already clothe them, calzarlos and buy back to school. </seg>
<seg id="31">Upon reaching adolescence, these guys have set out to work at the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize. </seg>
<seg id="33">"One feels humiliated and lower-rank." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, when it comes to the law on language, advocates point out an important point. </seg>
<seg id="35">The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="36">If they do not have that status, there will be no review and, consequently, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of immigrant workers are still living in Russia illegally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome or stopped to strangers." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many visitors say that receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="40">The case is in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself. </seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, legalization costs money: twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="42">However, a false registration can be done quickly and by only thousand rubles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, are not registered and Chizzolini cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="44">"We are asking for 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea," told journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"We are going, don't be stingy, but buying a painting." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The first day of the entry into force of the law on language, showed that not only the immigrant registration documents may be false. </seg>
<seg id="47">Several "false" certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service. </seg>
<seg id="48">The forged documents had been printed in standard colour printers. </seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, came into the hands of the new owners not as gifts: each immigrant, queriéndose facilitate the task of passing tests, paid for the paper seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="50">This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that the "diplomas'" will not be able to buy, converge officials of the government and the defenders of the rights. </seg>
<seg id="52">So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who have not been able to pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language. </seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require communication-proactive people. </seg>

<seg id="8">The network has appeared an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations gunmen, demand that they desist from such measures of "senseless thoroughness." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percentage of vandalizing use of registered weapons is minimal, told the BBC news service in Russia, the lawyer criminalista Vasiliy Lésnikov. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 offences were committed with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to the total of 1168 crimes recorded for the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the area of civil-use weapons will not be a drawback for the offender is directed to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="12">Now, in his words, Moscow can find any weapon at low prices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Supplier-parties: from fabricas to officially-accepted </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The black market weapons are supplied through various channels. </seg>
<seg id="16">The main channels are years, says Colonel retd Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High État-major. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screen-shot website that accepts orders for weapons </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first, "vestige of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military action in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="19">"The weapons were stolen by the official Russian and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The next type of "black weapon," stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="21">Baranets explained that includedd weapons stolen from the warehouses of the police and those stolen directly by officials of the organs of law enforcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal weapons come to the sale from military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="23">Many military arsenals often had explosions. </seg>
<seg id="24">"There are versions of demostrated that some fires were caused deliberately to cover the failure," says exmilitar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to Baranets, the arms manufacturers also put their bit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Now have proliferated factories deprived of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute back-channel weapons to the black market, including the Moscow," said the expert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">One more source of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="29">"There have their own production, sometimes small-scale, and it has formed a mafia that has organized the flow of arms," explains the ex-serviceman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where are the weapons? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of problems and public management planning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists reviewed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and public access data portals whose theme-by-theme revolves around the weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="35">Half of the weapons of the black market has come there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," it says in the report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to investigators, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases were stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the "illegal archaeology." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The shop-assistants of one of the weapons shops, who asked that his name was not mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal diggers purchase no one for a long time now because they are too old. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">More often, he says, suppliers are directed at military stores when they need a game. </seg>
<seg id="39">Through some alférez, the provider buys a unit, for example a gun TT. </seg>
<seg id="40">Removed from the register and pass over the fence. </seg>
<seg id="41">"This is the weapon in the city and sold at 900 euros per unit with two portering," says </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"But, of course, the police this all matters, so that periodically, when you have to meet the plan of discovery of crime, buying evidence of illegal arms traders," adds shop-assistants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"As in a luxury boutique." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The seller and the buyer are often through known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I visited websites and blogs until a kind that I proposed that would be the" Begovaya "platform, which would be a man that I would lead to a" esquinita " where we could negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="46">The price of the weapon, I learned only there." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Military commentator Viktor Baranets </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"To get a weapon I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop-assistants of the webshop. "I have a friend, but I am not very confident him." </seg>
<seg id="49">In the markets there are sellers, but there are also has to go, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked that told him that he had fallen a tooth's to his daughter." </seg>
<seg id="50">I can even get a couple of manoplas steel through a person of trust. </seg>
<seg id="51">He has also made available only to me because he knows that I am not going to delatar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The newbie are seeking weapons of different ways. </seg>
<seg id="53">The ex-serviceman Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="54">The schemes, in his words, have not changed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He delivered a photo album where there was no "all." </seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like a luxury boutique," recalls the military. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer, according to Baranets, does not provide the wool over the eyes: everything can be tested. </seg>
<seg id="58">I, as potential customers, not only buy; we are going with the seller to the forest, where we place a white. </seg>
<seg id="59">"Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure you that the weapon fired well, we began to negotiate," describes the procedure expert. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">They are striking employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as ATMs in "McDonald's" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, the United States has launched a wave of protests against the low wages paid in supermarkets in the Wal-Mart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast-food chains, such as "McDonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For now, no one dares to say whether or not this wave will come to the nine points, or if it meant losing forces and amansarse in their early stages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests have the support of unions and a number of left-wing NGOs. </seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the modest wages of the workers of Wal-Mart and the fast-food system, the objective of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions in these companies. </seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this sector of the economy has not practically been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Forty-six cents a year? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week, after the day of Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." that day, in the United States coomenzaba the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">That day, some workers from the Wal-Mart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed Picketing protest along with the unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the corporation, whose products are aimed at people of modest incomes and moderates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Wal-Mart sells everything from swaddling, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, until aspiradores, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="12">The products in their stores are average between 8% and 27% cheaper than the largest supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many low-paid workers Wal-Mart buy only on the job. </seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and variety of products have made Wal-Mart the largest corporations in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the two critical words, Wal-Mart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because little paid to their workers. </seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of lift or hand scanners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This "Black Friday" participants in the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="18">For a typical Wal-Mart worker, which receives £9.5 dollars per hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Wal-Mart increases the average salary up to 12 dollars per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="20">This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Wal-Mart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="22">In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12.39 dollars more than they spend now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Wal-Mart told satified that the protest took place only in nine states and caused no loss to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="24">The "Black Friday" ran in their stores from 8 Thursday afternoon until midnight the next day, and during that time, Wal-Mart sold around 5000.00 per second items. </seg>
<seg id="25">In total, its cash registers were the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with the website left-wing Huffington Post, who left his job "less than five" Wal-Mart employees and that the protest had been anything other than a "public relations trick," organized by the union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free box's!" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not exactly department stores Wal-Mart (which in this progress-oriented city do not have them appreciate, and that is why there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then even you ascribeplace sickness and you do not pay for your honest work! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is 7.25 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="32">The fast-food restaurants are increasing with time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="33">No one earns less than them in this city. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, it is something incomprehensible to me. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald's and there, behind the comptoirs, part-time after school, while still living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="36">Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, constantly stumble on some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live this salary, and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal is a commentary whose author says that it is irresponsible to have children if they do not know what to eat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protests, which began 6.30am Thursday morning at the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks are beginning to pay at least 15 dollars per hour, or that they will double its current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that in the area of fast food can be set up trade unions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The US law prohibits the administration from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, rarely the administration facilitates life. </seg>
<seg id="43">But, for objective reasons, it is easy for the unions covering the rápid food sector. </seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discordant </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests earlier in the day took place in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald's near Times Square, involving several local Democratic politicians, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it is selling billions of portions, and then even gives you a hospital or you pay for your honest work." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The protesters received the support of other prominent Democrats in New York, for example of the candidate for mayor of the city Bill Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast-food sector so that they will receive fair wages and economic prosperity that it deserves every NY." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described the newspaper New York Times, this has been the greatest manifestation of this kind in the American history of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended only a few hundred people, even they were not all employees of the fast-food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not yet clear whether this will spark to provoke a mass movement. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"For now, bamboozle the brain is not so easy." </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The issue of augmented reality, so popular among amateurs to modern technologies, lately is normally mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference google's showed a model in motion and then, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, a conversation with the head of the group of 3D interactive technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, finds that for the company's scientists, glasses already belonged to a by-gone stage. </seg>
<seg id="5">They attracted the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air barehanded and the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of its research group? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dedicated to persona-ordenador interaction, but also we try to expand the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="8">For now, humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels of the flatscreen, sometimes plays with the finger. </seg>
<seg id="9">But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward, and today no Xbox solded without Kinect, since everyone is interested in control by gestures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What else lies the future? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that Kinect interaction has led to the physical level, much of it still happens in a flatscreen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good. </seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including the design. </seg>
<seg id="15">We must rid the world of computer to our physical, making it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only to the user, but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a easyest way. </seg>
<seg id="18">First, the devil with these stupid helmet-wearing of virtual reality! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What you think about control by voice? </seg>
<seg id="20">A very popular detail, but it does not believe that it overestimated? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Clear that it cannot be considered a panacea, it remains to be seen to resolve the issue of privacy, because it is not always wants the other learns of our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field. </seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think of the gestures, but not in fly-away movements, but shorter. </seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a band that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="25">For now is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="26">But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How is that? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how I would ask you to spend this tin of soda? </seg>
<seg id="29">You will speak and show at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Usually I speak only. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, this is going to be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- Are you forcing users to adapt to what can or cannot do at this time the machine? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but it is a rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="34">I believe that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine accurately the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="35">These can be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If we speak of their work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have of the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="37">They lack pixel-count depth or something else? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the tri-dimensional recognizement. </seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get 8-megapixel at the speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="40">But the question is not in the Megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="41">From this last point of view, all current technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives more work to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="42">So, we must remember not only the resolution axes X and Y, but also in Z.. </seg>
<seg id="43">The speed is also important, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="44">Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30fps are truly scarce, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, our laboratory in Redmond, made a sensor's contact with adjustable retardations processing of 1 to 100 ms and worth-mentioning modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the man-machine interaction. </seg>
<seg id="47">I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of this device, but that does not require contact for the tables for the second more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- Kinect now has three "cameras'," one of which is in fact the issuer of beam and the second recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="50">But the third camera is actually a simple standard sensor's intuitable. </seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="53">Or on the other hand, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible similarThis Kinect, playing with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help the determinr tri-dimensional position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="56">It does not appear that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, spend all the time in high holding a smart phone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a platform of cloud, you could go from the glasses to the smart phone. </seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (the private things you can only see them), but also its weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow it to work on virtual objects along with other people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holográficos virtual objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man," but also for any mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no answer touch! </seg>
<seg id="61">The hands do not feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="62">What answers prepares his group for this challenge? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">In my conference I often say that augmented reality is the seventh in-breaking in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="64">I believe that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of pre-owned as support for the image. </seg>
<seg id="66">Has the touch perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really designed to provide tangible to these "images in the air." for example, the interference of several ultrasónicos rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is gives a feeling similar to the one that feels like if somebody was soplándole in the fingertips of the fingers, but this feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets for the doll that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Has tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="70">Do you think that he is what seems to be felt at the time when it sees something? </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Subjective taste instead of culture - Rosbalt. Ru </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardismo St.-Petersburg," dedicated to citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="3">This list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even known. </seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The entire city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red top-down, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in must-go and inaugurations meetings. </seg>
<seg id="6">Kirill cadres' Miller always attracts crowds, wherever they displayed. </seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of those cuentistas purely sociofilósofos St.-Petersburg, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg foresightedness of the late 80s - the early 1990's. </seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city of Arubans smiles and lifts all the mood. </seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, he took in his hands a organillo and became the organillero of St. Petersburg, as it has matured to do so difficult role, because of its bohemia existence, its philosophy and its image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why go through the town of raiment red, not yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose the red because I am fashion designer and I devote myself to the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the red color is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society. </seg>
<seg id="14">Although in society, everything that is not a little gray is truculence and nothing good turmoil of property. </seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are intended to start a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to the debate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - When comprendiste debías being an artist? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - In an exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my work is displayed. </seg>
<seg id="19">I realized that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="20">Then the wave of old inofficial artists had ended, and the new, diseasefree like me, were still misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="21">I was friend of artists in the new wave, with the subsequent setting out in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10," and ended the new wave. </seg>
<seg id="22">I sumí in the theater by clothing, the music of all genres, but not by the lyrics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - And all this joined in your Clínica art... - it was important for me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where they should gather the best creative minds. </seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I was a Pushkinskaya-10 territory and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistics club, a club bohemio, the house of bohemia of St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I recall the way in which Schnur brought the project to "the ear of Van Gogh." </seg>
<seg id="26">Schnur and his friends sang light-weapons songs under fonograma, dressed in price-adjusted trousers, among them was the currently fashionable trend-setter IGOR Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="27">When the group began playing live, it became "Leningrad." </seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received from us. </seg>
<seg id="30">Galery "D-deficiency 137a," the " Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Clínica of Art. </seg>
<seg id="31">There were our regular employees and customers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "the people of our city." </seg>
<seg id="34">The nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, thus ended my completion. </seg>
<seg id="35">In these new times, it is not convenient to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="36">In our times it is easy to be popular, but the culture and popularity are separate; one can be popular but very little ibadah. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - There are in your work something recognizable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - Many of my paintings are hits, there is clear now and the occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="39">I am going to make a scheduled exhibition, "the Russian Museum in clowns." </seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="41">I was sociable before, but now it is painful and frightening. </seg>
<seg id="42">But all embadurna in the clowns and the tragedy is eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and madatory change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="45">Now one is by clothing, moving outside, but not in the interior of the person. </seg>
<seg id="46">And, to that person it may not be him or give the hand, but escupirle in the face. </seg>
<seg id="47">And the deceitfulness will be eliminated when they change clothes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - Recently we saw you in the role of organillero larrge. - a cultured city should have a hero. </seg>
<seg id="49">Who better than me to be! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Well, but the best commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, come-up touch. </seg>
<seg id="52">We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="53">Before people are grouped in flocks, bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplones. </seg>
<seg id="54">Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a $100 ticket to wish them all. </seg>
<seg id="56">Now we have to think about who you want to like. </seg>
<seg id="57">Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - And to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - Are going to see it abandoned, there operates the sexo-social area. </seg>
<seg id="60">And a cultural event are 300 people, 10 thousand never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is fading. </seg>
<seg id="61">I have to my fans, the most important thing is not misled, not to spoil what you have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young was such cadres' that a collector was hanging on the wall on the side of Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="63">I started with paintings, with which people usually ends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="65">They say spiritual culture, consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture in consumption, that is another story. </seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused to money only to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="68">I am in favour of this culture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, what is missing from St.-Petersburg? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - Good experts in culture. </seg>
<seg id="71">There is a concept: official culture. </seg>
<seg id="72">But not all can be devoted to culture. </seg>
<seg id="73">When the kings were the correct everything was otherwise, kings may not very well understood the culture, but knew that it was necessary to maintain the correct experts. </seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow there is now very good consultores. </seg>
<seg id="75">We have people in St. Petersburg that may well be experts, but are closed, because it requires experts to a higher level to assess them properly and also the way. </seg>
<seg id="76">The subjective personal taste is now thriving. </seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - What is St.-Petersburg for you? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is ground. </seg>
<seg id="80">But on our stones, it is difficult for the art grow. </seg>
<seg id="81">We need cultural field, and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity going to exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="83">In our case, this class is very small. </seg>
<seg id="84">We need to make the art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project will be implemented with a grant of St.-Petersburg. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I believe that there is little choice. </seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="8">"These are Venus and Mars," says the researcher head of the Astronómico State Institute, P.K.) (IAES), Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="10">You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="12">It was a half-century ago carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown in orbit nothing differed in terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosófilas. </seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 were sent to the space of quail eggs to see how the embryo develops in weightlessness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We get as a result a normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="17">But then start the problems. </seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is that this chick has to find support, must be kept on their own feet and begin to move," said Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomédicos Problems (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">By failing to find support, the young were volteretas at random. </seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 hours in newborns were given a total atrophy of the instincts. </seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks did not react to light or sound. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And the misfortune was that after four days simply died. </seg>
<seg id="23">"And twice we were born chicks, but then leave it because it was impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last time a "miniarca" iomonitoring flew to the orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="26">However, in the "Bion" biosatellite travel only species of the same sex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space for fetuses. </seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, nothing supernatural was found. </seg>
<seg id="29">"This was precisely biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After the landing, space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="31">However, it has not yet been able to address the problem of reproduction directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="32">It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot do their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="34">The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an appropriate emotional fund. </seg>
<seg id="36">Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="37">But women travel to the space for more than 50 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The greatest risk was Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="39">And the most precious thing that has humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="40">Our flying seagull, and no one in the earth could say: if it is after a flight to the space. </seg>
<seg id="41">May or may not have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, no one has responded to this question," says the veteran of the aerospace sector Vachnadze Vakhtang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only after a year of space flight, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a child. </seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk persists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There are few, there are very few astronauts who after long flights have been the best result, and a healthy generation is growing. </seg>
<seg id="48">"And if you can say, it is more dangerous even in orbital flight," sums up the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">However, humanity must find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The hidrolaboratorio of the Center for cosmonaut preparation is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="51">Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their skills work in space. </seg>
<seg id="52">The water simulates the ingravidez. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If the water is a comfortable environment for an adult, although still hostile, for a newborn child is his native element. </seg>
<seg id="54">The small hombres-anfibio seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier then get used to water. </seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath-room spent only two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="57">"This is very little to forget something," says Aksenova Marina, swimming monitor of newborns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if the ingravidez is a more natural state for a newborn, women's weight is necessary, the force of gravity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The ingravidez abdominal muscles and pelvic decrepitan very fast, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we are failing that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="61">It can, of course, to give birth in a special chamber, it will push. </seg>
<seg id="62">"And then what?," Valeri Polyakov is the original question. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="64">Without the sense of gravity, the body does not create the skeleton or muscle system. </seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn in orbit is impossible vestirlo with a special training suit, as adults. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just be deprived of what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring the Earth to a disabled, a person totally unsuited," provides for the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue. </seg>
<seg id="69">However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings in their naves come to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Head of NKÚ: the inspection of the "švarc" system has failed with the political culprit </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In terms of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its application falls short. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">So says Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.Cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect," but its implementation must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," describes the current situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of an incorrect practice, mentions the Petr Ne?as attitude towards the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The prime minister said recently that the SDGs (Civic Democratic Party) would not mind entrepreneurs with inspectors. Then, is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be regulated in some way, and if something prohibits, in this case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to perform such controls or demand obligations," Kala said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the commission of control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and the German team, within the framework of which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly is it? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">This is a parallel control that we began to make for some two years. </seg>
<seg id="12">This simplified way: European legislation regulates how to organize public awards, this remains the current legislation in each country, and then the practice itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have all united and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stronger and more comprehensive," however, the specific practice in some parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What can bring this project? What do you think are the conclusions? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just a common control of this kind could help to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, reduction and improvement of the limits, although this does not have a very positive impact. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy of the savings means getting a good thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="18">But not by reducing the limit of awards means that we are going to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps because the system is saturated with both "red tape" that those who want to find flaws in the system can do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the prácticaa of public procurement procedures. </seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of controls in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="22">It is an office similar to our NKÚ or upbuilding otherwise? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Regarding offices, such as the NKÚ, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle the two offices evolve in parallel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The powers are also somewhat analógas, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level; in this regard is slightly different from our system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call here state funds. </seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In terms of local legislation, it is simpler than ours? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally, I would not like to establish a comparison without concrete data; however, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it is not possible to accurately in what is best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It could be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This certainly not, but, I repeat, I do not like to make this kind of comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as the model must cope with a large number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="32">If this is not the case, it would be no benefit to work with our office, does not believe? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for his Office Amendment law on public procurement? Manifests itself in some way its impact? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet been expressed in the actions of control. </seg>
<seg id="35">Given that we do control ex-post, it is necessary to have a certain delay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For now, it is in the process of preparing the future controls: we have launched a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks," for which we have almost impersonated public 14.000 awards, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, because the limits are modified, corrected the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">It considers that the adoption of this law is beneficial, or rather, is a mess for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that will be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise is that the regulations "tighten" and that it is impossible to do so. </seg>
<seg id="40">As with the previous rules, the SLA-controlled people were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law is not respected in terms of public contracts meant the violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It makes sense, then tighten the law in this way? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal decision, which has no effect on the decisionmaking process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create a greater bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how it comes out of this? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We will see where we take this path begun. </seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister has recently declared that the SDGs would not mind entrepreneurs with control of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="48">The švarc system " is prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be regulated in some way, and if something is forbidden, then even the prime minister of the government can prevent the performance of the Office that has the obligation to perform such checks and demand obligations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say: "Cambiamos the law and allow," but it cannot say that we will do as if nothing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public procurement, the regulation is very strict in terms of the way in which we must formally act. And that is how it should be to protect public competition. </seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to meet the formal requirements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we need. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Šimon Ornest: our concerts want to accumulate positive-energy </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is said that in a little less than a month is going to reach the end of the world, what he thinks about it? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is only one among so many other alarmist news that we like agarrarnos. </seg>
<seg id="4">The music group The Tap Tap we like rather make jokes about this, and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that wins enough positive-energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In addition, in December organizáis a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="6">You can explain it to our readers? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">This is a state charity that we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to take advantage of the potential of marketing that is the end of the Mayan calendar set out for the December 21 11:10 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="9">The previous day, 20 December at 9pm, we will organise three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="10">They will end around the same time that ends the Mayan calendar in Kiribati's island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our timezone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who did this idea? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It was initially my brainchild, then we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to wanting to collect enough positive-energy and avoid the end of the world, too, along with society, we want to reflect on the state that we will leave the world for our children. </seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original pen against the end of the world that can be purchased in www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called Akathist against the end of the world, entitled "end of the world, cancelled." </seg>
<seg id="16">Today is very popular on YouTube, you can hear in the benefit concerts? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course yes, and it will be just the latest, well, provided that everything goes well and will not stop the world... </seg>
<seg id="18">Sing all the performers at the same time in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="19">Anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously through the special broadcast live on the Czech Television. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and interprets the central role of Jesus in the videoclip, which also sings Xindl X.. </seg>
<seg id="21">How came this collaboration? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable initiatives and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="23">We put all our efforts to participate in this project. </seg>
<seg id="24">It has been shown that most of them are interested in and amused them to work with us. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What the money will be raised in the concert against the end of the world? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Equipment for the school without Studeo barriers, which we term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association in Tap Jedličkův ústav. </seg>
<seg id="27">The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav are regularly visited by teachers with the activities that are fun and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="28">The students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and do a efuerzo to make it possible. </seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building that we will move with this project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In each concert act various groups and interpreters. </seg>
<seg id="31">What are the selection criteria? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague serving Chinaski, Lesbiens Support, Illustratosphere Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="34">For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">You have planned any other similar "spectacular action" in the future? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we will act for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here surely will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, it also we would like to play in the National Bohemian Hall in New York and to me, personally, while we are in the United States, I would be complemented by actions in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, you have so far acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="40">How is the logistics and organization of these trips? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not so difficult how it might seem at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="42">There are five members in electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and also carry much weight, the boxes with the tools... </seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which continues to amaze me. </seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, everything went smoothly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="46">What you have found so far? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Luxembourg, in Madrid, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go. </seg>
<seg id="48">Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not often that a person would travel alone in the center of the city in an electric wheelchair. </seg>
<seg id="49">Something as common as, for example, is to give preference to someone in wheelchair lift, it is not there. </seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, it has created a civil association that strives to focus attention on the problems of persons with disabilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Where we need to take an example of more developed countries? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many aspects that we are behind... </seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people who are directly affected. </seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is very normal for people with a serious disability moves on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever... </seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we are a bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="56">A society that respects or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes in the emerging eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change all of truth. </seg>
<seg id="57">Until now, they are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I went as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where he had many young people to my about wanting to engage in something. </seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker. </seg>
<seg id="61">And with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we was a bit of the hands (laughs). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">However, the popularity did not arrive until the past few years, or am I wrong? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work is not, it is as if it did not exist. </seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to aid from the European Union, we can afford to also teaching-staff quality, equipment, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">You had intended to go so far with The Tap Tap? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I saw the potential that he had, that something can be done differently. </seg>
<seg id="68">The world of entertainment is full of things that resemble each other. </seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical, in its own way, everything new is with caution and takes a long time to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="70">There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="71">The impression that someone sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="72">But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not Deserted beings who suffer and that we should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, with the necessary means. </seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then, is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the entire society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Helped by the fact that you are a demanding boss, as he describes many people? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to make a quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="77">I think it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a long time travelling and concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="79">But that is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently the Tap Tap The group has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, people come in and out, cannot be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="84">Anyone who will and desire will always find the doors open </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the day before the expected end of the world, 20.12.2012 on Thursday at 9pm </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno and Plynojem Fléda in Ostrava and will join 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconferencia to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "end of the world, canceled" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multi-functional equipment of the barrier-free educational centre in STUDEO Jedličkův ústav of Prague, costing 25 million Czech crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The entrance to the concert costs 400 CK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the option of presale Bohemiaticket </seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week accepted Poland as twelfth member of the European Space Agency. It is the second ESA member country of the former bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland launched an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years participated in the commission of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="4">However, the path of Poland to the cosmos started much earlier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Polish enthusiasts are already engaged in flights to the space before the Second World War, although not always understood their work. </seg>
<seg id="6">I remember, for example, the Šternfeld Uba conference at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw, 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study "introduction to cosmonáutica." </seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left indifferents assistants, and years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr Jan Gadomski had been the only one that had shown interest in their work. </seg>
<seg id="8">In the year 1934 Šternfeld Robert Esnault-Pelterie prize won in France and André Louis Hirsch for his "introduction to the cosmonáutica." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonáutica. </seg>
<seg id="10">He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became a promoter of the cosmonáutica, was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when his name was one of the craters of the hidden side of the moon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">As early as 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was to be equipped with an engine of rockets. </seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, it is not clear who was the author of the proposal and did not know the destalles of the project. </seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used for the start of the dresina or for braking. </seg>
<seg id="15">Information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to engage in missiles. </seg>
<seg id="17">The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim teacher. </seg>
<seg id="18">On the basis of the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stadium testing practices. </seg>
<seg id="19">However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 appeared in the press -specialized the prototype of a hunting photoelectric missile designed by Rohoziński engineer and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba i lotnicza," Leliwa-Krzywoblocki the author. </seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were intended for the military use of the engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, the interim scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all the projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinating all the work. </seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other studies devoted to the cosmonáutica appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="25">In the 1954 November edition of the magazine Problemy was first referred to the society with four large articles devoted to space. </seg>
<seg id="26">One of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to the cosmonáutica. </seg>
<seg id="27">At that time had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (pesetas) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the pesetas became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="29">The following year the first president of the pesetas, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902- 1959), became the vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation. </seg>
<seg id="30">He played this position until his death in 1959. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the pesetas significantly participated in the development of the carrier-rocket RM10 probe (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocketship in which scientific research was carried out. </seg>
<seg id="32">The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket had a height of 1800 meters, about 80 cm long and less than 5 kilograms of weight. </seg>
<seg id="34">Later, completed the RM-1A version and in summer 1959 begancommenced air testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets in the desert of Błędów. </seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket measured 1.4 metres and weighed about $11,500,000 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="36">Another type of rocket development was going to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocketship was going to have a height of 14.5-per kilometers and its mission would be controlling the wind up. </seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962 the work was suspended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor to the first rocket RM10 was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="39">It was designed as rocketship in two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="40">Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed with each other for the space available for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="41">Meteor-1A rocketship the space available for volume was 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C 0.62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="42">The peak in the three types was 37 kilometers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between the years 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Air Institute Meteor-2 carrier-rocket, whose first air tests were initiated in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="44">The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kilograms and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kilograms up to 60 kilometers in height. </seg>
<seg id="45">The Meteor-2H version was subsequently built and Meteor-3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We must also mention the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="47">In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the investigation of the cosmic space on artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the pilot Polish Mr. Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimir Remek. </seg>

<seg id="1">The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week the constitutional court suspended the social traabajos law. </seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society. </seg>
<seg id="4">Of course it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a wider point of view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation. </seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, this means that the different ways economic and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="7">The case is on the principle of free trade and free movement and unlimited private capital, along with the rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="8">The effect of the big differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, try catching up to do so "creates a bajadda" of the price of the competitor with the aim of taking most of the market, and thus increase its profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="10">Mega-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buy there cheaper or dissappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries in which the price of work, in comparison with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility whatsoever, and with it, nor is it responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon creates, necessarily growing social spending in the state. </seg>
<seg id="12">All this situation fosters the total number of uninterestedness entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damage that have resulted in its pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is universally known so that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital, in particular economies, create situations in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population, and thus attract foreigners to the country. </seg>
<seg id="15">Put another way, the government put private capital at the disposal of its own population without taking into account the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="16">This is evident mainly in the changes of existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="18">This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights. </seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty along with the increase in the gap between poor and rich. </seg>
<seg id="20">For a number of years, there are German points of delivery of food for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people who receive this type of aid already reaches the 1000000. </seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: employees with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive. </seg>
<seg id="23">It was made public such a scandal related to the situation of flaggers employees of the German federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="24">The savings of almost all the southern states of the EU drive, without doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by a precipitous decline in its social level, they are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or malvivir with a poor salary on the edge of society, with the hope that one day arrives in the country capital private investor. </seg>
<seg id="25">It is necessary to preguntrarse where it comes? </seg>
<seg id="26">In the case in question from other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or is never to be reached, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans are working for a tiny part of a European salary. </seg>
<seg id="27">This also affects all Latinamerica. </seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theories and the media claim to death that the state should not provide capital to the economy, which lead the economy leads to its failure. </seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control. </seg>
<seg id="30">Then, it is necessary to ask whether the private capital has no influence with his selfishness in the political march, and thus throughout the state. </seg>
<seg id="31">In this case, the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="32">The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and pervasive, in all the states. </seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, log-rolling, a law that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is the following: government ministries, in the absence of financial means, responsible for drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="35">Such bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament. </seg>
<seg id="36">In this way, all the power is not the choice of the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation how Appiános describes in his book The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeya: "The state was disintegrating time and administrations were to force." </seg>
<seg id="38">In return for bribes, favors illegally obtained and aid to finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption swept unimpeded and people went to the polls with the apalabrado vote in advance ..."" was not as people who wanted to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls ..."" he started to talk seriously that the only remedy for a very serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man ..." though Appiános was thinking about Pompeya, Cesar came to power and transformed democracy forever in autocracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion, just as in ancient times, is that the current society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefits without taking into account the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital does not, in its essence, is able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="42">The result is the same as then, a decline of the unprecedented elite, without make an effort to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="43">The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes, therefore, should be sought in the unbridled liberalisation of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="44">With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, such as a clear break, waiting for the next blow. </seg>
<seg id="45">The really damning fact is that the current elite it completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in the old and the most recent history. </seg>
<seg id="46">The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution; at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure from the economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="49">The solution lies in socio-political concrete reforms, which strengthen both the participation of the capital of the state as the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state. </seg>

<seg id="6">I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. At the end of the day, citizens today in Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not lived the beginnings of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="7">My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who profit from the tensions that have been facing for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, other conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the issue, about who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the history of mankind the history of the struggle for power is in the front row. </seg>
<seg id="10">Each time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleón.. </seg>
<seg id="11">But what is no longer so obvious is whether these were always characters running their self-accounting steps or behind his throne had someone to guide their actions towards a particular goal. </seg>
<seg id="12">We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates wealth in the world in the hands of a few individuals and this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been able to get in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="13">Among these families astronomically rich Emphasizes that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I am not ruling out): Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="14">Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="15">Of course. </seg>
<seg id="16">In the 1990s of the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating his name with criminal acts critically. The power and wealth, or both, they covered the backs, which cleverly meant a strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="17">They have significant stakes in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries that are not represented, has been declared or is preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after toppling el-Qaddafi just four, but Russia has meanwhile linked the central bank to the Russian government. </seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Civil War to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (EDF) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936 after trying to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Its quest for global power led them over the years 1859-1871 to chart a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with 33 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was designed to eliminate the big states Monarchists across Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third was to reduce the population of the land between half a million and one billion people (similar amount of slaves for their wellbeing and luxury and would not be sufficient consumed so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="23">The method with which operates the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order Intestate cao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions, however, are wrong, and always carries a worsening of the situation, but it is not enough to remember that the EDF was created to not repeat a crisis such as the year 1.907. </seg>
<seg id="25">So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after that, in the wake of this, the First World War broke out, vandalizing Czarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic terms, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Czarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire. </seg>
<seg id="27">To prepare the ground for the Second World War, allowing establishment bankers and politicians, covertly, a conflictual situation following the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating optimum conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough to serve the Germans the solution of the führers, which was sufficiently strong and simple and drew guilty, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and so well represented the role of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and caused the outbreak of war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the former Judaea with its capital in Jerusalem (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="29">The Balfour Declaration IMIC laid the foundations for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflict with the Arab population of the place. </seg>
<seg id="30">There were terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="31">The outbreak of the Second World War: it is difficult to know if Hitler too threw the rope that had bound international bankers initially or if everything they did was part of a plan; however, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the global society. </seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948, and similar to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers would start, the Jewish nation, as well as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of his country, but also at international level. Let us consider how they are divided so strong supporters and detractors of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their zeal for global power? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its mandate--holders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only presented to their candidates in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="37">The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to declare war on Iran, and considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to become a global conflict, and if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the entire world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the global economy. </seg>

<seg id="1">Argo film: if it is crude, call Hollywood </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 a group of the demonstration of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomaed hostage. </seg>
<seg id="3">His release was to be in exchange for the shah dethroned Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution fled to USA, which had sponsored his regime for decades. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throw the shah away could not be allowed, since, if it did, jeopardizing the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the formation of the theocratic regime, was not at its disposal. </seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later have been further intensified with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="7">Diplomats in prison were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention by the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="8">In the US, their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="9">The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film "Argo" director and actor Ben Affleck addresses an episode of this story, which was a small success for America. </seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building. </seg>
<seg id="12">After a complicated journey, ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy. </seg>
<seg id="13">CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, got out of Iran, this helped a covert history an extravagant point: came with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a surfeit of science fiction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Gender mix </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan outlined by the expert on "ex-filtration" Toni's Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="16">For the bullshit seem accurate, wrote about the film project in journals, press conferences were organized, the society of fictitious production even had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film Affleck is a unique combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper's movie," the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the series most recently Ocean's Eleven). </seg>
<seg id="20">The film combines the moods. There is a well-documented sequentialism side of Tehran. in the sequence of credits are emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were embodied in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this respect. </seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, tipical scenes of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="22">And furthermore, scenes from the central CIA and other institutions: trajeados men who discussed the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="24">The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his approach has ceased to be the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, after "small goodbye, goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town: city of stealers" (2010). </seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up. </seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the site was a feature that placed old movie directors above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck demonstrated in Argo, where Tehran was "wheel" in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story is a step forward. </seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the imposter team in the bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action in too many places </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the film sense of the most intriguing scenes. </seg>
<seg id="33">And manages well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here goes all so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the pursuit after their dancefloor become crazy). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is the disorder that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood BusinessPartner, although its characters deserve more space and are not the only ones in this film. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For these reasons, the film Affleck loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can continue with a moderate interest, valuing achieveing and the retro feel of a thriller that evokes the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="37">But that will collapse, it will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="38">As evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated that can be omnipresent and omnisciencia notions of the secret services, is sufficient. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominated absurd nonsense is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policies between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, women are aventajaban better prices in life insurance because objectively represent a lower risk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Other incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can be proposed by the people until the end of this year." </seg>
<seg id="7">The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013 ," reported Nacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponentes to the fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers lifelong only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or guideline sombre the size of the cages of the hens, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A quality Platano must have a length of 14 inches. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The apparatus of the Union takes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, is demanding the demands of their banks). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher quality bananas should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centrimetres and could not present "abnormal curvaturas." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended itself by saying that it only seeks to harmonize national standards not homogenized to date, which only complicate their marketing. </seg>
<seg id="14">The rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive carries a waste of foodstuffs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the US last year that the inflables blimps traded is compulsory to warn that children under eight years of age are not allowed to inflarlos without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="16">The US here referred to an American study which shows that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by asphyxiation. </seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction is also applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Curious occurrences are born even in our country </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To avoid the sensitivity of Greece, it must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Faire Laissez, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state. </seg>
<seg id="21">The EU found investment-ceiling volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="22">Then, the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the volume set for canned mushrooms, which was a threat of substantial fine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey also asked them the occurrence of pay for those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="24">This kind of ideas emerged not in Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage by not having. </seg>
<seg id="26">We appeal to the European Union compensation ," declared in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="27">He argued with the fact that in our country was much grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention buying, the state had filled warehouses and had to be exported. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should paying us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="30">The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the ministry for local development led by the Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, is intended to the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: rare prescriptions' are an exception </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The guidelines of the member states are often criticized, the EU's efforts in terms of regulations, and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more, according to several experts, our recognition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to experts, the most serious problem, for example, is the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the member states have achieved in the negotiations on budgets. </seg>

<seg id="35">The Czechs, after six years of disputes with German and Austrian, defended successfully the designation of origin of the Olomouc requesón, but had to rename the national rum, whose tradition in our country back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemák." </seg>

<seg id="10">It is not giving back to those who have voted? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I always stated that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the election of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="12">Later stated that if Mamola- was elected senator, I would submit my candidacy for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="13">But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can realize my own ideas. </seg>
<seg id="14">That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate. </seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but we ride roughshod over to anyone who wants to start a change. </seg>
<seg id="16">This is compounded by the media, which will undermine and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="17">I said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We are going to talk about their ideas. </seg>
<seg id="19">It is presented to the presidential struggle with disseration financial and criminal responsibility of politicians and the statement of ownership above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="20">This must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="21">As president does not have this competition and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation. </seg>
<seg id="22">How you want to resolve it? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure to guide oficio should be recognised as self-employment, and we did. </seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, either right-wing or left-wing, was rejected on purpose, and this applies to citizens. </seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups. </seg>
<seg id="26">Without encasillamientos or party dogma, I have the ability to choose something of each party that is better for our country and implement it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Rather is considered a right-wing or left-wing man? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the point of view Czech, I have the impression that people considered me more left-wing. </seg>
<seg id="29">It is not important to me, either a little left or a little right. </seg>
<seg id="30">What matters to me is that we come out ahead. </seg>
<seg id="31">I do not care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite the people. </seg>
<seg id="32">Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or SDGs, and in the same way, I am against bad ideas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It makes a joke when it says that you are populist. </seg>
<seg id="34">But it is not proving with what he says? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="36">And you try to go to them. </seg>
<seg id="37">There will be callers populism, but all the proposals that I speak are already in operation in the world or known experts speak of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of the parliament only left slogans. </seg>
<seg id="39">And this cannot survive in the long-term policy. </seg>
<seg id="40">Or you think that if you go to the people and talk with them, will, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other choice. </seg>
<seg id="42">To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to do so. </seg>
<seg id="43">If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live telecast on television in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties that legitimaran criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors in the state. </seg>
<seg id="44">And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they did not want to. </seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong character who points out disputes, pressure can be done on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time I say that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="48">For my views and ideals attempt to seek allies. </seg>
<seg id="49">I just start in politics and try to get the greatest possible support for my agenda. </seg>
<seg id="50">I am trying things forward myself, but if they do not do a good job, within six years I will leave it and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sounds a bit as if it were Okamura to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am no savior. </seg>
<seg id="53">I know that a person does not do anything, so I visited a number of well-known personalities, as if the best animaran to present his candidacy for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="54">I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="55">For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the fraud with light heating oil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I was on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, I am now in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="59">People chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to achieve change. </seg>
<seg id="60">However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">He is considering forming his own party? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not yet seen because I have no time to do so, to check the past character of each of the potential members of the party, nor have money. </seg>
<seg id="63">I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency, in my transparent account, there are only 20 kroners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">There is no money? </seg>
<seg id="65">Statements of ownership, how is it theirs? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I think my private property in some 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a field valued at 25 million, an apartment valued 10 million, another apartment appraised in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, an Aston Martin some 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million. </seg>
<seg id="68">Indeed, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women, and at the same time, fighting evil and injustice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">An Aston Martin leadeth, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="70">You said that you want to change the republic, but do not want to put too much money on their side. </seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="73">I have to endeudarme? </seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign have already put 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that it has no sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my agenda. </seg>
<seg id="76">And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with my pocket money. </seg>
<seg id="77">The costs of the campaign cover essentially what will get salary of a senator. </seg>
<seg id="78">But it could not live it. For example, could not pay my son the English school, which costs $30 monthly kroners. </seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to earn money, then I would not make as a candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So we will continue with its business to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="81">He has not said earlier that he was going to leave this activity? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This has nothing to do with a higher salary. </seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, in part I have done my activities. </seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring. </seg>
<seg id="85">People wanted to be the Samaritan salvase the republic. </seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to live something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much is used to win every month as an entrepreneur? </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The MVRDV architecture study shows that the real endevours are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I think the building is fun, has a futuristic aspect, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a bystander that passes through the streets. </seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, technical IT in a large company located near the library, said: "In addition, the building is beautiful." </seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why we need a library today. </seg>
<seg id="5">We all have the Internet, tablets, and ebooks. </seg>
<seg id="6">No one is likings in those libraries old-fashioned, no? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a bed-space city located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honour of having won a record to forget. </seg>
<seg id="8">The population of 72332 inhabitants presents the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="9">To counter this shameful situation, some years decided to contribute in any way to the general culture and copy the fictitious seven bridges that are represented in the euro banknotes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete decorated. </seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="11">And it was as well as policymakers decided that only there was a chance to improve the statistics: it had to build a library! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, the study of MVRDV Dutch architecture, a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun buildings at the same time cynical, took the issue with his usual serenity and came to the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on the face. </seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury looked perplexed around them and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack books by YESmilar forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Estimated fellow citizens: </seg>
<seg id="14">Here are my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg' ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rose on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="16">This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and town houses. </seg>
<seg id="17">In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012." </seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project is also nominated to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In this way, the small town devoid of history, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly ayuntamiento upon whose white facade one rather a intuiría dairy, now has a work of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="20">But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the book </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a and cheese production. </seg>
<seg id="23">It is true that there is a lift that brings us right at the heart of this massif, but the real lovers of space and reading not-in-kind, but they prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top. </seg>
<seg id="24">The interior glass is completely bright and easy to cover with the sight, the recocido brick floor and the elegant street lamps unequivocally support the public status of the library. </seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="26">The look may come to see the banks of the park, dogs and children playing football. </seg>
<seg id="27">And on all sides books, books and more books. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and the center opens a huge dark room, which usually tends to be something uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="29">What we have done is to put upside down the classical space configuration and draw the reading area of the interior to the outside. </seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are offices, the library of the Internet, chess club, the center of environmental education and the maintenance room. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Deserve special mention black shelves that assume the functions of mural coating, parapet and railing at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="32">The sight, touch and smell are strange. </seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and civil engineers more to the day shake the head when they hear talk of this material unknown. </seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="35">And it is as well as a day, on a farm frisia, we have the proper by-product from agriculture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, hot-housing and in the fields of the Netherlands a plastic fabric of scarse mm thickness is used as a base to hold the rootcrops. </seg>
<seg id="37">This is a cheap and efficient material. </seg>
<seg id="38">This tissue lasts two seasons and then discarded. </seg>
<seg id="39">For the library this fabric is prensó, for the first time in such quantities, to get plates of four inches thick. </seg>
<seg id="40">With the heat and pressure, the so-called plastic food-crop (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and resilient smeller to a mixture of new car and sports shoe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105-109 steps come to the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 meters around the mountain lies the reward: from the cafeteria is not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy a Dutch flavorful croquetas and planted ficus in huge pots. </seg>
<seg id="43">These create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time maintaining adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for a new soundpost </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Perish the thought, given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="46">Heating and cooling needed can be obtained from Geothermic. </seg>
<seg id="47">Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even in the most sunny days only the sun shines few hours at home. </seg>
<seg id="48">The huge wooden cerchas located in thing,62 across the glass facade serve to shade and absorb the majority of the rays of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="49">This creates a comfortable atmosphere inside. </seg>
<seg id="50">The rest is automatic blinds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the sector of the Information Technology, has already dared to put the foot in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="52">And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="53">Similarly, the professor of TCM Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library; it calls the "Boekenberg" as the "klate soul" of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="54">The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place just a couple of weeks ago, invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of his private collection. </seg>
<seg id="55">In this way is to fill, for the moment, the optical Controlsa's of a library that still does not have its complete archive; now has 70,000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has far-reaching. </seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are full. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the people have a certain link with this building. </seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of the library. </seg>
<seg id="61">Although only is there to embellish. </seg>
<seg id="62">In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a success in that reigneth discipline in the specialiced slang is known as "creation of an identity." </seg>
<seg id="63">The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="64">No matter how young and uneducated it may be. </seg>
<seg id="65">Finally a starting point for shaping their identity. </seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The Germans must play a stronger role." </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations in the US - Europe, this puts Berlin in a fairly difficult diplomatic position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: beginning of this week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the observer-state status of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="5">However, finally Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="6">Why? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="8">However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful. </seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I think that also supports the American position. </seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical with Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was to establish a zone of flight ban. </seg>
<seg id="12">This has finally been declared by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when major international issues are at stake? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, this is the case. </seg>
<seg id="15">This is because we are currently refocusing its foreign policy, away from a policy, so to speak, led by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="16">And what makes it even more difficult things is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy. </seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="18">They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to do so. </seg>
<seg id="19">I think they are still probing what their role, but they have already begun the path towards a "normal" foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="20">A similar foreign policy to countries such as France or Great Britain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What specifically means a "normal" foreign policy from the point of view German? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend different positions to the United States or its European partners. </seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="24">The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers, and for that reason Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests have influenced the position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the vote of the UN? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="27">For this reason should be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor Arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="28">This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="29">But I do not give it so much importance since this is not a totally unilateral relationship. </seg>
<seg id="30">However, it played a key role in the German considerations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It has undermined Germany its relationship with the US to abstain from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding. </seg>
<seg id="33">For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain some respect. </seg>
<seg id="35">At the end of the day, all this has done nothing but show that it is a country taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="37">In contrast, the US has been clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="38">There is disparity of views between US and many European nations? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">There have always been these disparities due to the US domestic policy. </seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration shows secretly a great understanding towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="41">But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public. </seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real disparity of opinion is not really the extent perceived. </seg>
<seg id="43">If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy that develops. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is difficult for Germany reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="46">Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a homogenous and coherent European policy, but it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, do not have the opportunity to be part of a higher body, but they must boost things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="48">That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that in the future, Germany will assume a leadership role to play in forcing Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="50">Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply by the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="51">This was always a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans have clear that they must play the role of independent figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself in the role of important international player? He actually wishes to Germany to take a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="54">Or perhaps still finds it difficult to accept that leadership? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not yet been used, it is always something unconfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is costing play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="56">Looking at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as the main actor, unleashing some antialemanes sentiments. </seg>
<seg id="57">This is not easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="58">This is an old problem, and it is that nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries. </seg>
<seg id="59">Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="60">It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The US influence in European politics are decreasing, but the EU does not cover this time Vaccum, who is then? </seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will remain no choice but to take a stronger role. </seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they don't like, if it is unpleasant or if it becomes an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie! </seg>

<seg id="1">"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly in Chinese brands </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a well-known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren as well. </seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Ortí? </seg>
<seg id="4">After this name is a name officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="5">However, it enjoys protection while the real epónimos did not submit a demand. </seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear that they are going to give the reason. </seg>
<seg id="7">"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of rights protection in Far East. </seg>
<seg id="8">Every week comes to my table a new case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="10">In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="11">German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a spider in the fosterage seats in the office of lables in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company called record Zegna brand Puma DF, amachine name is also served in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Chinese are world champions in that copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known. </seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities, there are large stores of several plants devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeit goods. </seg>
<seg id="16">However, the cases of Pattloch are non-infrastructure. On behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the trademark office officially gives Chinesecompanies the right to take advantage of a name that is already recorded elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese called "Mings Pai Bang" or brand companion. </seg>
<seg id="18">The word has its origins in the Chinese word "Bang Dakuan." </seg>
<seg id="19">Referring to women who have "fish" to a rich man. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is bad for the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands. </seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is water, the monopoly disappears, and the damage suffered by the image is enormous." </seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the costs of the sectors affected millionaires, especially in the case of emblematical luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company CLSA market analysis, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third luxury goods market and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="25">However, achieving the cancellation of registration of dubious legality in the trademark is complicated and also mean a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="26">The process can be extended to nine years and the outcome is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name of the demand-related object had already become a "market reality." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"If the plaintiff has bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to plagiador because the process has damaged the brand in China," says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphics. </seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has been absorbed recently by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="32">That is why today the Chinese can continue using an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="33">The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used the principle a logo in white and blue that largely reminded BMW; the matter was litigated in the courts and Geely had to amend it. </seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer of Lacoste clothing lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose logo was a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="36">The CTMO lables office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="37">Last year, however, "the emergency work returned to normal." </seg>
<seg id="38">In this way, the number of re-claiming processes without aciton has been reduced by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="40">However, 81.500 claims are still pending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Fighting this costs millions </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As usual in China, the figures are surprising. </seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="44">This would be a new record and means that China leads to tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations around the world, according to the office of lables. </seg>
<seg id="45">It seems that this is also the case with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total. </seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in fees. </seg>
<seg id="47">Put another way, this means that each average registration costs 1.28 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Fighting this costs millions, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the group in court fight against a Chinese copycat. </seg>
<seg id="50">While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts. </seg>
<seg id="51">The copier has managed to secure the rights to the brand Chinese Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="52">"We have caused this situation because in Germany Surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="53">The office of lables CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the muniqueses. </seg>
<seg id="54">The following two-instance have given the reason Freudenberg, but the opposite party is still fighting today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Great care must be taken </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The case has now arrived at the gates of the High Court of Justice, which is still pending. </seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler hoped to positively resolve the issue and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="58">However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time." </seg>
<seg id="59">It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the corporate file has had to revise records of up to a hundred years old to be able to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="60">For five years Freudenberg offered the adversary a "six figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but did not succeed. </seg>
<seg id="61">"This shows how much we care," says Wentzler. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in Far East even threaten to affect Europe. </seg>
<seg id="63">Specifically whether copycats there ensures the rights to unsafeguarded brands. </seg>
<seg id="64">Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany Freudenberg name for leather shoes and products. </seg>
<seg id="65">Long ago that the group abandoned this business, but prevented the registration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"Great care must be taken," says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and Pattloch lawyer advises German companies that are extremely cautious about doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but that what needs to be done is "also recorded in China everything that can be capable of protection," as is Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the issue may be much more expensive than a simple registration. </seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, then would have to pay to the opposite side of royalties by their own name, as explained Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="71">That or in the segment in question, we would be removed from the market. </seg>

<seg id="1">World day of the fight against AIDS: dance, sing, help </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg tested the Imbongi chorus and in Swaziland both welcomed the plight of AIDS orphans </seg>
<seg id="3">The story of a link capable of overcoming far more 8.733 miles away. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First you start by dancing: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and mocasines look for the compass on the parquet floor, and found quickly. </seg>
<seg id="5">One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="6">Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), arremolinándose, entorpeciéndose and following each other. </seg>
<seg id="7">Hopf and Fiete, the director of 29 years, threatens to almost get their boxes in trying to bring order with their energetic and gentle gestures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday in the afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg Imbongi choir is trying a new song. </seg>
<seg id="9">Fifty singers have also arrived, between 23 and 69 years, from the human geneticist to the homemaker. </seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every voice of the choir has a different text, and also in a foreign language barely known: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Support for the Self-Support </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS, all over the world, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland, there are 245000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="15">More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany padrinos for the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="17">Seventy of them attend secondary school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros a month can sponsor a child. </seg>
<seg id="19">This contribution will cover the school fees, uniform and guaranteed a hot meal a day in the Gogo Center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in Zulu "on-teller stories" or "panegirista." </seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows in this room fluent in Karaim Bantu, but sing know-nots. </seg>
<seg id="22">For ten years this chorus tested songs in this gentle foreign-tongue that sometimes can carry them to their place of origin: southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="23">8.733 miles away straight from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German chorus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty per cent are infected </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud huts and straw, a large proportion of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 already have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="27">Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy around the world, according to Unicef. </seg>
<seg id="28">The population does not welcomed circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce half the risk of infection. </seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the virus from the virus, and die with a little more than 30 years has become commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered this obscure population, but what they saw mainly were many children in the streets that not only lacked the protection of their parents, but the main: food, clothing and training. </seg>
<seg id="31">Without off-school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more scarce. </seg>
<seg id="32">Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few who made it possible for a child to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros. </seg>
<seg id="33">However, a year after the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" that has since been professionally addressed the plight of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="36">Among DTS's bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="37">DTS's most common virus origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="38">The ladillas and scabiesa are among DTS's transmitted by parasites. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups affected? </seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute Robert Koch part of the basis that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="42">In the case of adults non-same-sex the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomonas, human papillomavirus, thrush (fungus) and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group. </seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people, chlamydia are much more common than in other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="46">In our country, the human papillomavirus will also be added to the most common diseases among young people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has evolved the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="48">Not all of the sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration. </seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Institute Robert Koch, the number of infections by syphilis has doubled its number of 1697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new infections has maintained a downward trend since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="51">Approximately 2.700 cases were recorded in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="52">This is a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinating inconveniencies, Terra-MODIS, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="55">Often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore not be detected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect one? </seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer protection to fully-owned. </seg>
<seg id="58">Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirtiness and by physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="59">For this reason, the experts recommend regularly undergo medical examinations, especially if it changes often of sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="60">If they are diagnosed early, the majority of DTS's can be cured, and it is possible to avoid any klate consequence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through colaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their actions throughout Germany, come to raise enough money. </seg>
<seg id="62">"In total we have already sent two hundred thousand euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="63">A woman Zodwa Dlamini in his own people sure of itself and with leadership manages the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="64">It deals with orphan-care to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The "gogos," as referred to older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people. </seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have up to 14 orphans in his office, offer them a roof to live and deal with children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="67">Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary of the association. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a dress-making school, has built two barns and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has made that many of the inhabitants of the town have been subjected to an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="69">This is not something obvious, given that, despite what patent is this disease throughout the country, are not usually speak openly about it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 manacles </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality." </seg>
<seg id="72">A rarity in a country in which the king officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of Africa's Black, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses. </seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="75">This way of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="76">But it also must be phalanxes individuals who travel the country from one side to another, and that they take wherever they go. </seg>
<seg id="77">According to Annette Lennartz," in any corner can get free condoms, but these are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="78">It is another culture, here only accept contact against skin." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To promote cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years for South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, pugnacity, hope and confidence in the black, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white singing songs in a language of black; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and much joy, but also has been extracting a couple of tears to another rabid border soldier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singers visit children sponsored. </seg>
<seg id="82">Despite the fact that this small population barely appears in the maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is well known. </seg>
<seg id="83">"Visit Esitjeni, there is light," says the people of the place. </seg>
<seg id="84">And after touring 8.733 miles straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer street full of singers marking the passage, you realize that it is also possible to see shine its light from there. </seg>

<seg id="6">The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadows has formed a layer of ice. </seg>
<seg id="7">It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water presumably comes from comets, or with high probability of asteroids that eventually crashed into one Mercury. </seg>

<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that offer us have ever more depth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world. </seg>

<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="59">Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters. </seg>
<seg id="60">The drawback of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="6">There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity. </seg>
<seg id="7">A search for footprints in a country in which people from 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="9">The minibus was moving with great crashing through the winding road that passes to the side of forested hills, rivers of wealth and the simple houses of local farmers. </seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is in the Black Forest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="12">Here are the "talyshi," a town in which not much is known, apart from perfectly dominate the Persian and Azerbaijani and are very trees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Our final destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="14">This small town boasts a perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet Union and that seems not entirely fit in a mountainous landscape as picuresque. </seg>
<seg id="15">European tourists barely come to this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, it is too heavy. </seg>
<seg id="16">Travel to the 323 kilometers separating the two cities, eight hours are needed because the road is one-way. </seg>
<seg id="17">The staggering wealth enjoyed by the country, thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet come to this obscure region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to be to become a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="21">Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black-and-white image. </seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">A son died at the age of $136.0 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of Müslümov Şirali sheep, which seems to have lived $168.0 years. </seg>
<seg id="25">However, there is no birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="26">And if we take into account that the older man under-recorded lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="27">"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times and had 23 children. He still had time to conceive a daughter more at the age of $136.0 years. </seg>
<seg id="29">Then Şirali Müslümov has been wrong in his age in a couple of decades? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="31">"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan are also elderly people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, there are many older men." </seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age, especially when there is no civil registry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day glassfuls melted butter </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="35">At present, there are 20 people who exceed 100 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="36">Why live here, in the south, so many elderly? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The tourist guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis. </seg>
<seg id="38">The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food. </seg>
<seg id="39">From a nutritional point of view, however, does not seem logical that food rich in talyshi calories, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, daily drink a glass of melted butter, is so healthy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or perhaps it is the form of natural life that keeps young people? Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="41">His 97 years is relatively young for what is fashionable by these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="43">Sitting on the ground, tirelessly wiggles a huge tub of butter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live under a roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="45">They also cavort around two small children. </seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen preparing for the guests tea, a tea serving in a typical glasses with abombada form. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The Mirzayeva teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the hanky hides two long mats of dark hair that her son reveals proud. </seg>
<seg id="48">I have always washed hair with milk, which is why I never has fallen and has maintained its color. </seg>
<seg id="49">"I have never used a shampoo," says Mirzayeva. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The pension is enough to live </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">He has always eaten only what was producing in his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="52">In all my life I have never been shopping at a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="53">Then we spoke of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="54">The worst was the time after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="55">However, all returned to their feet when the "dear father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a larger woman. </seg>
<seg id="57">However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes to the fatherly figure of the nation, which runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">He remained in power until 2003, when he gave in to his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="59">At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know what is poverty. </seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva is 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount that can live well taking into account the situation here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And perhaps the canoso Mirzayeva son is right: "In our culture the elderly are highly respected." </seg>
<seg id="62">They live in a large family, they are loved, receive all necessary care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="63">As if this were not enough reason to stay alive many years... </seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrations competing in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired. </seg>
<seg id="4">The future constitution, with Choura as a basis, it is very controversial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian president has spared no poignancy. </seg>
<seg id="6">"We must overcome the transition. </seg>
<seg id="7">And that is my responsibility to the people and to God ," he said in public television. </seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was aimed at all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, Muslims enlightened and secular. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">They all feel hopeless until now in a confused opposition, are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="10">Fear of a theocracy on the shores of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community. </seg>
<seg id="11">As explained Mohammed Mursi, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand their own "to save the revolution." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">It aims to deny its power to the judiciary? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In fact, the 234.2 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamic militants in a nighttime meeting of 15 hours, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the draft also said that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, what does this mean "principles"? </seg>
<seg id="17">This was and remains open to interpretation, and it seems that Islamists are going to take this vague wording, as well as the legal leeway associated with, to impose a more strict interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all matters relating to the Sharija is required to consult the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great power in all Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19">It does not have to be this way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would have as a result of the disablement of the judiciary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What is problematic is also intended to maintain military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="22">During the dictatorship of Mubarak they served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator until 110000 civilians were detained in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="24">As provided for the draft, the state has to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote their moral and their values." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">This is a very vague formulation in legal terms with the help of state institutions this article could even control the content of film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="26">What this is not about anything other than censorship. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In fact that no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="28">Another change prohibits aggrieve or calumniate to the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies. </seg>
<seg id="29">However, it is not clear what is an offence and how it has to be punished. </seg>
<seg id="30">Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits "infringiment persons" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A caricature of the president is sufficient or a joke about a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="32">Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be put to a referendum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution has been." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">Weeks ago that the opposition is lining up against the superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="35">Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir Square in the Cario and vowed to derail the Act before it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists in the presidential elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize and ex-Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft of the constitution should be "in the garbage bucket of history." </seg>
<seg id="38">Through Twitter accused Mursi followers of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy." </seg>
<seg id="39">"When the referendum will go to his palace and derrocaremos," says the opposition Said Jasser. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiada," was quoted in the Egyptian media to political opposition Ali Chaled. </seg>
<seg id="41">And several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, which would not be considered valid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="44">Many women with veiled and supporters of the Salafis took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of divine law." </seg>

<seg id="45">Mursi demanded "clean up the country," at the same time proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution." </seg>
<seg id="46">A fight for the sovereignty of the landmarked Tahrir Square, where it all started, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="47">It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk seeing something happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft of the constitution as supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="49">Now it would be time to let the people decide at the ballot box what direction should follow the country. </seg>
<seg id="50">In this regard, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed a majority. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="54">Not because it share its ideology, but because human rights are indivisible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">That is why he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="56">"And now the term 'Human Rights' even appears in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag." </seg>
<seg id="57">The extension of the powers of Mursi to the three powers of the state made this lawyer resign itself. </seg>
<seg id="58">The measures taken are blatant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="60">However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda is also abandoned by the international community, which is the ideological struggle that is taking place on the shores of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3">It is possible that the success of the country relates to its longing for an extremely smelly fish? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a series of over-worried Curados cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="5">Place them in the middle of a mountain of laundry and wet football. </seg>
<seg id="6">Leave there a week. </seg>
<seg id="7">Then you can smell the crippling aroma of rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="9">It is nevado. The landscape is spectacular and the smell, always-present, fleet in the air. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rakfisk is salting trout that is in ferment over water, depending on how smelly you would prefer, up to a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As clouds and becoming more cold, Norwegians come in droves to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to the delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Eats raw and then drink a glass of aquavit a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a fireman in the city that is also what is known as the "General Rakfisk," which is responsible for organizing the festival. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and sipping a drink large amounts of the drink. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people are more like aquavit rakfisk," says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="15">The drink can kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="16">Pruebo some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid pass near the nose, it is wrong; it is not very different from a piece of sushi that has traveled a few miles on the bus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty in Norway and, before there was refrigeration, the fish are kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels. </seg>
<seg id="19">Later, in winter, when it is already well fermented, removed and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, is eaten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Just a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly emigrated to the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="22">A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and just not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, but rather smelly, of the past in Norway. </seg>
<seg id="24">It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought. </seg>
<seg id="25">But, in fact, everything is expensive; a cane beer or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10 euros ($14) each. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and the majority of Norwegian-owned likes it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">People are still here unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist far-right acribilló shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, they refer to fusillade as "the event of 22 July." </seg>
<seg id="29">It costs a lot to Norwegians believe that in their quiet country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the early '70s, one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason that we are going so well," says Anna, our lunchlady, while moving trays of rakfisk and that, with its long blond hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We are, as you say, prudent people." </seg>
<seg id="33">His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="34">"We do not like boast, we do not like the bling." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">While everyone mismanaged money that he did not have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="38">"And eat rakfisk," she adds with a casual laugh. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am in the snow lining up to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="40">Now a alce hamburger is certainly something different and quite delicious taste. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But at night, makes this smelly fish. </seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel that I stay is one of the many local held a rakfisk dinner in which diners choose the best fish, or perhaps the most tested the nostrils. </seg>
<seg id="43">A television has live-broadcast connected with a presenter wearing crane and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes. </seg>
<seg id="44">It seems the Eurovision contest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Our score is here, Havard." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There is laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls from the chair, perhaps outplayed by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe they are the vapor-handling of all that fish. </seg>

<seg id="8">Mexico has been performing well economic during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country has been plunged into a war against the narcotráfco that has already claimed some billion-$60 lives in six years. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, according attorney-generals </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Prosecutors are trying to address the allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The trial focuses on the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Prosecutors tried to show Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the abuse that now alleges that he suffered while she was under military detention. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted Manning in a preview of the trial in Ft.. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Ashden Commandante Sinn said that the records of weekly visits by officers of the unit that Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interrogation, which was carried out during a hearing conducted following the request of the defence to dismiss the case since his incarceration had been harsh and that it had already made enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought about committing suicide in custody. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The intelligence analyst of the army, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="10">Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="11">Wikileaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At the hearing Friday, Sinn reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled after visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison in Quantico, where he was imprisoned in maximum custody since July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Officers have made questions to Manning and annotated their responses. </seg>
<seg id="14">When Sinn Friday asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to her guards as "excellent" and the treatment received in facilities in general as "very professional." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms show no allegations of abuse, despite the fact that the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment they received, Sinn said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the official who had spoken of these problems and he had indicated that it would be covered, but that they did not recorded these issues in the registry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"They write 'smooth' (after having spoken of the problems), but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment they received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the intentions of suicide that he had expressed in a form months earlier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was. </seg>
<seg id="20">The military said that he had been placed under the restrictive regime, which is a degree below the monitoring for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and safety of other people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted to staff knew that I was well and (wanted) to be under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy that, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," said Manning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located in the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat. </seg>
<seg id="24">He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world just fell to the Arafjon Campamento, the cage-net," explained Manning on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="26">"I thought he was going to die in this cage." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Manning said that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company. </seg>
<seg id="28">Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a chancletas, some clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="29">He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was prohibited sleep or even lying during the day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while he was asleep. </seg>
<seg id="31">He said that if the guards could not see him face when the return was in the evening, he raised to return to turn around. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The lawyer for Manning presented in January 2011 a formal complaint about the treatment of Manning. </seg>
<seg id="33">Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On Friday the judge asked Manning on a plea that he had made in the statement on Thursday, in which, after being forced a night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced during a morning count to stand desdnudo in front of guards and other prisoners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to be covered by the blanket during the recount. </seg>
<seg id="36">During the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said that it was in the order that gave him the governor that he should drop the blanket that could have been filled, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to cease the fall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of an attempt to prove to an official that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="38">Manning said that he had told the officer who could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flop to self-harm, but had not done so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Manning testified that that night had been removed from his cell their underwear, his flip-flop and his glasses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His lawyers have the hope that the judge will at least have in mind the experiences that happened during his stay in prison and drastically reduced his sentence if convicted on the board of war, which is scheduled to start at the beginning of the year to come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense claimed that planned that Manning found guilty of minor crimes and defending other charges considered too extreme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon has argued that Manning was retained in accordance with the rules of application to every detainee under maximum custody in Quantico. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaks of national defense and property theft or public records. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If found guilty of all charges, he could face up to life imprisonment. </seg>

<seg id="1">My identity crisis US-Mexico </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to criticize, says that remind Mexicans of those difficult times </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette said that the mexicano-estadounidenses are caught between two worlds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In a recent trip to Mexico City, barely dropped by the esplanade and reached the claims-processing area of immigration and was already completely confused. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Posters show the way to two lines: one for "Mexican" and another for "foreigners." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I was there a few seconds without being sure where it should go. </seg>
<seg id="8">Having grown up in Central California, throughout my life I have been called "Mexican." </seg>
<seg id="9">This is ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York described themselves "Italian." </seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided to "US-Mexico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="12">And, in the home of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not necessary. </seg>
<seg id="13">It was simply u.s. </seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish sufficiently to manejarme during an interview in this language. </seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and I cannot get rid of my American accent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and I was in the queue of foreigners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought at the time of this week in which the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda of the day, as always to meet the leaders of these two countries, included: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons that at the moment is just as likely that a Mexican remain in Mexico as venture to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and North America to create a trade bloc in the style of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Pena Nieto pledged to continue fighting against the drug cartels in Mexico, but gave no details. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="23">Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of its territory at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that are are everywhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So, at the moment when an official of the United States says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="26">And the sons of Moctezuma are war-footing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that is really a challenge is that they have with more than 35 million mexicano-estadounidenses living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="28">We talk about rancor? </seg>
<seg id="29">There is a lot. </seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for which the country provides and other opportunities for that this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, can the father or mother or any of the grandparents, which was closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="32">And most of the time anyone fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low-level studies,8 from a poor people, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are his descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="34">Mexico does not. </seg>
<seg id="35">And, despite the fact that we are perhaps now living the American dream, to have gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="36">It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty it is. </seg>
<seg id="37">It is for the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class people dislike us. </seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="40">We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat, and we look over the shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not sufficiently mexican. </seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be enough and our ties with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong. </seg>
<seg id="42">In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have been. </seg>
<seg id="44">And now we would not be trapped behind this portiere silk, living well in the United States, but even so, as solitary souls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when he was a girl, reminds me that there is this friction between the Mexican and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first stronger know who they are and the second this bothers them. </seg>
<seg id="46">Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Meanwhile, many mexicano-estadounidenses that I know feel that they are not part of any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="48">We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="49">You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, they see us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we are considered mexican. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, to complicate matters further, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="53">They want the mexicano-estadounidenses work as "ambassadors" of Mexico improvised, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="54">We would say to our fellow Americans fantastic is to visit this country and presionaríamos to political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course... </seg>
<seg id="56">That is not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="57">There is too much resentment. </seg>
<seg id="58">And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="59">I fear that you are going to be alone with this idea, friends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It is fair. </seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico for a century and a half, then have to accept the fact that some mexicano-estadounidenses are still resented how they treated their families less ages ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="63">We are perhaps more "mexican" of what I thought. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There may be some day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="4">Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="5">In the midst of the useless and standingard discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has left everything shattered like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that its deadly deadlock could desencallarse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that neither lost nor wins </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the optimism now seems very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="12">Even if it maintains the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, the clashes this week have strengthened hawks from both sides. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, Affirm have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating. </seg>
<seg id="14">And, despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to do away with Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its ruthless rival Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, the leaders of Hamas could come to the conclusion that the time is playing in his favor. </seg>
<seg id="17">Since the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a re-emergent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Has also made Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="19">The exultant members of Hamas say that the Islamist crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, which dominates the partido-milicia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist could topple Bashar Assad, up to Jordan, where the Hamas allies are threatening the king. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi's in Egypt, by far the most populous and key Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, was not too much time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic action, it is possible that Hamas emerges as protagonist's cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the work-horse wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="25">In the military issue, have put Hamas in their place. </seg>
<seg id="26">The anti-missile system of Iron Dome of Israel has proved its effectiveness and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis will sleep easier... for some time. </seg>
<seg id="28">When it comes to diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets fired from Gaza have claimed the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part due to the barrier that dissolves West Bank, the main piece of a wannabe territory to become state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that are still rising despite that, under international law, are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of an even more tough line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the runup to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil these twisted Palestinians by giving them a separate state? </seg>
<seg id="33">If we really govern West Bank, it would be shot rockets as they have done their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if lifting the head. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the tough wing is imposed, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations. </seg>
<seg id="36">Although the Islamists take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation to Israel, its priority will be to address the internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="37">The defence budget of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="38">Starting a war with the super-Power in the area is hardly likely to the new Arab governments to improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatic Mr. Morsi's has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire augurs well and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should think long term. </seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination creating ammunition-dump that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="42">The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsens the situation as it increases the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The solution remains the touting sensible people from both sides, most of the outside world, and this newspaper: two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="46">The hope, small short-term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of arms in Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="49">That would be more conducive to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Obama also has an important role in bring about Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term failed to present its own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="52">Back in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to spend their attention. </seg>
<seg id="53">This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future. </seg>
<seg id="54">A Middle East stable is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="55">This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. </seg>

<seg id="5">This is the most strict-regime of the world applied to the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian federal government says that the goal is to deter youth smoking by removing the traits that make this habit has glamour. </seg>
<seg id="7">He hoped that studies show that if a person has not started smoking before 26 years, there is a 99% chance that never do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said the federal health minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls relate the logo of a wreath with the idea of being a princess. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world, and that these changes will not greatly affect the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar action. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies said that the law would promote the black market for tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="12">"The law will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco, in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="13">It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other people say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law. </seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for pitilleras and covered sillicone to plug the unpleasant images of the packets had been fired almost from scratch for two months, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="16">Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold to PhP6,000 units wholesale and waiting for more stocks. </seg>
<seg id="17">"It is a good business for us." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networking between the demographic sector that the plan is directed. </seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, the marketing of tobacco has come to be conducted online. </seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and web pages, but it cannot restrict it in foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="21">"If comercializas tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be," said Becky Freeman, researcher of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman noted an increase of profiles on lables from "ordinary citizens" published in websites of social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="23">One wonders whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any marketing company is behind all this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that the industry is more about implying the new regulations in the marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recused themselves of the new rules; these countries are saying to the World Organization of Trade is restricting trade unfairly, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant trade volume with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="26">It is likely that the WTO will pass a resolution in 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the year 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images in the packets. </seg>
<seg id="29"> They are now mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="30">In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering applying tougher laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In Australia, many smokers are defiant. </seg>
<seg id="32">"The photographs do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="33">Simply not I." </seg>
<seg id="34">"You take smoke and guardas the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="35">"Honestly, there is only one reason that it would stop smoking: for my daughter." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, manager of the tobacco shop King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform packets make it more complicated place them on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="37">"Normally it could take an hour to desenvalar a delivery; now takes me four," says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="38">"The government should have completely banned smoking and then, it is already, it is, ran out and closed the shop," says while closed hands up. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad a little bored </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the festivities of the day of Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait to see another plane. </seg>
<seg id="3">So I had a lot of time to think about the tediousness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="5">Spend half day at an airport awaiting a flight is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting duty-free shops. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But there are more and more scholars and experts in child development that praise the virtues of the tediousness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we aburramos from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="8">Bored requires the brain to look for interesting options and can promote creativity. </seg>
<seg id="9">Given that, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experienced the benefits tediousness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So, we should accept good spirits the tediousness? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes. </seg>
<seg id="12">And not. </seg>
<seg id="13">But now we can talk about that later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">First, like many people, meant that, now that we have more time for leisure, the tediousness would be a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="15">But, as says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A History Lively" ("the tediousness, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, this is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, the history of the tediousness is very extensive," he said. </seg>
<seg id="17">The walls of Pompeya exist in Latin graffitis on the tediousness dating from the first century AD </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We must also consider how we define the tediousness. </seg>
<seg id="19">"The problem is that has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After examining the published research and raise the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues identified the tediousness as the experience of "desirable, but not be able to participate in an activity that fills you." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do so. </seg>
<seg id="22">He points out that apathy is not a desire to do something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main experience of the tediousness, he says, is "the alteration of the process of care, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The tediousness may sound terribly similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, the people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem with them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we believe that we are boring, when what is happening to us in reality is that we have to concentrate problems. </seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to an earlier experiment in which the participants heard a tape of a person who read the article in a magazine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard in the adjoining room a television programme to all volume unconnected, others heard with the low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard the audio at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The group heard the program with the low volume showed more tediousness than the other two groups; it took focus, but they were not sure why, and attributed to the tediousness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"When you are trying to refocus on a difficult task or interesting, the disruption of care can lead to the tediousness," said Mark J. Fenske, Neurociencia professor at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a line of manufacturing, a music that distracted you can help not aburrirte." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"In fact, we now know that move or make garbage, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help fight it, because it makes that person is physically more alert." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The research shows that those children who are allowed move learn more and have more information than those that they are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all know what is bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film. </seg>
<seg id="35">But some people tend to get bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="36">To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of the tediousness trend." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes "many of the things that I have to do is repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I have no time to do it all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that is bored quite easily. </seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human development and communaitare of the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which was put in contact with 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search. </seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of adolescents said that aburría while at school or doing the duties, while 23 percent said that aburría when he was not in school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3% of parents said that you were bored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know whether the tediousness percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="44">But he said that what we knew was that "adolescence is a period in which the tediousness reaches its highest levels," in large part because both children and adolescents are not given a great control over what they want to do. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, returning to my question of principle: it is good bored? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes, it is not what led to the extreme, can do expose us to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as shown by the research. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"The tediousness is the way that has the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know what is more appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cooking, that will satisfy you. </seg>
<seg id="51">But if you see the television, it is possible that you meet short-term, but not in the long term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">"So, if your child is boring and you have an iPad, it is possible that no longer become bored, but has not learned to chew itself or dosificarse," says Professor Fenske. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "ANPPCAN dosificarse applies to other situations," he says. </seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only to chew alone, but learn to be better controlled in other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think we really want to praise the tediousness. </seg>
<seg id="56">But we should not be too critical of him. </seg>
<seg id="57">Our goal should be, rather, find comfort away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"In our view, we need more aburrirnos, but the tediousness is a very distressing and disturbing desire to relate it to something worth," he said. </seg>
<seg id="60">He points out that what people really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a time-out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops." </seg>

<seg id="1">Colorado: without instructions for the new law on the use of marijuana </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer in the southeast of Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of stones of marijuana and a pipe used to fumarla. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends led by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when it stopped the police. </seg>
<seg id="4">Police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related articles (Minor-Offence each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which she was informed of the date of the trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are treated as criminals," says Orozco. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And they are? </seg>
<seg id="7">In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalization of possession of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor cases for possession of drugs is less dependent on the law of the location. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of Minor-Offence for possession of marijuana are tearing up both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was approved. </seg>
<seg id="9">Police departments have ceased to bring charges against the biggest -year-old for small-scale possession, which will be adopted legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in more conservative districts of Colorado have committed themselves to pursue cases for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people. </seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of marijuana stores, recently authorized, in their communities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Those who are responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington are also dwelling on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="14">And continue to seek advice to establish a licensing system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline, on 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="15">They say that, for good or bad, Colorado is ahead of most of the states in terms of the regulation of the use of marijuana, first for terapeúticos and now for recreational use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Commission on alcohol control of the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work. </seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent that we serve as a model," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, known as I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which nadará between two waters, as the licensing system in this state does not yet exist, but the possession is legal. </seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, there are some mechanical sensitive issues that must be resolved during that period, as a way to maintain a balance between the demands of the state to provide an "adequate access" to the authorized marijuana and its ban on conducting business of cannabis in a radius less than 300 meters of schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Nowhere will be more difficult to locate a business of authorized cannabis in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Center for legal cannabis, a research group recently created. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, Oates, the police chief of Aurora, sent an Email to its police officers informing them that the prosecutor of the city would no longer prosecute misdemeanors for possession of marijuana for people over the age of 21 years and that the police would cease to bring charges against these crimes "with immediate effect." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcement of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the county of Weld, in the north of Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, assured that his office would continue pursuing cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="26">Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has the obligation to prosecute those who minor-offence at the time that occurred were crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer serves adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="30">Pete Hautzinger, prosecutor in the district of the county, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding cases for possession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not believe that it is losing time to continue enforcing the law until it changes," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered to carry the use of marijuana for recreational use by the government and the judicial system would be easy. </seg>
<seg id="33">The contradictory reactions that arise around the state show a strong ambivalence among officials on the great environmental experiment in this state. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"It is a cultural barrier with prosecutors in the district," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana and is local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have spent so much time taking people to the courts that, in fact, still cannot accept that it is legal," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states that consider small quantities of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the test cases at the national level in terms of the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="37">While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also anxiously awaiting indications from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will relent. </seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the fact that there have been some high-profile arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed mostly for business selling marijuana with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"Although it is likely that the agents do not throw counternarcotics down doors to confiscate a bag of small drugs, probably would be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor political counternarcotics of the Obama administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities in Colorado are not expected to act federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the day of the elections, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them can open. </seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve the following week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorise someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the ayuntamiento. </seg>
<seg id="45">"Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="46">We are studying in favour of what voted the community up to vote in favour of what voted the state." </seg>
<seg id="47">There are many questions. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">I do not remember any time in my life that has not been dreaming in getting a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had been that I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek sSymposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: the free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, the two weeks of taking my place in the Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to pursue the career of history, had already made the luggage, which triggered the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed and started crying. </seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper The Evening Standard said that I had left because it does not tolerate that some university colleagues keep sex in the room next door. </seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A.N. Wilson announced kiddin ' that I had gone because I had to drink desconchadas cups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less fun. </seg>
<seg id="11">Huí there. </seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, huí, because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my extravagant name, nor the fact that it was a private school. </seg>
<seg id="14">I harassed by a single reason, in the cradle of the alleged enlightenment was somewhat intolerant and barbarious: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You might ask why that now. </seg>
<seg id="16">Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering from a similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="17">The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford, which last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights of homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the JCR (Gruping grade) of the Corpus Christi College say that they are "often seriously subarticles, personally attacked and treated as undesirables" for their political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="19">They want to create a seat on the committee of equal opportunities for their college to make sure to express their views freely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (" paradise: young, bright and right-wing) on the policy of the students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi. </seg>
<seg id="21">Shewed to graduate student Joe Cooke, former head of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silvery dress and a stick with the grip of silver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "scapegoats" by the introduction of higher tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing trend left in universities. </seg>
<seg id="24">People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know us." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a student of history in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old and elected president of the OUCA, says that the attitude of the members of the JCR to the people who are center-right has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="26">"This is a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of members," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During my first weeks in Oxford I was more single. </seg>
<seg id="28">I entered the university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old terribly timid. </seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point. </seg>
<seg id="30">The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after the cuts in the financing of Higher Education. </seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have been horrifying frightfully to any Stalinist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university, when the new students are known and known to the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that the professors not only ignored the derision that the university was conservative, but that they were involved in it willingly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar. </seg>
<seg id="35">The first I attended should be translated into English French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what followed. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said agrege Harry Pitt (late), "please outpour the first paragraph." </seg>
<seg id="37">I do not. </seg>

<seg id="44">That night I sat alone at the time of the dinner at the university; then I felt a slight pat on the back. </seg>
<seg id="45">It was a second year English student named James that was presented as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he told me kindly. </seg>
<seg id="47">"I fear that this is the way it was going. </seg>
<seg id="48">They pick with anyone who is suspected of being Tory. </seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="50">Many newcomers Tories appear to be Labour." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in a local pub, I tried dissemble like a coward. </seg>
<seg id="52">I stressed that he did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said. </seg>
<seg id="53">That trick was useless. </seg>
<seg id="54">A first-year student of Phylosophy, Policy and Economics that, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "Erres daughter of a fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="55">You are contaminated." </seg>
<seg id="56">Other students took this ditty. </seg>
<seg id="57">I became the dirty perverted. </seg>
<seg id="58">"How have sex the Tories?" asked one. </seg>
<seg id="59">"Give a beating one another, not?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt the same way that homosexuals should have been before the liberal law of the 1960s. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="65">The only openly Tory agrege was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History aimed at my college. </seg>
<seg id="66">They hated him for being not only of the Conservative Party, but also an adviser to Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote him their speeches. </seg>
<seg id="67">I was just there. </seg>
<seg id="68">He detested the place I thought that it was parochial and insignificant and for his adherence to the marxista-determinista vision of history. </seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 accepted a chair at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you're not going to be happy," he told me. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of more open metropolitan mentality. </seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father who hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="73">I do not believe it. </seg>
<seg id="74">When he studied there in the 1940s, he accepted all political views. </seg>
<seg id="75">"But if it is the best place in the world," he said with sadness. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="4">The designer has acknowledged during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of the couture," a tremendous retrospective that gathers more than 130 haute couture dresses created by its "maison" over the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="5">"I love this palace," says with its distinctive Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="6">This sample is the culmination of a story whose protagonist is "Il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without their distinguished clients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino has always been fascinated by the tense and distant world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="8">In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next March-3, there are private letters and photos with the signing of the " buttonhole ' of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, from Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="9">Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of their social ascent: humble modisto of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, idol of the international "jet-set." </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="11">"At least they do not turn off the butts of their pitillos on your magnificient carpet as they do some beautiful celebs pop music," says the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="12">In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="13">Valentino is a spectacular host and entertainment too with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="14">"All of us loved to be invited to his villa in Gstaad," explains the "exmujer" Thyssen, Heini intimate beauty forgotten as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>

<seg id="16">And yet, it is a star. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also forgets the charism of the modisto. </seg>
<seg id="19">For many years, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="20">We were 20 people, including those who were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="21">In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, was and felt in all its spirit. </seg>
<seg id="22">"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began to work with him during the week of haute couture in Paris, in 1995. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Garavani life is not a story of obsessions, but love responded well. </seg>
<seg id="26">He loves the people with good education and better titles, and they love him to him. </seg>
<seg id="27">One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamurosa smarthost 60 meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and is visited by the smarthost to contemplate a dream "hearing" that wears masterpieces of Valentino, as the raiment chose Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, ready-made-garment Monica used in Vitti "La Notte," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget." </seg>
<seg id="31">I remember it well. </seg>
<seg id="32">It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket of the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection. </seg>
<seg id="33">"It was a gift that I did it," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer. </seg>
<seg id="34">"I prefer him above others for their femininity, for his great love for women, because it amplifies our beauty," adds the former Duchess of VSK. </seg>
<seg id="35">I like a lot the colors used, are very light and are "donors" in the face. </seg>
<seg id="36">The proportions are perfect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The princess and prescriptora must-go Patricia d'en Giovampaola della Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time that he adorned a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="38">When I was teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed to come to the age and the opportunity to use one of their costumes night... </seg>
<seg id="39">Finally it came to the end of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="40">I bought my first Valentino dress to use at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="41">It was a red suit, with skirt blown, "corsage" drapeado and escote word of honour. </seg>
<seg id="42">"It was a dream," says the widow of champion Rodrígo Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="44">Princess D'Oro fosterage Arenberg their party dresses modisto with "investment-ceiling care... because a dress is not only a raiment, it is also the set of memories that entails." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress in her wedding with Pablo's of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="47">It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (such as the Pyre modisto to his seamstresses) to develop the silk gingham dress with ivory inlaid pearls, twelve lacework different types and a queue of four meters and a half. </seg>
<seg id="48">According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, head of the specialist press, that raiment represents a milestone in the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Which is obsessed for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is the best example. </seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest oficio in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano put the life and health while carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur through precipitous stone trails </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people that their work is a hell and one that literally works in hell. </seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case of Amto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="5">To that end, you have to come down every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth is solidified to enter into contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="6">After bootable boulders of sulphur, which in total came despite some 70 kilograms, carries in two bamboo baskets that burden on their shoulders through rugged stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="7">They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to reach snail's pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps careful not to resbalarse and fall on the precipice. </seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any blunder could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist despeñó years ago by the riscos of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Kawah miners-gold Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur extracted </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once above, are appearing among the tourists who photograph as if they were circus monkeys, and fatigosamente carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has placed slightly below 1.85 meters. </seg>
<seg id="11">This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that exploits since 1960 the volcano, and never better, their workers, who pays 662 IDR (euro cents 5) for every kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="12">Then sold for -10000 rupees (83 cents euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this minerally is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder sugar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As typically carry 70 kilograms, we drew 46000 rupees (3.8 euros) in each trip," explains Amto, who often make three daily postage. </seg>
<seg id="14">It takes three hours in each and just milled, but allow it to save 138000 rupiahs ($11,500,000 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems a pittance for inhumane effort, is triple what he would win in the field. </seg>
<seg id="16">"The salary of miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid to 15000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros) ," clarifies the carrier, which previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was 75000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the coalface was not so hard, but Amto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason that, in Indonesia, it is now such as sulphur: "I got married with a young woman in Bali, where Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert to Islam." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Amto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, and coughs constantly irritate the eyes by toxic gases </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years, Amto has three playing the skins in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass bill despite wearing the face with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, breathing with difficulty, and he coughs constantly irritate the eyes of the toxic gases that fires the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="21">It is the price we must pay to achieve their dream. </seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or studying Spanish or French," promises a more acceptable English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished for life, this young man and intelligent could be tourist guide, waiter or recepcionista of a hotel, but instead of that makes the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, each day rose to two in the morning because the sulphur is manar night, when its distinctive yellow becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness. </seg>
<seg id="25">Defying the shadows, Amto down to the alumbrándose crater with a small flashlight affixed to his helmet, which he has bought with their money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some 400 porters loaded baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or provide any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and to both the weight. </seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, even are part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge camera, along with the entry of 15000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guardas of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," Madrusin Outcry, a burly 42-year-old carrier that has been in the Kawah Ijen three decades since leaving the school. </seg>
<seg id="30">Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, ensures that aguantará work "everything that can" because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I do not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulfur burns the throat and rankles the eyes when the wind changes unexpectedly and catch miners in the thick columns emerging from the volcano, are so hard that none complained of serious illness... beyond is, of course, their usual respiratory problems, artrosis, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformado by the weight of the baskets'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balanceando the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilograms to his 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his colleagues started 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari almacén, 18 kilometers away from a path of goats in the bush. </seg>
<seg id="35">"I don't retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik well by opening the mouth, where he was missing several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="36">Their five children, the largest of 30 years, also works with sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but the misery of perpetuating intergenerationally one of the toughest skill-training in the world: making the human mules of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">It may seem implausible that these aayaat are part of an announcement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "we are going to put a bathroom (roll) in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that the announcement will draw attention to the problem of a fun way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people comply with their "national duty." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This is something purely internet, so we had to do it funny and funny. </seg>
<seg id="10">It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we had to address. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing veiled go-fast citations (speed-dating). </seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="14">So we think, why are we not doing more creative as possible to solve this problem, which is putting together a rap? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That is not taken so lightly is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="17">Spends US$1.3 annually on policies to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A government package for married couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity and load-balanced tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="22">The last time that was over 2 - known as replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="24">As Wei Mings, Director of Policy Marriage and Family of the National Population Division, said that is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and form a family," he explains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in unmarried, and to delay marriage and birth, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy that tip to drastically increase immigration to confront the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are websites rife with barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical to maintain the low wages and not integrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the party of government in Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="30">Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government tries to not be built so many maisonettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoebox," which can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and successful sales. </seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of unmarried and discourage developers who want to build large houses, family. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company El Developers, said that its "shoeboxes" are sold much faster than the larger units. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="40">This makes it much better for our cash flow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who are before appointments,1 hurdles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too distressed </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of downtown it seems that they are not going to have much effect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, and so is education, so many people are putting off," says a young executive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mentioned their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are those who have the last word. </seg>

<seg id="7">ElPeriódico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="8">In four cases, the associated with "something very mine," personally, and "in the key and user name," when applied to social networks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My deepest secrets would rise not to a post," says Jorge, ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of private sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has accounts for two years. </seg>
<seg id="10">"They are very secret, my mom can know them, but not all over the world," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In FB get beautiful pictures or games. </seg>
<seg id="12">I also entretengo with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="13">"Do not share a picture that is not mine, or someone who is doing the ridiculous," he says. </seg>
<seg id="14">The child recognizes that it is wrong for publishing obscene photographs, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge claims to know the 35 friends who are in FB and his nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="16">Most are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="17">The mother is included, is the key to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="18">I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="19">"I don't know if I am told, I just get," he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly," he said. </seg>
<seg id="21">No doubt counter-argued that I would never accept a request for an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="22">Nor would someone who would recommend to a stranger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of Joses, 14 years, is different. </seg>
<seg id="24">The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, Reteng admits not knowing 20 people added in their list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="25">"I am not afraid, because we have something in common, music for example," says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">According to the boy, none has been suggested to him or asked the direction of your home or your telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="27">"If I put pressure or simply satchel I warranted my account," acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="28">Joses became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The boy did not extraneous the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying. </seg>

<seg id="38">"Although I know that this is ciberbullying," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Questions Clave </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, English teacher and a bachelor's degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to report. </seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites changed the rules of the game," mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras noted that the academic Marc Prensky, master's degree in education from the University of Yale and author of the book Native and Digital Inmigrantes, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives are children and young people who were born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="44">"We are digital-based immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He said that the issue is complex, "because we are calling for them to have a definite view on what should or should not be spread, publish or say at an age that maturity is not for that." </seg>
<seg id="46">"Also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions to reflect. </seg>
<seg id="48">"To say that it will not do so there is no point," he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then, Porras lists some options: there are things that you contarías to a stranger, why you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="50">Or, you would like to publish a photo of you as you published a friend? </seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the other published on you? </seg>
<seg id="52">When tags' photos of house-parties, pediste permission from the other people to label them? </seg>
<seg id="53">And more, all need to know what you're doing every moment? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is telling them that they must act online as they do off line. </seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="56">"One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, like should be in the social networks," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Survelliance </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guard, university professor, professor of primary and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents to read conciousness policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="59">To understand each Subparas they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, the age and what is permitted share or publish," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Guard, it is important to remember the children the lesson of "don't talk with strangers." </seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The presidential Sixth Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without issued the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven mandate--holders assistants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Efe tried to repeatedly access to the document signed in the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry and presidency sources said initially that they were going to surrender after the closure, but later said that at some point will be posted on the website of the Peruvian Government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">To be consulted by the text, pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="5">Journalists access to information from the summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During the day only tansmitted, in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio." </seg>
<seg id="7">The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the event, though not the peruvian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The only document released during the day was the list of chairpersons' assistants, resulting in the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for greater data. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an Email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Last October, Peru was the host of the IIIMPIII America Summit of the Arab Sur-Países (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite being repeatedly required by the press, it was not the so-called Lima Declaration that had previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="11">The official website of ASPA can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In both international events, the Peruvian authorities scrambled to have insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited to the maximum obtaining information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Court of The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and reaffirmed that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear arguments from both sides, in the process that Lima filed against santiago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"Abide by and carry out the sentence that defines the differences that today we are taking this international court," said Humala, along with his chilean keypair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added Piñero, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The confirmation of the two presidents will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá for which it had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundary with Nicaragua was seriously wrong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The summit was held with the inasistencias of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="19">Paraguay, suspended Unasur from 2011 following the dismissal of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="21">The president read the final document in which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and set lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="22">Among the agreements mentioned that the UNASUR's countries will give "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending agreements on residence." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He reported that promote actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against public insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make acessible drugs, access to Internet at low prices in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently meet the risks of natural disasters." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latinamerica) should not have a triumphalist matrix, but should serve to expand productive nustra matrix and see a better future for our peoples," added Humala. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We have decided to promote a group of 31 emblematical projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of America in the South, especially in rural areas and border... uniting our countries and generating new economic roundtrips," said the Peruvian president in a message read. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are located in the cross-cutting issues of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In addition, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="28">"We hope that the electoral process in that country will return to the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The need for Latinamerica is maintained as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional event that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal in a way that respects the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotà. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="32">"We are going to review all of these roads, are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"With the president Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos. </seg>

<seg id="1">"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case it must learn from Europe." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV peru that Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In that sense, defended the project to establish suramericana citizenship that encourage the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="5">"We have to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as are members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past," he warned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Ecuadorian president, moreover, was in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those who give " catedra never commit to anything and, instead, we Americans signed everything. </seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correra assured that it is not repented of this decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but it has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights." </seg>
<seg id="10">He added that, at the time, "there were suspicions that Assange be extradited to a third country, and its process was not respected." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice demand being on its territory to the interrogation by an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation can do it by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correra said that there is a risk that the physical and mental health deteriorates Assange. </seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken to him since it is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">There is the danger that their physical and mental health deteriorates because he was locked up in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="15">"That complicates the health of any person," he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correra pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto to allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the encierro of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We don't negotiate with human rights, we do not use the word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzon, is making a series of procedures in different European institutions," he mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And he said that "if Britain gives tomorrow the pass this has been." </seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as well as allows its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogating Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype tomorrow has been this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correra used to assert itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and emphasized that what does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which undermine the freedom of expression." </seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and wicked politicians, but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this respect welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer "neither bankers nor the hegemons and bohemians that dominate Ecuador," and he added that his re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correra also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next election, to argue that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coups d'etat been of legality" because in reality "shattered the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Ecuadorian president, moreover, considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the moment is not complied with that ruling. </seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country. </seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="29">We must comprehensively try to overcome them and move forward. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that are in the same court Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latinamerica to seek international bodies if the two countries are committed to accept tough judgment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In reference to the possibility that is presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term pointed out that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, but sometimes it is quite hard." </seg>
<seg id="32">Correra said that if it loses the elections in February 2013 will be removed from public life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The staff has never interested me the power, but in such unjust situations such as this Équateur socio-economic poverty it can only be corrected from political power. </seg>
<seg id="34">"My pólitico movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, because we have to accept that reponsabilidad," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Winning would be my last term in the presidency and hence salimos of public life. </seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose the same. </seg>
<seg id="37">"It's a decision," he said. </seg>
<seg id="38">Correra also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have just spoken with the Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and I said that went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which is expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="40">"Does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The head of State today participated in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security. </seg>

<seg id="1">Deaths from AIDS are now due to late detection </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive. </seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if I was a bomb," remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to do "more suavecito," without apparent success. </seg>
<seg id="4">The boy hid his family. </seg>
<seg id="5">He decided only to take his illness and began to learn about it; with such festejó his 36-43 birthday. </seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with the virus of HIV/AIDS from 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="8">Then, until the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided bid farewell "because she was bringing a cut." </seg>
<seg id="9">Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignorant of his illness, still many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" your immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts timely treatment, and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infectólogo and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since the year 2008, the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that are patients to begin the diagnosis, with better anticipation for those who are not users of drugs: up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years, when CD4 reported 500. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In simple terms, this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive in the 25 years of age, under these terms "while keeping in control can live without problems until 75 years," explained the interviewee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to evaluate this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS declined from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died. </seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and are $187.0 deaths until May this year; however ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why there are still deaths? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="20">Visualizo, this happened to us in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years we have had no desabasto medication the problem is that patients are very advanced because they did not know their state of infection, or in late stages of the disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He gave a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection that has to be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to do more diagnosis and, therefore, have to offer screening massively, to all the people who require." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also patient, as Fabrizio, who went to be tested in a particular laboratory, motivated only because they had made a friend and, despite their young age, was already in stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumour that is one of the common complications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="25">Some people think that are going to die and do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="26">"If I am going to die, I better reviento three times a week," but not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="27">The change was to improve, I good food, I exercise, take medications. </seg>
<seg id="28">To date, their parents only know that it had suffered cancer. </seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, as anyone. </seg>
<seg id="30">"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but Gabi, I am cautious, to me and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate their testimony to those who today, in the context of the World Day of AIDS, they are afraid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Take the test, if they had risk, quickly know if they are HIV-positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, to learn that they can live as any person, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="32">That, his message, sums up the slogan of battle AIDS this 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">After the comptoir condoms </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Big are the gaps that exist between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salalar, tapatío journalist who has taken the case around HIV. </seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="36">In the places devoted to this task "has effectively increased the distribution of condoms, given before one or two, we now give packages to 100, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said. </seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What do you want?" is common question, with derision and value-judgements of social workers, school counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, to which they do not want to expose teenagers, said the communicator. </seg>
<seg id="39">He proposed redirecting this ineffective re-partition; that condoms are not only after the comptoirs and those 100 are in bathhouse dispatchers of sites that frequenters young people. </seg>
<seg id="40">It is not motivate promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="41">Neither is paying chelas and the motel, as did the governor Emilio Gonzalez, to ask whether there would be distribution of condoms in his administration. </seg>
<seg id="42">"Sexuality is not the case, it's best to bring condoms to those already engaging in sexual activity," he said. </seg>

<seg id="1">Ratified by a US appeals court ruling that ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a harmful precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It would seem, therefore, that the procedures in co-signers survival of firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, in defiance of international conventions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In practical terms, the boost to the ruling issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas, is helpless to Mexican firms against the possibility of seizure of their properties across the Bravo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing three inconsistencies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Entry, while the judge in the case noted that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Law, the appeals court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, said that the main procedure is the commercial competition processed in Mexico. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would ignore the procedural-law international cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with international profile. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, to this end was created the Model Law of the United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Trade Law, placing themselves as an arbitrator the American Law Institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the ruling says that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of the quizz commercial debts that they had with its parent subsidiaries of Vitro, it had not achieved the majority required to approve the restructuring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the possibility recognize the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, the Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted. </seg>
<seg id="11">There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debt was endorsed by the Federal Institute for Business Competitions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The truth is, moreover, subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway creditors Vitro who battled in the courts of the United States, namely the "vulture" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergência, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, there will be no majority. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have been 45 percent against 37. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The data omits the Court of Appeal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another angle, Vitro fault of the difficult situation faced from 2008 to circumvention of the severe economic crisis facing the United States, to beat him coletazos in the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So far, the signing of the family Gonz Sa'da must submit a review before the court of appeal itself to ensure that the vote reaches the full, namely the five-Member, given that only three voted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">If it does not reclaim the use of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a higher-instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The serious case is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which detailed the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law on Business Competitions, pointing out that this case involving adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Bancarrotas Act of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Moreover, it was noted that the country joined the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for cross-border cases of insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="1">Hector Reyes "Hetin": "Basketball has been my life." </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Basketball globe-trotting Hector Reyes "Hetin" was more than 60 years linked to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he traveled the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as is Hector reyes "Hetin." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And it is that before a stroke confinara to a wheelchair in 2008, reyes was immersed in sport for more than 60 years, was as player of minor categories, player of the Higher National Basketball, agent and leader in the BSN with Vaqueros Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I wore many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," recalled reyes during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Elizabeth, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball has been my life." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes no exaggeration to make that assertion. </seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias showing their eminence, this is reflected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In-heart Bayamón </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of all, which brings more emotion are heard its passage through the Vaqueros since the middle of the decade of the 50 as player until 1982, when he turned 15 years serving as coapoderado or possession of the franchise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"These were my best years, which I enjoyed more because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, either as attorney, coapoderado or leader. </seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of gratifications, including the five consecutive championships since 1971 until 1975. </seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of debut Jerôme Mincy in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="14">Thereafter he became "Cuco" ORTIZ, who was a great manager ," said reyes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Gene Bartow, who had led here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "Do you have a good strong player, 6" 7 " stature. </seg>
<seg id="16">What do you want? " </seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players who has been Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help to bring another more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Vaqueros championship with Gausse enjoyed, but already in the distance, as in 1988 was federal supremo. </seg>
<seg id="21">By that time he preferred to enjoy their records and Mincy in the National Team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when I won for the first time in the United States during the Preolímpico in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World in 1990, where we came fourth and should have been bronze not be at the Canadian referee that made us repeat the final game for the second time, said reyes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This group of the World 1990 is the best National Team you've seen? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">He is among the best, as he won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we peel off the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that we won the bronze in the world. </seg>
<seg id="27">That team was repeating not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lpez and "Piculín" (ORTIZ), but also had to (JAvier) "Tonito" Colón. and James Carter youth, the brothers LEÓN (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in 90 due to a knee injury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Preolímpico of the 1995 Neuquén., Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="29">With role players as "Canito" snows', Pablo's Alicea and a Youthful Rolando Hourruitiner instead of the players suspended by the mess of the Pan American Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What has been the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without any doubt, this has been Piculín ORTIZ. </seg>
<seg id="32">Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="34">And that without his career in the different leagues that played. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who has been the best Sagardia leader? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="37">We have had a very good boat that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="38">Young people, I love the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Having been part of the most glorious of the National Team between 1988 and 1995, and early 1990's BSN had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What you got to do? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things that wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="43">For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="44">Right now children travel and play too unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the fruit of the compulsorias and surfcourse certifications for leaders, official table and referees. </seg>
<seg id="46">I welcome that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing now? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most is music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme to my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This semester, when the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, knew that it had an irresistible fishhook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have been hung as proof that it is the end of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Charmé had no idea what is expected in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where the theoretical Christians from the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"No, I realized that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester-long that there has been," said Charmé this week to students from Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="6">If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that bad is good for those apocalyptic mentality. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of the story. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="9">In Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker conducting the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world." </seg>
<seg id="10">Each week, students are exploring apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We look at why these ideas are rife with time," he said, and the manner in which offer scenarios that guide some human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="12">If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, could ignite a war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how compared with examples of real life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Associate Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made team to provide a course, only entitled "the end of the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Not add '2012' to always have the option of course again, in the event that the world will not end," said Restall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "imminent ruin," students should study, generate projects and take final exams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no students choice other than work "until the same night in which the world is supposed to end," said Restall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses were quite popular. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In two hours were "saturó," said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="21">We received e-mails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, people who asked if there was still place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"I find it fascinating to see what they do individuals to console themselves themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion and Sociologic 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="24">And it is the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is only matter of comfort or the absence of the same. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">Will. Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, 25 years, said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>

<seg id="26">"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said. </seg>
<seg id="27">I enjoy it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said believe in the expiration date of 21 December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project focused on the Mayan prophecy and somewhat desacreditamos," said Julie Zeglen, a student of last year in Temple, -year-old and West Chester. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But reserved that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has caused a boom of such speculation. </seg>
