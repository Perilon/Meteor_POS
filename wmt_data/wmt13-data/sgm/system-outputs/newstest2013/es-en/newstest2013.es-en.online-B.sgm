<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to hinder Obama 's reelection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat voter fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, the Brennan Center latter considered a myth and claims that voter fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people dying due to a lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, Republican lawyers have found more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the U.S. in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">In that sense, these measures partly undermine the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Contrary to what happens in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in that same line a majority of the American governments enacted, from 2009, new laws that hindered the registration process or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republicans in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently, in 2011 introduced 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require that voters present identification with a photograph, and a U.S. citizenship test.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register to vote in the election day and removed their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, no American state demanded that voters present a photo identification document.</seg>
<seg id="14">The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore, the republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to show a valid photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identification, such as Social Security card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification issued by a government agency in your state.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack identification with those characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="21">But often, obtaining required identification costs over a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Whereupon, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than$ 35,000 per year, 18% of citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years do not have a valid photo identification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And there's more.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students in many states, most voters vote for Democratic candidates, can not use the photo identification issued by your institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, these same states authorize members of fishing clubs or hunting that usually vote Republican parties use documents issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures seek to clearly limit the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 legislation abolishing certain voter registration on the day of polling in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who would enroll.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, in the 2004 general elections, the registration drives to register voters contributed about 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of enrollment of new voters fell in 2010 compared with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction of early voting period.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African American, while the latter represented only 13% of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the case of Hispanics was exactly the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">These represent only 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">However, the white, representing 76% of the electorate, they represent only 46% of citizens who vote in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">In this sense, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">The prosecution in the United States intervened to suspend the controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">It could, in part, to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics denounce the partisan Democrats of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A Brennan Center report 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It's too early to say with certainty whether these legislative amendments scale electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">One thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this regard, measures partly undermine the American democratic system.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Prostate Cancer Screening : Become the test or not let them?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the PSA test has sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, after which it was decided unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a reason enough to make men doubt as reticent in itself, should be whether or not screening tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">To become a test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked two experts for advice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the United States is a great index detected infection among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had realized the detection and those without.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study, with the track 12, also demonstrated that between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastasis was not performed if the screening test.</seg>
<seg id="9">I recommend, therefore, the test from age 50, or after 40 years if your father has had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">African American men have a higher risk rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to make a good decision once detected cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is it really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. You must provide all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not conflict with long-term life, in which case you should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today many men that have been detected are not treated cancer because the cancer is not aggressive and pose a risk to your life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer a treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Determined frequency increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I recommend that you take the test anyway.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to talk with your doctor about whether you should take the test or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Preventing disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic formula to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles are still the best way to reduce risk for the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, they could prevent 30% of cancers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one smoked, the rate would rise at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many others remain totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Cancer Society, the tobacco control remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The snuff is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also constitutes a risk factor for other cancers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Greatly harms people 's health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">One encouraging fact : 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">feeding</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The agency further recommended limiting consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In large quantities, they scale the risk for colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">The deli products should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may cause the formation of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">"They can damage body cells and lead to cancer development," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, scientists have studied the links between multivitamins and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, by the time their investigations are inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">SCC Segou, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While one of them was observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another it was observed, instead, an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D in cancer has not been determined clearly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Moreover, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of everyone with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Do the test does not cause cancer detection."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson generated a stir last summer, and rightly so.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed, in fact, that the Higgs is a participant in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.</seg>
<seg id="4">And what is more, it is the particle whose existence is predicted Standard Model : our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for physicists is not entirely clear that the case of Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a doubt that there is a new particle that resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data unveiled this week in a major physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, but there are still more data to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of mistakes seem small. We'll see what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this big world, a widespread and inescapable law implies that two things can not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">There's no way of breaking that rule and do not try too much, because it will end up hurting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it also has a law of its kind : the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", a "state" consisting, roughly, of some of its features.</seg>
<seg id="12">Physicists particles classified into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermions, which obey the Pauli principle wisely.</seg>
<seg id="14">And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not by this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the website The Particle Adventure Berkeley Laboratories which, incidentally, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "force particles", by which large forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons, it should be stressed here are not exotic bugs might believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you can read this chronicle, is thanks to a remarkably banal boson : the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "clutters" the electromagnetic field at that environment, a bit like when you throw a stone into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, the ultraviolet, etc..), And this wave is nothing that a photon, ie one of the bosons "force carriers".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "messy" for this boson appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate need to reach extremely high energies, a bit like if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">By this requires a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference!) To achieve such levels of energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all particles or all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, make, but others : a piece of paper, for example, will not be maintained by itself never stuck to the door of a refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field : those that do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Now, what "can provide" all these investigations, asks Mrs. Plamondon.</seg>
<seg id="29">For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows the physicists escrutinen the differences between observations and predictions of MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">For their part, many wish fervently that they are, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain model holes.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, frankly, is still enormous gaps, as it does not propose any explanation on gravity (ups!) Or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (another oops).</seg>
<seg id="32">But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">aftermath</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of this research in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not mistake that will not have any.</seg>
<seg id="35">To see : the early 60s, the pioneers of lasers in the laboratory did not suspect at all that his works provoke revolution.</seg>
<seg id="36">Glimpsed scientific applications, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, as I said physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, the laser was invented in 1960, and produced the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, the first laser was rather considered a ' laboratory apparatus ".</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And further, applications can also be derived from all instrumentation surrounding research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a sensor light in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not his original intention whatsoever, this sensor is now serving "eye" for all digital devices in the world, earning him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In his Die in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should resume soon while preparing a bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, within that domain essential, there is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has sought closer look.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was given five years to live, but I have been so seven," he says, made a pass, lying on his bed in the hospice Victor- Gadbois of Beloeil, which arrived yesterday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it's always a shock, we can not be prepared for this," he continues.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has caused havoc : huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom and even feed himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting in front of a very tasty lunch, accepts resignation to help you eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">Valiente, reaches even to smile, to talk to strangers they devote attention, bring medicines and offer a bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is that I cure diarrhea, is humiliating," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team found that wrong remedy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the center Victor- Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Return to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression" notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the heart of this regression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">All patients entering the hospice Victor- Gadbois with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them care no longer offer "healing".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is dying "conscious and drowned."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has made him discover his children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have some good kids," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Now I have no more desire in this life," he says, before agreeing to be fitted with a mask to help her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">And wait, in the next few days, a last visit to his son who lives in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In Victor- Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.</seg>
<seg id="29">Palliative care are given to them when you can not do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">To help make his death more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">Very little, since we know that all end up dying someday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life goes on in the best possible condition, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether comfort level physical, emotional or spiritual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you are offered dying mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the diabetics and controls are not your cup sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">Death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night we serve a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the center Victor- Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to a man of 94 years who savors his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between your pillows while all drink to your health, a young man of 36 years dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after having tried everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For six months, provided there are three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years with cancer", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients who are admitted to the center - Gadboisarrivent Victor comes home and 47% of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, ie, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a care.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several agencies, including the Victor- Gadbois center and hospice society 's home Grand Montréal, specializing almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is this large relative lack of Quebec health care which makes many specialist palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since last October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec 's health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting proceed with euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Recently," he says, " I saw a patient in the ER spend 14 days in great pain without having done enough to alleviate it.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive proper care. "</seg>
<seg id="53">And in parallel, many oncologists are bent with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.</seg>
<seg id="54">Survival Hopes Hélène Richard were already under minimal when left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.</seg>
<seg id="55">"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she said she was very sorry that would stop fighting," he says.</seg>
<seg id="56">"However,she had told me there was nothing else to do!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No care almighty</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients die applying thank their caregivers that they have attended in their demands once they have relieved their pain by a palliative care team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But I must say that palliative care are not absolutely omnipotent with respect to pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatments for pain in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, used to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We can not pretend we do not understand that part of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Increasingly, unrelieved disease will be able to have that palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are not relieved they all say the same thing: "I want to die".</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not necessarily mean "want euthanasia" but "I want to relieve me."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, applies also with his team of auditors, researchers and government analysts.</seg>
<seg id="11">This unit operates in addition to the police "squad Marteau", which, since 2009, have made the "sewer cartel" moderate Montreal when inflated contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">In recent weeks, the unit proceeded to the registration number of the allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town outside.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec City third.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter has shocked the committee to explain the mechanics of the "system" to obtain public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">He himself paid for three years by 3% of the value of contracts awarded to an intermediary in Montreal linked to mafia money transferred to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">M. Zambito distributed money right and left during the 2000s, providing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted, too, having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">The cost inflation sewerage contracts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, former engineer of public works, explained it perfectly before the committee : in ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of$ 736,000, all in return for contracts whose costs inflated sewer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other roads officials have admitted receiving money by inflating invoices between 30% and 40% as false extras.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, a party organizer mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay have deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected political Montreal who sounded the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">As mayor of the district of Rivière - des -Prairies, in the east of the island, opposed from 2010 to the sale of municipal land acquired for$ 5 million and 1.6 million resold by promoters in the real estate boom.</seg>

<seg id="30">He adds that the process is "painful but positive."</seg>
<seg id="31">We are cleaning the wounds but would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be alert to dubious practices do not recur.</seg>
<seg id="32">How do the cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, states that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is restless especially the role of the ' "elected politicians aware of the ploy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was spent on campaign financing in Quebec, quips : "I have said that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit to$ 100 donations to parties, but that does not change the donation, he said, "while not strictly limited election expenses, will dirty money in politics."</seg>
<seg id="37">It advocates a comprehensive review of the system of granting public contracts and financing parties "can not sink any lower, go to the bottom of things, with courage, we will rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws".</seg>

<seg id="38">If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season he has acquired a new entity with the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How would you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players have come.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day I walk beside her.</seg>
<seg id="7">The staff also provided me a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a game, that's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is going very quickly in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I did not heated up.</seg>
<seg id="12">From my beginnings in the center of INF Clairefontaine preforming up my time Saint - Etienne, I have always made great strides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You will get the benefit of competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recruits this summer are used to play high level games.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know that every workout is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">That makes a player as I have will to fight and give everything.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is supported by assistants as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the man? Needed equipment?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, no one alike in the League 1 and is among the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience and has won numerous titles at the best clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think it will be other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I had a very comforting him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had just emerged from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?</seg>
<seg id="30">In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the position of leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our major goals is the Champions League : we have qualified for the knockout stages in style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the aim of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to get as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we have much to say in front of many great European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want to begin to end the first of our league against Porto to qualify for the knockout round.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Does the PSG can become a big European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">I have the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and be there long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Economically, the PSG is delivered to their means for that project completion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">No win in the League Cup 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure??</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we will invest all our efforts to take the title of champions.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we did not get far.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May we were hugely disappointed because we had optimal conditions to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had a strong season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We ended up with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Usually, with 79 points should have been champions...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year I think will be good.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to grab.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think the media expect more of PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal to expect much of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have accepted fully.</seg>
<seg id="57">After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, still encounter things that reproach is a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what else people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We can never win 4-0 every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We tried to start a game project.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the second round, and they have also invested a lot!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the amount invested, I would imagine with 15 points ahead of the day.</seg>
<seg id="66">That would be neglecting our adversaries and the French championship.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, they were not good last season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the League 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">May I hope that we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we finished taking us the trophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic hits.</seg>
<seg id="71">Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia".</seg>
<seg id="72">That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">It has come to prove who is the star of the League 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">And has shown on all computers on which happened to be a great player, a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group respect the man and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">And he also respects to the men who have around.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">That pushes others to increase their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all we progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you lived Euro 2012 with the French team?</seg>
<seg id="81">It was a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I was very excited to participate in this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me accumulate playing time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I went there and saw things reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today achieving good games to play in the selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus".</seg>
<seg id="87">We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and this is because we now have an exemplary behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What vision do you have the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">It is getting results.</seg>
<seg id="90">They are well placed in the group of World Cup qualifying.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win.</seg>
<seg id="92">As was the case of Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I will not make comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope Didier Deschamps selection carried to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Does the tie (1-1) on October 16 in Spain served to lay the foundation?</seg>
<seg id="97">That game gave us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought by all.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, the transactions identified and processing loads between the parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also, as often happens in technology, political vision is palpable : the conviction that the current monetary system, banking monopolies compound leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc.. and secure exchange protocol BitTorrent 's way, which allows the sharing of files equals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">There have been nearly 200,000 15,000 transactions by computers on the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The price of bitcoin, having reached the peak of$ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to$ 2 five months later, before returning today to be around ten dollars (the quotes were counted on page bitcoincharts. com).</seg>
<seg id="8">It's not impressive when compared to global changes in real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual coins issued in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">In it, he described the bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "Racing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is different from other types of systems with virtual currencies as the "credits" used to advance a video game and you can win playing or you can buy (and sometimes even redeem).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But all sharing a central authority controls and deal with changes.</seg>
<seg id="14">With bitcoin, all network nodes are both trustees of ledgers, testers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses as email.</seg>
<seg id="17">A user can select a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction are electronically signed by a double cipher key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes appearing on the public ledger, which spreads throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key milestone is to write the new transaction in that book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This happens by solving a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker will have the privilege of adding the complementary strand.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a file chopping phase, ie processing a large file into a shorter and numerical fingerprint unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers "catch" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" the set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number that offers a particular trace (more zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once that number is found, the other nodes is easily verified that good.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructibly chain linked to the other sets of transactions, any modification would change the footprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, to commit fraud, a user would pay twice for the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept as valid only one of the two transactions, the other would be left an orphan, as both have traces different.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that meets the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regular, likely by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but are divisible to cienmillonésimo, leaving a wide margin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of this challenge are also disclosed in each increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The lifetime of the network already has its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed on deposit bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The ruling does not affect use same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, which just launched Paymium a payment company that uses real currency Bitcoin network.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash has the same defect.</seg>
<seg id="38">The major players like Wikipedia reject such payments.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Insitito in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, they released the "sales giants."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Changed$ 30,000" exults Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins in gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, author of a book on that currency pedagogical, believes enough in the potential of this technology as well as in network transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but use Bitcoin to validate transactions, so are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement in the shops, you do not have to install new devices or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">We simply provide an address than a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, which claims thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement systems review flatter hierarchical systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take a while for Bitcoin is imposed, but in 2013 could be a change," he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Furthermore, in its report on ECB expected to reassess the various risks, today considered high, if that currency is successful.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul since late 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was now empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of release, return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of his peasants overwhelmed by the Al- Qaeda, but his situation is no better today.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have become speculators, seizing government land for resale as solar refugees have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the American pair of large outsourcing contracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are discredited, most of them have not fought.</seg>
<seg id="22">People, I hear on the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, as also will those who have taken advantage of American generosity : capital flight is considerable.</seg>

<seg id="32">The former anti-Soviet commanders worry and struggle to reconstitute the provincial militias, they will flee the central power.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should qualify for some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has sought to transform into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister was from the 1964 Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular during elections scheduled in April 2014.</seg>

<seg id="40">It spread rumors that Afghan poseía huge mining wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">And that not only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy to extract iron ore or copper ground without transportation for export through the mountains, no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have almost abandoned copper mine Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig the huge Buddhist site and remain there as major employers in the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.</seg>

<seg id="46">The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls' schools, schools of children, a French department in the university, the French Institute, the cooperation in military, legal, and health and agricultural support archaeological delegation.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Constitution with forceps in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a double or nothing new President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is more divided than ever as to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play all out.</seg>
<seg id="4">He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote the final text the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just last week, the head of State had two months to the Assembly to finish its work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And nearly two years ago that Egypt used a provisional text several amendments, weakening institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has not only increased the fracture in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">To his opponents, the president continues with its "delirium autocratic" and continues "betraying his word" and "trampling the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">By its supporters, ensuring that it is a measure to stop faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the next 15 days should organize a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time forcing the brothers to give up his project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way to regain popular legitimacy and democratic while controversy rages across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in their favor, as said in an interview with the weekly magazine Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that this resource has voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, "or vote my text or keep full powers" powers that supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist overwhelmingly voted yesterday text.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals did not attend the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they felt that they could not enforce their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, yesterday morning 11 people added, substitute members, hastily.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">As expected, the items have been voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">To the commentators amuses them, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day is expressed nearly the hour of prayer, so much so that several committee members came to think that the clock Constituent was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted, consists of 234 items.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2, object of attention, finally remains identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafi parties for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hopefully be able to replace the "principles" by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liberals be labeled as hypocrisy and consider that it is nothing more than a publicity stunt.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other items.</seg>
<seg id="29">They refer, in particular, Article 220, which gives the Al- Azhar University an advisory role, particularly for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, is disturbing because "people are to decide not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Liberals Fears are further increased by the fact that the next president of the university would be far less moderate than today.</seg>
<seg id="33">" For now, there is no particular religious involvement.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution we are in the context of marital status.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who have worked in this text are not mullahs but college, some of them trained in the French system, "explains Alexis Blouet, preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about Article 220 , because the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">" We refer in particular to the term IQH [ Islamic jurisprudence, editor's note ].</seg>
<seg id="38">And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are civil courts have jurisdiction over this. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism relating to extended powers conferred by the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were under the previous regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another point of conflict : the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">Accordance with the wish of the military, the Defense budget review will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national council of defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nor prohibit prosecution of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defense of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">They also showed their concerns relating to the text, which consider liberticidal.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offense of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, Heba Morayef stresses of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word is not contained in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Although the Egyptian president was out last night on TV, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The head of state supporters demonstrated on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow : immigrants save for language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While deputies and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that the law on compulsory examination, have already appeared in the country certified scammers who sell "fake"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most are citizens of countries of Central Asia : Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its sole purpose is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">From December 1 enters into force a law, according to which every immigrant labor should perform a test to check your knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this rule is applicable only for those who intend to work in the services sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, over time, as promised in the Federal Migration Service, the tests will be mandatory for all immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">Furthermore, it is sufficient to take the examination of the language, but also the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exception are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are not subject to this law people who successfully get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Utility doom and rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of examiners work sponsored by Pushkin Russian Language Institute, University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian institutions of higher learning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Immigrants may be submitted to the tests in all the cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="17">But advocates of the rights, long before the law came into force, succeeded many times to ask this question to the press : And what this actually provide?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes will bring the obligatory knowledge of the language, both for the Russians as to the immigrants themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First, meet representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labor."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people talk today about the rights of labor migrants, says Victor Sebelev, chief representative of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">The defense of their rights should be initiated prior to departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems the immigrants have no profession, education, those who know the language and pass the medical control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the intending immigrant will be sentenced to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping him mess a ' little trip paid " a creepy and narrow den, where he and dozens of others like consumed him for months without food or documents, working 12-14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In their homeland they promise one thing, but on arrival they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, not paid promised wages" confirms the Head of the Department of Labour immigration Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not get angry, jefecito!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, while many citizens of the republics of Central Asia who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country you intend to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not so much their fault but his own misfortune few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive regular primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is because their families do not even have anything to feed the children, not to mention dressing, putting them on and buy them you need for school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Upon reaching adolescence, these guys are venturing to work at the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult if you do not know the language, recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and inferior".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, in regard to the law on language rights advocates point out an important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">The examinations will be held only for those immigrants whose status is legal.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have that status, there will be no consideration and therefore no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or No Trespassing strangers"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many visitors say they receive official status in our country is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.</seg>
<seg id="41">Furthermore, legalization costs money : for 12000-16000 rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, a false registration can be done quickly and for only 1500 rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Employees of the Russian police know that we usually false documents are not registered and extortion cases appear.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We ask one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," he told reporters citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, do not be stingy, buy a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The first day of the entry into force of the law on the tongue, it became clear that not only alien registration documents may be false.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several certificates "false" knowledge of language have been seized by officers of the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="48">The forged documents were printed on standard printers color.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners as a gift : every immigrant, willing to make it easier to pass the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is two and half times more expensive than the formal procedure, which cost the three thousand migrant worker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption for the "diplomas" not to buy, converge government officials and rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="52">So far, the authorities can promise the immigrant workers that could not successfully pass the exam the first time to study the basics of the language course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.</seg>

<seg id="1">The employees go on strike fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, the United States has started a wave of protests against low wages paid in the supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">By now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave come at nine points, or if you lose strength and amansarse intended in its early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Protest actions have the support of trade unions and a number of leftist NGOs.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the modest increase in wages earned by workers in Walmart and fast food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions in these companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Forty -six cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Stocks started last week, after Thanksgiving Day, known as "Black Friday". That day, in the United States coomenzaba the orgy of cuts that captured million, and sometimes was accompanied by clashes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">That day, some Walmart employees of the corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed picket lines with unions and leftist activists in the tents of the corporation, whose products target people of modest and moderate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the larger supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That's why many Walmart workers underpaid buy only at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and product assortment have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as lack of forklift or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That "Black Friday" rally participants demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">For a typical worker Walmart, which receives$ 9.5 per hour, this cost is excessive, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to$ 12 an hour, this will cost the corporation$ 3.2 trillion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is about 1.1% more than they spent on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart sets the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will find only 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of$ 12.39 more than you spend now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Walmart supporters commenting satisfied that the protest had taken place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "Black Friday" in their stores lasted from 8 pm on Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold over 5000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total, their cash registers performed "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with leftist website Huffington Post, who left his job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest was not just "another PR stunt"organized by the labor union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free Box"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, in which the goals were not exactly the department store Walmart (which in this progressive city will not have appreciated, so for now there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other restaurants Cheap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald 's says that sells billions of servings, and then not even granted sick leave and not pay you for your work honest!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, according to the federal and New York, the minimum wage is$ 7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food restaurants are going to increase over time, but only slightly, and average, ordinary workers in New York receive$ 8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody wins unless they in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How is it possible to survive in New York with the money, to me is incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counter, part time after school, but still living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or were planning to stay there long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal is a commentary whose author says it is irresponsible to have children if she does not know what to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 am on Thursday at the McDonald's of 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and fast food cooks start paying them at least$ 15 per time, that is, they were double its current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that the fast food sector unions are created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. law prevent administration prohibits this right and punish labor movement activists with tricks and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">Moreover, the administration rarely makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions covering quick meal sector.</seg>
<seg id="44">A major is the excessive turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">discordant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place the same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several politicians local Democrats, including City Council member city Jumaane Williams, who said : "McDonald's says it is selling billions of servings, and then not even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example the candidate Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers fast food sector to achieve fair wages and economic prosperity you deserve every New Yorker."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in American history of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it took only a few hundred people, even not all of them were employees of fast food service, which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not clear if this will spark to cause a mass movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"For now, trick the brain is not so easy"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The augmented reality theme, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately mainly normally perceived through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">In early summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in movement and later, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to the relevant patent claim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, in a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology in Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, was elucidated that scientists of that company, the glasses and belonged to a past stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are attracted by the prospect of virtual object manipulation in the air with his bare hands and the establishment of open virtual spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please, in general terms, what is the subject matter of his research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We specialize in human-computer interaction, but also try to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now, the vast mass of humanity has been trapped in the stage of working with flat screen pixels, sometimes touched with your finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today is sold without any Xbox Kinect, and that everyone interested in gesture control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What else does the future hold?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although Kinect interaction has led to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, we work in truly three-dimensional display systems, based on different technologies, including design.</seg>
<seg id="15">They should release the computer world to ours, physicist, make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, we must recognize not only the user, but also the surrounding space.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="18">First,to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">A detail very popular, but do not you think it overestimated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Of course it can not be considered a panacea, left unresolved the issue of privacy as it does not always want others to know of our actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not loose motions but shorter.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, gestures were not captured by the device camera, but for a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is now very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general, the future is to control combined type, eg gesture + speech.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How so?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how would you ask me that would happen this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You talk and display at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually just talk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- You mean, you want to force users to adapt to what can or can not do at this time the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think in the near future we will have to work primarily in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.</seg>
<seg id="35">These can be, for example, laser sensors because they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">¿ Les lack resolution, depth on something more?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the issue is not the megapixels, but the quality of the array and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, this is more work to algorithm designers.</seg>
<seg id="42">So, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y, but also in Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also important is the speed, number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movements are quite dynamic and current of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor processing adjustable delay 1-100 ms and it is noteworthy that the modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands what extent this affects the human-machine interaction.</seg>
<seg id="47">To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but does not require contact so that the frames per second more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- What is necessary to increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The Kinect now has three "chambers", one of which is indeed infrared transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the third chamber is actually a simple tuning fork sensor visible.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially, more number of cameras may solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect, play with the curvature of camera location and see how this would help determinr dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has submitted his glasses to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do not you think that, from the point of view of daily use augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in the hands, not very comfortable, but I think, the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could spend sunglasses to your smartphone,</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are very personal devices, in that is its strength (private things only you can see them), but also its weakness : one based augmented reality glasses will not work on virtual objects with others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in air is available not only for Tony Stark in the movie "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem in this idea that critics often point :no tactile feedback!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands do not feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers prepare your group for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh appearance in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">Registerperfect touch!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are technologies that are truly designed to bring tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of various ultrasonic beams directed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to what you feel if someone was blowing in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to trick the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Make him think he feels what seems like it should feel when you see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- That's a good idea, we have not tried yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lies another challenge that we have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space that will create open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not such as gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.</seg>
<seg id="73">For now, trick the brain is not so easy, even you have to work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what makes it attractive to work with virtual reality researchers, many things are in a state of total conception.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde", dedicated to the people that are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.</seg>
<seg id="3">In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city often find recognition in Europe without Russia even know them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or trendy meetings and inaugurations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kirill Miller 's paintings always attract crowds wherever they are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of those storytellers purely sociofilósofos St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a bright representative of St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's - early 90's.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the town awaken in the people smiles and lifts all the mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, he took a barrel organ and became the organ of St. Petersburg, as it has matured as difficult to paper, bohemian existence, philosophy and image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose the color red because I am fashion designer and dedicate myself to the look and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image makers and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although society, everything that is not a little gray aggressiveness and agitation raises nothing good properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are intended to start a conversation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The entire history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - When you realized you had to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - In an exhibition Nevsky Palace of Culture, where he exhibited my works.</seg>
<seg id="19">I realized that this was my path.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the old wave of unofficial artists was over, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">I became friends with artists of the new wave, with post setting out in Gaza and Nevsky, which led to "Pushkinskaya -10", and it's over the next wave.</seg>
<seg id="22">I fell into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but no letters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - And all this came together in your art clinic... - For me it was important to meet the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where he had to meet the best creative minds.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I took a territory Pushkinskaya -10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical arts club, bohemian club, bohemian house in St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there : Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember how Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh 's Ear."</seg>
<seg id="26">Schnur and his friends sang songs under phonogram light, wearing tight pants, among them was currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group began playing live, became "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before Hali - galivskih times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career, basic education and training he received from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Gallery "D 137", the " Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">There were our employees and repeat customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "The people of our city."</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was chosen me, so ended my climax.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these new times is not convenient to work, I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In our times it is easy to catch on, but the culture and popularity are separated. One may be popular but little worship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - There is something recognizable in your work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - Many of my paintings are hits, clearly expressed in them today and occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are a timeless category.</seg>
<seg id="41">I used to be outgoing, but now be so painful and frightening.</seg>
<seg id="42">But clowns all smears and tragedy is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, bizarre thoughts I have.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and coercive change of clothes.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now follow him one by clothing, verging on the outside, but not inside the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">And, maybe that person is not owed or shaking hands, but spit in his face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the deception will be removed when changing clothes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - I recently saw you in the role of urban organ. - A cultured city should have a hero well.</seg>
<seg id="49">Whobetter than me to be!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Well but how to best commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, be tactful.</seg>
<seg id="52">We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before people clustered in herds, Bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons other.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I'm not a hundred dollar bill to be liked by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now we have to think about who you like.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> -And to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands!</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We obtain results in a regular chick.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is that this chick has to find support, must stand on its own feet and get moving," says Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IWP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Finding no support, tumbled random chicks.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 hours in neonates there was a total atrophy of instincts.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who orbited twice and even worked in the open, had a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk persists.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="47">We are few, only a handful of astronauts after long flight who they have found all well, and a healthy generation is growing.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">However, mankind must find some new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside the mother in amniotic fluid, it will be easier then the water used.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath spend only two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenov, swimming instructor newborns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if a state of weightlessness is more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary gravitation, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In weightlessness the abdominal muscles and pelvic decrepitate quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for delivery.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Then what?" Valeri Polyakov is this original question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Moreover, the child also needs artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without a sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton and the muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress him in a special suit for training, as well as adults.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just be deprived of what is vital to him.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us to bring to Earth a disabled, a person totally unsuitable" provides the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical Problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, over time this will become a reality, when human beings in their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">NKÚ Chief : System Inspection "Švarc" no politician has found guilty</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In terms of public allotments, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and good legislation, but implementation is lame.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">So says Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect" but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we need" and describes the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Sets controls Czechs and Germans inspectors also come to similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of malpractice mentions Petr Nečas attitude towards the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the system "Švarc".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Prime Minister recently said the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother with inspectors entrepreneurs. So what is forbidden or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be regulated in some way and if you prohibit something, in this case, neither the prime minister can impede the performance of the office that is required to perform such checks or demand obligations," notes Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the House of Representatives, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and the German team, within which compared the legislation regarding public purchasing in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control we started to realize about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply : European legislation regulates how they should organize public awards, this is followed by the laws in force in each country and then practice itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We've joined all and while control is still ongoing, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the laws of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, clearly evident in some parameters is better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is therefore confirmed that incorporate not just increasingly strict rules, but is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What indeed can bring this project? What do you think are the conclusions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Precisely common control like this could help us to stop investing effort in the realization of the laws, reduction and improvement of bounds, even though it has such a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy of savings means getting a proper thing for a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to prevent enrichment and, ultimately, the criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not for the fact of reducing the limit of the awards mean we get it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork" that those who want to find fault in the system will make it more easily than if the boundaries are kept as high as now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing public prácticaa of awards.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of checks in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is an office like our NKÚ or organized differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">On how to offices, as the NKÚ, there acts the German Federal (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, only thing is that if one is structured somewhat differently, but in principle evolve both offices simultaneously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the skills are somewhat similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the national audit found even at this level. In this aspect our system is slightly different.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Federal Court of Audit (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds that are managed by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As local law, is simpler than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Usually I would not make a comparison without specifics. However, Germany remains a model in some ways, but we can not determine exactly which is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Could be better, for example, as to the quality of inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That sure did not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">Needless to say, even those countries that we model must deal with a large number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, no benefit would not work with our office, do not you think?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As for the legislation of our country, what it meant to her office amendment bill on public allotments? Is it somehow manifests its impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not been demonstrated in the control actions.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we control ex post, it must have a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For now, it appears in the process of preparation of future controls : We have launched a new tool "noneconomic risk detection", which we have spent almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since adjusting the boundaries, correcting the conditions of some types of the selection process and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you think that the passage of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess for the bureaucratic system?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it does.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise is that the legislation "harden" and make it impossible to comply.</seg>
<seg id="40">As with the previous legislation, persons controlled were linked to the contractor (eg, in the case of regional operational programs of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public allotments meant the violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Does it make sense then tighten the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think so.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to take advantage of it attacking or not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">A system of this type will only create more bureaucratic pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And what comes out of this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We'll see where this road takes us started.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not bother with controls entrepreneurs called Švarc system, with reference to being independent only on paper. What does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Does the system Švarc " is forbidden or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent Office action that is required to perform such checks and demand obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say, "We change the law and allow", but can not say we like nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the public purchasing law, the rules are quite strict in terms of how we should act formally. And that is as it should be to protect the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best deal for not meeting the formal requirements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">It is said that in less than a month will come the end of the world, what do you think about it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is only one among many other alarmist news we like to hold on to.</seg>
<seg id="4">The music group The Tap Tap rather we like to joke about it and we like to say we are the only band in the world to get together enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Furthermore, in December organize yourselves truly original project : three concerts with the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you explain to our readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">This is a charity event that took planning state for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to leverage the marketing potential that is the end of the Mayan calendar statement for December 21 at 11:10 am.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before, on December 20 at 21 am, we will host three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">End at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends in the Kiribati island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially my idea, after forging the project went together with our designer Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we want to reflect, together with society, on the state of the world we leave our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">To mark the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that are available at www.e - tap.cz, another way to support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Tap Tap The group, along with other performers, also sang the hymn called against the end of the world, entitled "End of the World, canceled".</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently it is very popular on YouTube, is able to hear at concerts beneficial?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, and will be just the last, well, if all goes well and the world ends...</seg>
<seg id="18">The performers sing all at the same time in all three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the video, where he sings Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did this collaboration?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We work with other personalities including the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We make every effort to participate in this project.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has been shown that most interests them and they enjoy working with us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What do you use the money raised at concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A school equipment for Studeo barrier, which we term in its sixth consecutive year of the civil association in Jedličkův ústav Tap.</seg>
<seg id="27">Students at the school receive regular ústav Jedličkův visit teachers we made fun and interesting activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay the teachers and make a EINFORCING to make this possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will go to this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert act several groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What are the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We try to develop a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy.</seg>
<seg id="34">For more detailed information, you can check www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Have you planned some other "spectacular action" like in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May act for the first time at the festival Pražské bird, so here surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me personally, we are building in the United States, I would like to complete with performances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your overseas plans are not exactly minimalist, until now have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap are in the meantime, a group formed by people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How is the logistics and organization of these trips?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">There are five members in electric wheelchair, the seats should ride in the luggage compartment and also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far we have managed well. CSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, everything went smoothly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to trips abroad can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and others.</seg>
<seg id="46">What have you found so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here, in Russia we have seen that in the east, is a long way to go.</seg>
<seg id="48">Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common for a person to travel alone through the city center on a power wheelchair.</seg>
<seg id="49">Something as common as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair lift, there is not.</seg>
<seg id="50">Luckily, we have created a civil association strives thematize the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">What aspects should take example of developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many ways in which we are behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the refinement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is very normal for people with severe disabilities to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, the museum, wherever...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in an active social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tapgoing a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">A society that respects and without barriers is one thing, but when the moment arising eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, begin to change all really.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap Tap The group is currently very popular, but if you look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I started as ústav Jedličkův educator, where he had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a coworker.</seg>
<seg id="61">And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we were a little out of hand (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">However, the popularity did not come until the last few years, am I right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It really helped us a lot the fact singers connect and actively work to promote the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We conclude that the work is not seen, it is like there.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I saw the potential he had, to do anything otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="68">The entertainment world is full of things that look like each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">It stands in its way, everything new is welcomed cautiously and takes a long time to be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are few things extraordinary, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion is a natural reaction...</seg>
<seg id="72">But compassion is entirely superfluous because people with disabilities are not left suffering beings and we should have compassion.</seg>
<seg id="73">Some people are able to live a full and developed, provided of course that the necessary resources available.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then, is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the entire society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Did the fact that you are an exacting boss, as he describes many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you want to do quality work, we must be rigorous in many respects and to require some discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think it's completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people go with a romantic view and head in the clouds and when they learn they have to go two days to rehearse, go to school and try to spend much time traveling and concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandoned them.</seg>
<seg id="79">But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The group currently has twenty members Tap Tap.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one : Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, the people come and go, you can not avoid.</seg>
<seg id="84">Whoever has will and desire will always find open doors</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 am</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena in Fléda Plynojem Brno and Ostrava and involve 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song by The Tap Tap "End of the World, canceled"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is to bring together the resources necessary to fund school equipment multifunctional barrier ústav Jedličkův Studeo in Prague, the cost is 25 million CZK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The concert ticket cost 400 CZK and children 12 and under are admitted free presale option in Bohemiaticket</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week was accepted Poland as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began an intense collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the commission of agency projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Poles and enthusiasts dedicated themselves to flights into space before the Second World War, although not always understand his work.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remember, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld 's astronomical observatory that Warsaw in the December 6, 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to space flight."</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience indifferent and, years later, Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one who had shown interest in their work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 Sternfeld earned the award in France Robert Esnault - Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to space flight."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published hundreds of articles in Polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became a promoter of space flight, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the far side of the moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 one was built in Poland Dresina was to be equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the proponent and Destaller not know the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is unclear whether the rocket would be used to boot the Dresina or for braking.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information on this Dresina is limited to that in the press of the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Beginning in 1933 the Polish artillery began to engage missiles.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the material retained, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation stopped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 appeared in the press a prototype missile photoelectric hunting Rohozinski designed by engineer and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Lotnicza" Leliwa - Krzywoblocki author.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were intended for military use for missile engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, the interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Komitet Tymczasowy Doradczo - Naukowy) was responsible for all technical projects of missiles for military use and coordinated all work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the outbreak of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other studies on space flight appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy referred first society with very large four articles dedicated to astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time had already launched artificial satellites projects was obvious that it was a cosmic research discipline prospects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since early 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">He held this post until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">As of 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a hit and became the first Polish rocket which carried out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM- 1 was completed in 1957 and first released on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket had a height of 1800 meters, about 80 cm in length and was less than 5 kg of weight.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, was completed RM- 1A version in the summer of 1959 and began testing rockets overhead RM-2 two-stage Błędów desert.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another type of rocket development would be subject to real scientific study. The RM- 34 rocket would have a height of 14.5 km and its mission is to control the wind high.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962 work was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor of the first rockets was rocket type RM Meteor -1, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">Was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Developed three types (called Meteor- 1A, - 1B and -1C), which is differentiated by the space available for scientific apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="41">Meteor the rocket -1A available space for the volume was 0.4 liters in the Meteor- 1B 0.34 liter Meteor- 1C at 0.62 liters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum height for all three types was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 took place at the Institute Meteor Air -2 rocket, which first air testing began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Meteor -2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg, and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high.</seg>
<seg id="45">Version was later built and Meteor Meteor- 2H -3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of COSPAR National Committee two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the framework of Interkosmos, Poland joined cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish driver Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The constitutional court last week suspended the social traabajos law.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision sparked a heated debate in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Consequently, this means that different forms economic and national economic systems permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The effect of large differences in labor costs (in wages) produces economic tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, try to close the gap and it "causes a bajadda" competitor pricing in order to gain most of the market and, thereby increase its profit margin.</seg>
<seg id="10">A large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, in comparison with other economies, is higher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has not any social responsibility and thus, is not responsible for this phenomenon generates unemployment, growing social necessarily state spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation favors the total lack of business by paying taxes and offset the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present factual statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social status of the people themselves and, thus, attract foreign capital country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Put another way, governments put private capital available to its own population without considering social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is evident especially in the changing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in regard to wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This occurs, first, through the system of financial obligation in the case of long-term unemployment, and secondly, by the restricted right of employees regarding labor rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">For a number of years, there are in Germany Food Delivery points for poor people who can not support their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people receiving this type of aid comes as a million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Under the increased competitiveness of the German economy, there is a common case : employees with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to get to the bare minimum to survive.</seg>
<seg id="23">Was made public a scandal of this type related to the situation of clerks German federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">Saving measures virtually all southern states of the EU lead, no doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by a decline abysmal social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or bad life with lousy wages on the edge of society, with the hope that some day come to the country private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">Is it necessary preguntrarse come from?</seg>
<seg id="26">In the case in question from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians and Africans continue to work for a fraction of European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and the media endlessly claim that the state should not provide capital to the economy, which run the economy leading to its failure.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private equity fiercely defends the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence his selfishness in the political march and, therefore, all over the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this case the answer is clearly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation which manifests in the area of corruption, mutual favors in legislation that is virtually everywhere reprehensible but not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is as follows : government ministries, a lack of financial means, charge drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Such bills are approved after the Bundestag, the German parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but strong financial groups representing their interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that liberal democracies are oriented quickly in a situation like that described Appiános in his Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeii : "The state had long disintegrated and administrations forcibly occupied".</seg>
<seg id="38">In exchange for bribes, favors obtained unlawfully and help fund stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption spread without hindrance and the people went to the polls to vote bespoken in advance "..." there were no people with character who aspires to a position in the administration, so once because of this disorganization, the state spent eight months without consuls "..." He began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the autocracy and it was necessary to choose an energetic man "... While thinking of Pompeii Appiános Caesar came to power and democracy transformed forever into autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion, just as in ancient times, is that society is based on individual benefit inconsiderate preferences regardless of common interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital can not, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is the same as it was then, a decline unprecedented elite, without performing an effort to be thoroughly reformed.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should be sought, therefore, to the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">With respect to the current situation, you might consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal -style democracy, as defined paused, waiting for the next blow.</seg>
<seg id="45">The really devastating fact is that current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know in ancient history and the most recent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The suspension of the public purchasing law is not the solution, at least not long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is, therefore, systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is concrete socio-political reforms, which enhance both the participation of state capital as the influence of citizens in government and to weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society for the benefit of the state.</seg>

<seg id="7">My intention is to give readers a look behind the scenes, a look to see who takes advantage of the tensions dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my views are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, who or what group of people is the primary driver of events in modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the history of mankind in the history of the struggle for power is in the front row.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every age can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">But what is not so clear is whether these characters were always those who directed their steps independently or behind his throne was someone that guided their actions towards a certain goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must accept that we live in a time that the world's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power involved, could not be reached in a single generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of these families highlights a rich astronomically could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind do not know, but do not rule) : the Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not much is written about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the 90s of XIX century bought the first news agency (Reuters) so stop associating his name with very serious criminal acts. The power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which to them always meant a strengthening.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have major holdings in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries that are not represented, has pleaded or preparing a war : before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, then to topple Gaddafi were only four, but meanwhile Russia has subject the central bank to the Russian government.</seg>
<seg id="18">Everyone who has tried to oppose this family died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state central bank Bank of America of Rothschild, began during the Civil War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK started printing money and wanted to stay the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">His quest for world power during the years it took 1859 - 1871 to develop a plan with three world wars designed by Freemason Albert Pike, who was awarded the degree 33.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was marked as objective eliminate large monarchical states in Europe, the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (such number of slaves to their welfare and enough luxury and consume so many resources), and the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which the group operates from the wealthiest families, together with Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the onset of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (ab cao order - order out of chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are, however, wrong, and always involve a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the Fed was created to not repeat a crisis like that of 1907.</seg>
<seg id="25">So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro -Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after that, following this, the outbreak of the First World War destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the standpoint of military and economic, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end tsarist Russia were now unnecessary) and the subsequent breakup of the great Central European power, the rule Austro -Hungarian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="27">To set the stage for World War II, allowed the bankers and politicians create, so undercover, a conflict as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, which was created optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they simply had to serve the German Fuehrer's solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to blame, and build then a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority was represented and represented well the function the fifth column, that ignited the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">By the late nineteenth century, the Rothschild Foundation promoted the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The aforementioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundation for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">World War II broke out : it is difficult to know whether Hitler too pulled the rope that had bound the international bankers at first or if all he did was part of a plan.

<seg id="1">Argo Movie : If you put oil, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a group of Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 graduates.</seg>
<seg id="3">His release would be to change the dethroned Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the U.S. administration the situation offered no positive outlook : throw overboard shah not could afford it, because if he did, jeopardizing the trust of its allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within reach.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently was further intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention of the Algerian government negotiator.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the U.S., their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="9">Failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film "Argo" director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before taking the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a complicated journey, ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.</seg>
<seg id="13">CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, got them out of Iran, for it helped a cover story bizarre point : out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for the shooting of a sci-fi blockbuster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combining genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan drew expert "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required collaboration with Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the lie seem true, was written about the film project journals, organized press conferences, the production company even had an office fictional reality.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck 's film is a unique combination of various genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, a realistic political thriller on the other, called "caper movie," the story of an episode that went well, a delusion (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film combine moods. Sequences found by a well-documented side of Tehran. In the credits sequence is emblematic of the era photographs of events that were depicted in the same way in the movie, there are not many differences in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And, scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits who analyze the situation in the table, in the halls of the office, by phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.</seg>
<seg id="24">The actor, who had been teased, has become a director respectable and their mode of action is no longer the target of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature, after "Gone Baby, Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, Affleck 's first film in which the action takes place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the old movie directors over Hollywood standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">And it shows in Affleck Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence embassy takeover is impressive synoptic capacity, at the same time, conveys the emotion of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and colleagues achieved a similar effect on the fictional scenes (impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The manager had to accept the fact that a story told does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">And he manages quite well. Sometimes I add something to reality here so not everything goes as elegant (the scene where the crisis looms in Tehran airport, diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit her trail become crazy).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is the control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman play a very funny how Hollywood contributors, although their characters deserved more space and are far from alone in this film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For these reasons, Affleck film loses some dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, value realization and retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it collapses, it will be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">As an evocation of a true story and as proof of what can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret service, is sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year presents a survey on most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the Rules or absurd ideas EU Workshop".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"We came up after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a quota of 40 percent women in management positions in large European companies," said Patrik Nacher Právo, the organizer of the survey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominees absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unifying the insurance policies for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, women have outstripped the best prices on life insurance because they represent a lower risk objectively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Other amazing ideas EU workshop may be proposed by the people through the end of this year."</seg>
<seg id="7">The election will take place at the end of February 2013 "reported Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of bio- fuel, as a result, damage the environment, another ban is the use of mercury thermometers life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or shadow guideline the size of chicken coops, which has contributed to considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It has criticized the factual ban using the term "butter spreads" or withdrawal of the classic bulb trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A banana quality should have a length of 14 inches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The apparatus of the Union takes these decisions often under the pressure of either commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claimed the demands of their banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 inches and could not present "abnormal curvature".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended himself by saying that it only seeks to harmonize national rules do not homogenized so far, which only complicated their marketing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rules refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states have eased on the basis that the existing policy entails a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate to win the poll might be prescribing the EU last year according to which inflatable balloons sold is obligatory warning that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also force a similar restriction applies to the use of flutes by children up to 14 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Weird Occurrences born even in our country</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Equally absurd is the Regulation on European officials : anyone who has any official role in the EU can not use the name of Macedonia. To not offend the sensibilities of Greece, talk of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of Laissez Faire liberal economists, nominated in the survey, including some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU sets the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of pay to those countries without access to the sea and the idea of giving a grant to apply for grants.</seg>
<seg id="24">This kind of ideas emerged in Brussels but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage by not having sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We ask the European Union for compensation, "he said in the fall of 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">I argued with the fact that in our country there was much cereal and, as a result of intervention buying calls, the state had warehouses full and had to export.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Pallas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">The grant for a grant was given to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Nemec (US- DEU). Specifically, is intended for writing applications for subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU : The requirements are an exception rare</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of EU regulations and likewise a more effective operation and development across the Union deserve rather, according to experts, our recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to experts, the biggest problem is, for example, the payment of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that member states have succeeded in budget negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The Czechs also strikes a chord in the same way as other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the appellation of origin of its traditional products, but our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czechs, after six years of disputes with German and Austrian, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc curd, but they had to rename the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and was renamed "tuzemák".</seg>
<seg id="36">Only products made from distilled sugar cane rum can be called, but not those made from sugar beets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of protected designations of origin in the EU, along with feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, marzipan German city Lübeck or Parma ham, already cookies eg Karlovy Vary, Pohořelice carp and Trebon and even the Žatec hop variety.</seg>
<seg id="38">As protected EU maras may be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread waffles and Hořice v Podkrkonoší.</seg>

<seg id="1">People want to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr. Senator, how he came to stand for election for president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">At about being senator president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If our country was all good, then do not submit my candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can no longer bear to watch is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and retirement ages.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to be political.</seg>
<seg id="7">When I see something I like, I try to find a solution to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I have already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce as a senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Senate has already arrived, but soon put on the road to the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="10">Not giving back to those who voted?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I always said that my candidacy for the presidency of the results depended on Senate elections.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I pointed out that if elected senator, present my candidacy for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">But my goal is not the function, the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I need maximum influence and the strongest possible mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not just that we are a nation that criticized at the bar or in front of the television, but trample anyone who wants to start a change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this are added the media, you discredit and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">IM dice that he was sobornado to journalists that he been adviser Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's talk about your ideas.</seg>
<seg id="19">We present thesis presidential fight financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and property declaration above twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">This should change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president does not have this competition and only a whole Senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to guide the craft was recognized as autonomous, and we got it.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politics: if someone comes in with a good proposal, either right or left, is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.</seg>
<seg id="26">Without pigeonholing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it does not matter, either a little left or a little right.</seg>
<seg id="30">What matters is that we get on.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together.</seg>
<seg id="32">Openly support any solution always good, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or ODS and, likewise, will be against bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It is said in jest when you say it is populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But it is not proving what you say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you try to approach them.</seg>
<seg id="37">Some may call it populism, but all proposals of which I speak and work in the world and known experts talk about them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament are only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And it can not survive in the long-term policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think if you go to people and talk to them, get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to get it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If elected president, there would be no problem in hosting a live broadcast on TV in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And eventually, they would have to communicate why they do not want.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong character pointing disputes, can put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take for instance the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time I say I'm just a fan, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For my views and ideals I try to find allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">I just started in politics and try to get as much support as possible for my program.</seg>
<seg id="50">I try to get things done myself, but if it does not work out, in six years I will leave and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sounds a bit like Okamura out to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm no savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know a person does not do anything, so I visited a number of personalities known, if perhaps be encouraged to apply for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to see Radim Jančura, but refused because he had too much work.</seg>
<seg id="55">For my part, at least I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which brought to light the frauds with light heating oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I applied on the basis that people are really unsatisfied, I'm in the balance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the population went to the polls and those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate we are two independent sector.</seg>
<seg id="59">People chose the Senate, so that will be difficult to achieve changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Are you considering forming his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not seen because I have no time for it to check the unblemished past each potential party members, nor do I have money.</seg>
<seg id="63">No I have no money to campaign for the presidency, in my mind there are only 20,000 crowns transparent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Do not have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">Talk Property statements, how is yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I estimate my private property about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat worth ten million, another apartment valued at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and valued Škoda Superb in a million, and the account I have a couple of million.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time fighting the evils and injustices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do you drive an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say you want to change the republic but do not want to put too much money from you.</seg>
<seg id="71">Not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have not 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Do I have to go into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign I have already 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that it has no sponsor shows that there is much interest in my program.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cover campaign expenses essentially you receive by way of salary senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I could not live on it. For example, I could not pay my child's English School, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I only want to make money, then I would not stand as candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So your business will to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Did not you say before that it would stop this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This has nothing to do with a salary greater.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, in part I left my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">People want to be the Samaritan who would save the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to live for something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much used to earn monthly as an entrepreneur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.</seg>

<seg id="1">The architectural firm MVRDV shows that not only are real adventures in the head - in the example Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I think the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally there is something interesting to do," says Lisette Verhaig a passerby who goes by the street.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, says : "In addition, the building is beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why do we need a library today.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone Internet, tablets and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one gets for nothing in those old-fashioned libraries, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a bedroom community located just outside Rotterdam barely worth a brief visit, has the dubious honor of having claimed a record for forgetting.</seg>
<seg id="8">The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes in the form of decorated concrete thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics :we had to build a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for building fun at the same cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the year contest 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury looked around puzzled and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words : " Dear fellow citizens :</seg>
<seg id="14">Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books Spijkenisse, the so-called ` Boekenberg ' ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the space provided.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is part of the revitalization project, complete with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment buildings and townhouses.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project is also nominated for "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian area and a town hall postmodern incredibly ugly after one intuit white façade rather a dairy, now has a work of architecture contemporary.</seg>
<seg id="20">But mostly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to Book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression is that it is a haven of books under a cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is true that there is an elevator that takes us right into the center of this mountain, but true lovers of reading space and do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of his climb to the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with sight, clinker flooring and elegant lamps unequivocally support the public status of the library.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">Looking up display can reach the park benches, dogs and children playing soccer.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere, books and more books.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the bookshelves are arranged along the front and in the center opens a huge dark room, usually often be uncomfortable and impersonal" says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">What we have done is to shake down the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from inside to outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain is very well used : in the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special mention black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sight, touch and smell are strangers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and civil engineers more daily shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="35">And that's how one day, on a farm Friesland, we stumbled upon the right product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands using a plastic woven few millimeters thick as a base to hold the roots of crops.</seg>
<seg id="37">This material is cheap and efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">This tissue lasts two seasons and then discarded.</seg>
<seg id="39">Library for this fabric was pressed for the first time in such quantities to obtain plates four inches thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes dark material, homogeneous and strong smelling a mixture of new car and sneaker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps leads to the top of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of this continuous path almost 500 meters around the mountain reward awaits us : from the coffee shop not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy a tasty Dutch croquettes and planted ficus in large pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They create a friendly environment whilst maintaining the proper humidity for this mountain of literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Believe it or not given its large glass surfaces, the building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The heating and cooling required are obtained from geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines only for a few hours inside.</seg>
<seg id="48">The massive wooden trusses located transverse to the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">This creates a comfortable indoor climate.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest is up to the shutters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the skeptic sector worker Information Technology, and has dared to set foot in the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">And Lisette Verhaig also been there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "soul late" Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration which took place a few weeks ago, we invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection.</seg>
<seg id="55">This form is to be filled, for the moment, the optical gaps a library that does not yet have its full file, and currently has 70,000.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has deepened.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are full.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think with our initiative now all people have a certain bond with this building.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that the book is part of the library.</seg>
<seg id="61">While only be there for garnish.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV has achieved a success in that discipline reigns in specialized jargon is called "creating an identity."</seg>
<seg id="63">The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">Regardless of how young and uneducated it may be.</seg>
<seg id="65">Finally a starting point to form su identidad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo : "The Germans must play a greater role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S. relations. US - Europe, this places Berlin in a diplomatic position quite tricky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle : Earlier this week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian statehood UN observer.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Berlin finally abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, because of the special relationship between the country with Israel, Germany should beware.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think not endorse the U.S. position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to show his independence without being too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when the issue was to establish a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has been finally declared by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is it hard to Germany take a clear stand when major international issues at stake?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is because right now is shifting its foreign policy away from a policy -led, as it were, by the United States and focusing on German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">And what matters even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="18">They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think they are still probing what their role, but they have already begun the journey to a foreign policy "normal".</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What does it mean specifically a foreign policy "normal" from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions different from those of the United States and its European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, ie exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and that is why Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Do these economic interests have influenced the position taken with respect to the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">For this reason you must be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor the Arab elites.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is important, of course.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not give much importance since it is not a totally one-sided.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, they play a fundamental role in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany Has undermined his relationship with EE. UU. to abstain from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position has a huge degree of understanding.</seg>
<seg id="33">For this reason, I do not think there has been a break as drastic as in the case of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps Germany has achieved thus garner some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the end of the day, all this has done nothing but prove that it is a country that are serious international actor whose interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different views about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, EE. UU. has been shown clearly in favor of a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is there a difference of opinion between EE. UU. and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think the Obama administration secretly shows great insight into the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But because of the political situation that exists here, it is clear that the government can not publicly defend that position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think the real difference of opinion does not really have the scope attached to it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we analyze the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy developed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is it hard to reconcile Germany close relations with Israel and the United States on one side, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there is a coherent and consistent European policy, but not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, do not have the opportunity to be part of a superior being, but must push things from their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is precisely what we are doing now with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think in the future Germany will assume a leadership role when it comes to force Europe to adopt a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply by the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a tricky issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans have understood that they must play the role of independent figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany Will sees itself in the role of major international player? Do you want to actually take a leading role Germany?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or maybe it is still difficult to accept that leadership?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not yet been used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a bigger role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we observe the Euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany is positioned as a major player sets off certain anti-German feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">This is not easy for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">Viewed this way, Germany is in a position much more difficult for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">You must show a positive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of EE. UU. in European politics increasingly decreases, but the EU does not cover the gap at the moment, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will have no choice but to assume a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like, if they find unpleasant or makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stephen Szabo is the Executive Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analyze the challenges facing the transatlantic community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a brand known worldwide, and Polo Ralph Lauren too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind this name hides a designation officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, it is protected while the real eponyms not file a claim.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear that they are going to give the reason.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week comes to my table a new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Imitators just add a couple of letters to register their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this way, becomes Lu Gucci -Gucci and Prada instead of Prada- Kny recorded.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies also copied legally in the same way as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a file in the seats keeping the trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The September 14, 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also served as fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That the Chinese are world champions at it to copy and violating intellectual property rights is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In big cities there are multi-storey department store dedicated exclusively to selling fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, cases are Pattloch other. On behalf of its customers, he struggles against the fact that the trademark office officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "Bang Pai Ming" or mark companion.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word comes from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan"</seg>
<seg id="19">referring to women who have "caught" a rich man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is detrimental to the business, you have to fight it" requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand does not hold water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is huge."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and legal costs in the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euros per year, China is, in size, the third luxury goods market and growing at a faster pace.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registration is complicated and it takes a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Processes can be extended up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the purpose of the application name had already become a "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"If the plaintiff has bad luck, maybe even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the brand of it in China," said Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the best known cases have to do with graphics.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 Daimler - Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer Sany construction machinery, the company was taken over recently by the German manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps.</seg>
<seg id="32">So today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used at first a blue and white logo reminiscent greatly BMW, the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Lacoste clothing manufacturer in China lost against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore which represented a crocodile logo looking in the direction opposite to the original.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The CTMO trademark office in Beijing in 2010 acknowledges that have struggled due to lack of equipment and staffing.</seg>
<seg id="37">Last year, however, "labor emergency situation returned to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, the amount of unprocessed claims process has been reduced by 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, 81,500 claims are still pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To combat this costs a lot of money</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is usual in China, the numbers are striking.</seg>
<seg id="43">CTMO last year registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This would be a new record, and means that China leads the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations worldwide, says the trademark office.</seg>
<seg id="45">It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, rising to 5.5 million in total.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 they bagged 1.800 million yuan in royalties.</seg>
<seg id="47">Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To combat this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For over seven years the group fight in court against a Chinese imitator.</seg>
<seg id="50">While the Germans have failed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,</seg>
<seg id="51">the imitator has been able to ensure Chinese rights over the trademark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the last names are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the people of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the following two instances have given reason to Freudenberg, but the other party is still fighting today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We must be very careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court, which remains pending.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler hopes to favorably resolve the issue and praised the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, it also states that "the process is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."</seg>
<seg id="59">It is difficult to estimate the internal costs, the company has had to file review records of up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Freudenberg five years ago offered to the opposing party a ' six-figure sum in euros "in order to reach an amicable agreement, but was unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This shows how much we care," said Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even affect Europe</seg>
<seg id="63">specifically if there imitators ensure trademark rights unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.</seg>
<seg id="65">Group has long abandoned this trade area, however managed to prevent registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer recommend Pattloch German companies are very cautious of doing business with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">Not enough to rely on international law trademark rights, but you have to do is "China also record anything that might be eligible for protection," as pointed Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, in case you lose the last assault Freudenberg your particular battle, then have to pay the license fees opposing party by name, as explained Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">That or we expel single segment of the market.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Day against AIDS : dance, sing, help</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearses and rejoice Swaziland AIDS orphans</seg>
<seg id="3">The story of a link can be overcome much more than 8,733 miles away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First you start with the dance : cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and loafers look compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">One, two, three, four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only then begin to rise slowly singing voices (alto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, to dull and following one another.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatening to slip out of their boxes almost trying to put order with their energetic and gentle gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology at Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">Have also arrived fifty singers, aged 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the householder.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice choir has a different text and also in a foreign language little known : the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help for self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS worldwide there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million of them live in South Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Over 40% of the population and is HIV positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Voices for Africa Partnership in Germany found sponsors for 180 AIDS orphans Esitjeni village.</seg>
<seg id="17">Seventy of them attend school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">By 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.</seg>
<seg id="19">This contribution covers the school fees, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day in the Gogo Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi in Zulu means "storyteller" the "panegirista."</seg>
<seg id="21">In this room no one can speak the language fluently Bantu, but singing do know.</seg>
<seg id="22">For ten years this choir rehearses songs in this soft language that sometimes manages transport them to their place of origin : South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">At 8,733 miles away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this choir German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent is infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Approximately 2,000 people live there, some even in simple huts of mud and straw, a large part of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">Over 300 and not have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="27">Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the AIDS infection rate highest and lowest life expectancies in the world, according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population frowns circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Over 40% of the people of Swaziland are carriers immunodeficiency virus, and die with more than thirty years has become commonplace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but mostly what they saw were many children on the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing : food, clothing and formation.</seg>
<seg id="31">Untitled school, the possibilities in a poor country are but few.</seg>
<seg id="32">At first it was only a few particular commitment which made it possible for a child off to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, a year later founded the association choir "Voices for Africa" which since then has been engaged professionally AIDS orphans Esitjeni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="37">, Viral STDs are the most common AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pubic lice and scabies are among the ETS -borne parasites.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the case of heterosexual adults sexually transmitted diseases are the most common infections chlamydia, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (yeast) and gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="43">The HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively small, however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections recorded in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections occur in young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to most common diseases among youth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsorily notifiable.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001-3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections remains a downward trend since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 there were about 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is one tenth less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms indicate that it is an STD?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">They often do not cause pain or other symptoms cause and therefore not detected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer one hundred percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and infection by physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">For this reason, experts recommend to have regular checkups, especially if you change sexual partners frequently.</seg>
<seg id="60">If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and may avoid any late consequence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through partnerships, grants, and, last but not least important, the fees charged by the choir for their performances in Germany, come to raise enough money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total we sent ya Esitjeni approximately € 200,000," says Annette proud Lennartz, president of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini woman confident leadership skills and manage money sent from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">It ensures that orphans find good accommodation, for example with a grandmother.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The "gogos" as referred to in Zulu older women are the pillars of the people.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some have up to 14 orphans in their care, they offer a place to live and take care of children to go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman, as are two cooks who are responsible for everyday cooking for 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ice is likely to have a thickness of up to 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there are also ice water as it follows three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".</seg>
<seg id="6">The Messenger probe had found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently shadowed has formed a layer of ice.</seg>
<seg id="7">It seems that it is at least 30 inches and probably even up to 20 meters thick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water comes presumably from comets or, most probably, of asteroids that once collided with Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nobody relates the discovery of ice with the possibility that life exists on the planet, says lead researcher Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the findings may help clarify how they got water and other components of life elsewhere in the solar system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">By completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix is dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Occasionally send images to Earth : small windows to the vastness of space.</seg>
<seg id="14">The image is from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The eight planets in our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.</seg>
<seg id="16">Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not a "planet".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which they appear endless generations of stars : the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, but more difficult to recognize is the pink color of the stars "newborn".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This star-forming region, called unromantic way by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, a distance of 6,500 light-years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This shimmering image of a star in extinction was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.</seg>
<seg id="20">The donut -shaped ring is composed of material that the star spits in the process of extinction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.</seg>
<seg id="22">The NASA Spitzer Space Telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname of "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, with the telescope you can see the colors better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is located 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This rising star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by infrared detectors Spitzer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturn and its rings : how they originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is probably the remains of one of the moons of Saturn that disappeared without trace 4,500 million years ago.</seg>

<seg id="32">One of the largest and most crisp photographs taken by the Hubble telescope : the Whirlpool Galaxy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula found several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name comes from the Latin term Trifid "trifidus" (split into three), as a dark dust lanes divide the hot heart of this star-forming region into three lobes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the constellation Ophiuchus astronomers were able to photograph the evidence of cosmic carom : to 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies merging process pounce towards each other to finish irretrievably crashing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it by the nickname of Southern Pinwheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.</seg>
<seg id="40">The nebula located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles to be found in a house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This image was created from optical and X-ray images made by different telescopes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Displays a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">This group of galaxies called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.</seg>
<seg id="44">Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">This nebula is the group 's brightest young stars of our Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="46">This star-forming region consistently produces new stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In this cloud of stars associated with the Rosette Nebula, also continuously new star arise, at 5,000 light years from Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole still no dust, gas only.</seg>
<seg id="49">The researchers speculate that formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen could find.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our window on the universe : the largest telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later for stargazing.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the optical telescope mirrors has not stopped growing and images we offer are becoming more depth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope located at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">Its mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA. UU., Stands the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">This allows observation of the cosmos through two mirrors, each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - just the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Despite ello, reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The drawback of this construction is cheaper than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so that the mobility is limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The Hobby- Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its uniqueness is its enormous capacity to collect light.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite having a diameter of comparatively smaller mirror, this capacity is comparable to that of the telescopes of the world's largest mirror.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.</seg>
<seg id="65">The telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for short) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">View the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also light the mid-infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The ESO also host the so-called E -ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).</seg>
<seg id="71">Cover primary mirror 42 meters and will comprise a total of 1,000 reflective elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">Until 2018 is not expected to take pictures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">These include two mirrors, each having a diameter of 10 meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which with them exploring the sky with the Subaru Telescope aid and IRTTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">At Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope daunting and mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is an image of what it would be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">From the April 24, 1990 sends images of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of his mission had been located 1,235 candidate planets.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the image you see the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5-2018.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of the Hubble Space has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the functions of this telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The researchers based on the assumption that at the south pole of Mercury also no ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is little evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">For decades radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, now scientists are certain that it is.</seg>

<seg id="7">A search of footprints in a country where people of 97 years are still considered young.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The minibus moving noisily through the winding road that passes by wooded hills, large rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and from here the Iranian border is only a few kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here live the "Talyshi" a town that does not know much, except that perfectly mastered Persian and Azeri and are very long-lived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Our final destination is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">This small town boasts perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit at all in a mountainous landscape so picturesque.</seg>
<seg id="15">European tourists come to this place just because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.</seg>
<seg id="16">To cover the 323 miles between both towns, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.</seg>
<seg id="17">The staggering wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this remote region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to have to become a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became famous in May to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis the place that have more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">One of his sons died at age 136 years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the undisputed star of the museum is the Müslümov Şirali shepherd, who seems to have lived 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, there is no birth certificate to certify it.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that age is pretty suspicious Müslümov.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">He was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time to devise a daughter at the age of 136 years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Have Şirali Müslümov wrong then in his age in a few decades?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide evidence about the age especially there is no general registrar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Everyday glasses filled with melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent, the people of the region located around Lerik typically reach biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">At present there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why live here in the south, many elderly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The tour guide Mugimzadeh Azerbaijani Farid explains that it is ' special genes talyshis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The museum's director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the power.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, from a nutritional standpoint, it just seems logical that a diet rich in calories Talyshi, who love meat, especially bread and dairy products and many of them also drink daily a glass of melted butter as healthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Is she the natural lifestyle that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik Mirzayeva Rubaba lives.</seg>
<seg id="41">In his 97 years is relatively young for what is customary in these latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sitting on the floor, moving tirelessly in a huge tub of butter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people living under one roof, including a son and a daughter Mirzayeva, both became grandparents while.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also jump from one side to the other two small children.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen preparing tea for guests, serving tea in glasses with curved shape typical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Mirzayeva teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark hair reveals her son proud.</seg>
<seg id="48">I have always washed my hair with milk, so I have never been dropped and has kept its color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I have not ever used a shampoo" says Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The pension is enough to live</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">From always eaten alone it produced on his own farm : tomatoes, potatoes and peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">In my entire life I have never gone to the grocery store to a supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then we talk about her husband, who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">The worst was the period after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, everything went back to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Such propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of a woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in Azerbaijan they profess to worship the father figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded to his son Ilham.</seg>
<seg id="59">At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And perhaps the gray son of Mirzayeva is right : "In our culture the elderly are highly respected."</seg>
<seg id="62">They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all necessary care and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">As if that were not reason enough to stay alive many years...</seg>

<seg id="6">" We must overcome the transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">And that happens is my responsibility before the people and before God, "he said on public television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was directed at all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, Muslims and secular Enlightenment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">All of them, until now hopelessly mired in a confusing opposition are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.</seg>
<seg id="11">As Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologetically, has had to temporarily override the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand their own "in order to save the revolution."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, neither the Egyptians nor the world know very well what this 61 year old engineer with a doctorate degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Do you mean to deprive of power to the judiciary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In fact, the 234 items, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly predominantly composed of 100 members Islamists in an evening meeting lasting 15 hours, are truly disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the case is based on the "principles of Islamic law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what does this "principle"?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take this vague formulation, and the legal discretion carries with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is at least suggesting a new article added : in all matters relating to Sharia requires consultation with Al- Azhar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great power throughout Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in incapacitation of the judiciary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the dictatorship of Mubarak served these courts to exercise a crackdown on the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.</seg>
<seg id="24">As prescribed in the draft, the state has to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to promote morals and values."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is so vague formulation in legal terms with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of the film and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Straight Talk is not nothing but censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Certainly no article explicitly states equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">Instead another prohibits offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, it is unclear what is an offense and how it should be punished.</seg>
<seg id="30">Equally questionable is the formulation which prohibits "offending people"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Is it enough a caricature of President or a joke about a lawyer?</seg>
<seg id="32">Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution has come"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For weeks now, the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ten thousand people gathered in a rare harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square in Cario and vowed to derail the Act before it can enter into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution is back and end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the list of the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history".</seg>
<seg id="38">Through Twitter followers accused the Mursi of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".</seg>
<seg id="39">"When convening the referendum will go to his palace and it will bring down," says Jasser Said opponent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We're not tired, the blood of our brothers has not been purged," the media quoted Egyptian opposition politician Ali Chaled.</seg>
<seg id="41">And several judges announced that they wished to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for holding a counter, just in case not in Tahrir Square but after prayer across the Nile, at the University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many women veiled and Salafists supporters took part in it, shouting "the people demand the application of the divine law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Mursi demanded to "cleanse the country", while proclaiming : "the Koran is our constitution".</seg>
<seg id="46">A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all started, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">Clearly Mursi supporters did not want to risk something like that happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The brothers said that both Muslims who oppose the draft constitution as supporters of it have voiced their opinions loud and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now it would be time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should follow.</seg>
<seg id="50">In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"The expression ' human rights ' does not even appear"</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk : more smelly fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is it possible that the country's success bears some relationship to their greed by a very smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a series of over- cured cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty clothes and wet football.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave it there for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can then smell the aroma of rakfisk paralyzing one of the delicacies of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">It snowed. The scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The salted trout rakfisk is left to ferment in water for smelly depending on what you prefer, as a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As it becomes more dark and cold, Norwegians flock to a festival that is held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy as, so to speak, captivating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"It is eaten raw and then drinking a glass of aquavit for a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, City firefighter who is also known as the "General Rakfisk" which is responsible for organizing the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Everywhere we see people eating this fish which is kept in small cubes and sipping a drink significant amounts of drinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people like more the aquavit that rakfisk" says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink can kill the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I try some pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid passing near the nose, not bad, not unlike a lot of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty whipped Norway and in which, before there was refrigeration, fish was kept during the fall submerged in water and salt in sealed barrels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Later, in winter, when it is well fermented, removed, and obviously his senses inactive due to alcohol, eat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is increasing rapidly, over 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.</seg>
<seg id="22">A stream of people of Sweden, the old rival and until not too far richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, though quite smelly, Norway 's past.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is among the most expensive items you can buy.</seg>
<seg id="25">But in fact, everything is expensive. A glass of beer or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10 € ($ 14) each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like to do so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist peppered shot and killed 77 people, among whom were men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22."</seg>
<seg id="29">A lot of Norwegians believe costs them in their peaceful country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 70's, one of the oil and gas world's largest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason we do so well," says Anna, our waitress, while passing trays rakfisk and, with her long blond hair and amazing blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We are, as you say, people cautious."</seg>
<seg id="33">His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We do not like to brag, do not like the glitz".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution, all but a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">While everyone had wasted money over the years that preceded the financial crisis worldwide, Norway kept the wallet securely closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we're happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And eat rakfisk" he adds with a jaunty laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I'm in the snow lining up to eat something, I've had enough rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now elk burger is definitely something different and quite delicious to savor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But at night, becomes the smelly fish.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel where I stay is one of the many venues in which is held rakfisk dinner where diners voted the best fish, or perhaps the more tests the nostrils.</seg>
<seg id="43">A live television connected to a presenter wearing bow tie and surrounded rakfisk dishes.</seg>
<seg id="44">It seems the Eurovision Song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor -Juergen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here is our score, Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There is laughter and applause.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man fell off his chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or perhaps those fumes all that fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexico : Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">As the incoming president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take up his post, the BBC's Will Grant, discusses the challenges that will face the new president and the different expectations of the population.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexico City traffic is especially bad today.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a city that, in the best of circumstances by itself is already congested, has installed a fence on Monday steel cut several of the main roads leading to the city and that is causing massive chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The goal, however, was not to prevent the workers to reach their place of work, but prevent protesters could reach the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, presidential band will take over the management of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He faces a difficult task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against narcotráfco that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto said earlier this week by President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before hobnob with the President of the USA, the previous political experience of Mr. Pena was as governor of his home state of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">A heavily populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital Opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">An honest man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, is remembered fondly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Residents attribute the growth of tourism merit in place and construction of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">To get to the city you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement over the roads cracked and full of potholes that were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="17">You can also see his name plates at the entrance of a modern sports hall and a stunning interactive museum on climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We hope that he gets to make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, deputy party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"Particularly in regard to safety and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="21">Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations of Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also rejects the characterization that the opposition does lack of essence of the new president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">" He's very honest, very committed and excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman, and, above all, is a good listener. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">However, across the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under elevated highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier this year, called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs that operate in neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly acute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a desert land, next to a garbage dump, have been abandoned in just the last two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico as Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Critics say Mr. Peña Nieto, in the best case, which failed to address the problem of femicide while he was in office.</seg>
<seg id="33">Most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a house of concrete, deteriorated typical neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to hold back tears as he shows me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Moon.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, her family believes her partner murdered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I got home, it seemed as if he had cleaned the body," recalls Mrs. Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">"There were signs that he had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana viewed from the walls, along with a cross that reads a single word: Justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">Yet that is exactly what the family says was denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">" State authorities have treated me like an old gossip, a troublemaker, one whiner.</seg>
<seg id="42">What they want is that you simply accept what they say and shut up ".</seg>
<seg id="43">"But that can not be so when there have been so many irregularities and negligence," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico for the past six years and the new president has promised to give priority during his tenure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope it's the same kind of president was when he was governor," said PRI Deputy Olvera Bravo Valley.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Yet that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms do not show any allegations of ill -treatment, even though the officers Manning asked directly about the treatment he received, said Fein.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about some issues and that the officers who visited him had talked about these problems and they had indicated that they would try, but they did not establish these issues in the registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"They wrote ' without incident ' (after having spoken of the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he had not reported his treatment during the meeting held in January 2011 with a council to examine the intentions of suicide he had expressed in a form months before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to get the rate reduction "injury prevention" under which he was.</seg>
<seg id="20">The military said he had been placed under the restrictive regime, which is one degree below the possible suicide surveillance, to ensure their protection and safety of others.</seg>

<seg id="26">"I thought he would die in that cage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico City, had just come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was completely confused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Some signs pointing the way towards two tails : one for "Mexicans" and another for "Aliens".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there a few seconds, not sure which way I should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having grown up in Central California, throughout my life I've been called "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">This is ethnic shorthand, the same way my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".</seg>
<seg id="10">More later I decided to "Mexican - American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the home of my grandfather, shorthand, or scripts were not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="13">Simply was American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle me in an interview in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I have no vocabulary level of a native and I can not get rid of my American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my U.S. passport and got in line for foreigners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought at the time this week that the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the day's agenda, as long as you meet the leaders of these two countries, consisted : immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Peña Nieto was willing to talk also of Mexican economic growth, one of the reasons why right now is as likely to stay in Mexico Mexican as you venture out to go to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Want to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America to EU style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, Peña Nieto vowed to fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, but gave no details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to cede half its territory at gunpoint.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, they think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So, at the time in which a U.S. official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the sons of Moctezuma were put on a war footing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is a challenge is the need of the more than 35 million Mexican - Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">We talk about feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">There's a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the parent or any of the grandparents, which he closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile : dark skin, low educational level, from a poor village, etc..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants and they are loyal.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mexico in.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we can not lose sight of what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty yes it is.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is for the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over his shoulder as if we were in a lower category is not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And now we would not be trapped behind this curtain of silk, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States as a child, I remember that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former more solidly know who they are and this bothers seconds.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are part of neither.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love hearing the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">You get the best of each country, but you're not rooted to any of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we are as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in America we are considered Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, to further complicate things, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want Mexican Americans work as "ambassadors" of Mexico improvised, representing their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We would say to our fellow Americans how fantastic presionaríamos visit that country and political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course...</seg>
<seg id="56">Eso va going on.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is too much bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that is a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear that the Vais getting solos with this idea, folks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Fair enough.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they tried to Mexico for a century and a half, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still bitter about how he treated his family takes much less time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease- fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a basis for peace unlikely</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Amid the usual useless arguments about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But, even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them is changing in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has left everything to pieces like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional uproar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe this will make the fight even more bloody than before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to believe that its deadly stalemate could desencallarse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that neither lost nor gained</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, optimism seems currently very difficult to justify.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if you keep the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure to the 1.7 million Gazans into one of the most miserable and populous, Israel could not destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine now governed by its bitter rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, Hamas leaders might conclude that time is on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since Islamists are gaining influence across the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey resurgent regional power that previously had been the closest Muslim ally Israel, has espoused Hamas. Qatar has also made one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jubilant Hamas members say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where it dominates the party - militia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, to Directions to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Especially in Israel 's southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and important Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his death in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may arise as a protagonist that can not be excluded, even Israel and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, Israeli hardliners will draw the opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">In regards military issue, Hamas have in place.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Iron Dome anti-missile system in Israel has shown its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israelis calmer sleep... for some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever, many European countries also blamed Hamas for having started the latest wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister that has largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets fired from Gaza have claimed the lives of 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part because it corrodes the West Bank barrier, the main piece of a territory aspiring Palestinian statehood, and protect the Jewish settlements continue to rise even though, under international law, are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run up to the elections on January 22, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why pamper giving these twisted Palestinian statehood?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you really govern in the West Bank, did not shoot rockets as they have done their countrymen in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good shot if you raise your head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the imposition of hardliners, but the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the Islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation to Israel, his priority will be to address the internal difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Israeli defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the superpower of the area hardly help new Arab governments to improve their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire bodes well and could be the beginning of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israelis should also think long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, deprive Palestinians of their right to self-determination involves creating a tinderbox that one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded on a bus in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression and is undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the situation worsens demographics with increasing Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years for refusing to pay a toll diplomatic Hamas increasing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a push innocent bystanders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The solution is still touting sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">The hope, small short term, is that the ceasefire give a little extra boost to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, you should start to curb the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.</seg>
<seg id="49">That would do more to create a Palestinian state that the impending attempt to obtain a virtual statehood at the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Obama also has an important role when it comes to getting to bring Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term failed to present its own plan for peace.</seg>
<seg id="52">Back in the White House, seems just as reluctant to devote their attention.</seg>
<seg id="53">This attitude is a deplorable vision.</seg>
<seg id="54">A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="55">This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.</seg>

<seg id="1">The plain packaging law takes effect snuff in Australia</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts look ill on packs of green off, which are the same for all brands of snuff</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Australian law on snuff and plain packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaced the logos and colors of the marks of an envelope of a olive off, some frightening images of body parts and illness representations sick children and babies become children of smoking parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in small font.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the world's strictest rules applied to the packaging of snuff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating features that make this habit has glamor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trust Studies show that if a person has not started smoking before age 26, there is a 99% chance that never will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"You can see that children, even at an early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through your brand," said federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not affect too much of the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies said the law would encourage black market snuff, cigarettes which would be cheaper and more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, the British American Tobacco in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Increase the amount of snuff that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other people say that their business has benefited after the passage of the law.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the packs had shot almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mrs. has said Zico had sold 6,000 units to wholesalers and I was expecting more stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are a good business."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to experts, the potential barrier is the popularity of social networks among demographic sector targeted by the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising and sponsorship of sports and requiring most sellers do not put cigarettes out the snuff marketing has gone done online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned internet advertising to local businesses and web pages, but can not restrict on foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you market as snuff and you just have this small window to promote your products online space is the most compelling in that be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman was an increase in reviews on brands from "ordinary people" posted on social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or a marketing company is behind it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses more on what the new rules mean that in marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recuse themselves the new rules, these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization being unfairly restrict trade, although none of these countries has a volume significant trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">WTO is likely that a ruling in mid- 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries considering similar laws apply in respect of packaging snuff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce compulsory to include images on cigarette packs.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Currently are required in more than 40 countries, which include Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering tougher laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In Australia many smokers are defiant.</seg>
<seg id="32">" Las photographs affect on me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Simply not move me. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"You take the cigar and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while purchasing a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit smoking : for my daughter."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, manager of tight King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform packs do you find most difficult to place them on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Normally desenvalar took an hour delivery, now took four," says Yu.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a constantly connected world, not too bad a bit bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the holidays of Thanksgiving Day this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane they were flying suffered a mechanical problem and had to wait for another plane to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="3">So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the voy a lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Spend half a day in an airport waiting to get a flight is pretty boring, even if you have to be entertaining media such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention the duty- free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But more and more scholars and experts in child development who praise the virtues of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">According to them, it is OK, we and our children, we get bored from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bored forces the brain to find interesting options and may foster creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Given that today, most of us are connected to this or that screen, do not experience the benefits of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So, should we accept in good spirits boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But we'll talk about that later.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">First, like many people, assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, as stated by Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom : A Lively History" ("Boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii there graffiti in Latin on the boredom -century AD</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We must also consider how to define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The problem is that it is defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After reviewing published research and propose the idea to a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desired but can not participate in an activity that fills you up".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="22">He points out that there is apathy desire to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with low mood and a sense that time passes slowly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom may sound terribly like depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood said that although they can be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem is with them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study "The unengaged Mind : Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were sent to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape a person reading a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups in the next room heard a television blaring that bore no relationship, others listened with the volume low, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The group heard at low volume program was more boring than the other two groups focus cost them, but they were not sure why and attributed to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting, impaired attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the study's authors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting faulty parts in a manufacturing line, a music distract you can help you not get bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"In fact, we now know that moving or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat as they make that person is physically more alert".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all know what is bored at some point : the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, especially boring film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people are more prone to boredom than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To help measure, some researchers developed in the 80's a "scale of tendency to boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes questions such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I have not time to do everything."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, teenagers are a group type who gets bored quite easily.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which they came in contact with 400 adolescents and their parents from seven to eight times a day via a pager.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of teens said that he was bored while I was in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when I was in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know if current rates of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels", in large part because both children and adolescents are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, back to my original question : is it good bored?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes it is not, because, taken to extremes, can we expose to physical absurdities, like betting or fall into substance abuse as a way to combat it, as research shows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for over two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is the way for the brain to tell you you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cooking, that will satisfy you.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you watch television, you may be satisfied in the short term but not long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">"So, if your child is bored and give an iPad, you may no longer be bored, but have learned to entertain himself or dosed" said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "that ability dosed applies to other situations," he says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child will not only learn to entertain themselves alone, but learns to control better in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think you really want to praise the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we should not be too critical of him.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable sections of constant rumor and technology activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"In our view, we need more bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing desire to relate it to something worthwhile," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He points out that what people really looking for is a way to unwind and enjoy a full timeout.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."</seg>

<seg id="1">Colorado : no instruction book for the new law on marijuana use</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, 19 year old student at a community college and southeastern Colorado football player, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal in statewide: stones possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Orozco says September 1, he and some friends led by Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors each carry a fine of U.S.$ 100) in which he was informed of the trial date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We try as a criminal," Orozco dice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And you are?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response causes hundreds of minor drug possession less dependent on the law of the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession are canceling both here and in the state of Washington, which passed a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police departments have failed to file charges against those over 21 years for possessing a small scale, to be adopted once the law legally entered into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors Colorado 's most conservative districts have committed to go ahead with the open cases for possession of marijuana and are still citing people.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent marijuana shops open, recently authorized in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All this is changing so fast I do not know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Who is responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington are also mulling over the matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">And still looking for advice on establishing a licensing system for production, manufacture, distribution and sale, all before the deadline arrives, the December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in the regulation of the use of marijuana, first therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Alcohol Control Commission of the State of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"No precedent exists verdadero that serves as a model," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Washington law, called I- 502, entered into force on December 6, leaving also a year during which they will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state not yet exist, but possession will legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues to be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to offer "adequate access" to marijuana and its prohibition authorized to conduct business within cannabis less than 300 meters of schools, parks, play areas and children's centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Nowhere is it more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a recently established research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21, Oates, the Aurora police chief, sent an email to its police officers in which they reported that the city attorney would no longer prosecute minor misdemeanor for possession of marijuana for the elderly 21 and that the police would press charges against these crimes "with immediate effect".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Oates police chief said they would be responsible for enforcing city regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes and would continue chasing smugglers and drug dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the District Attorney Ken Buck, represents a more strict.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said his office would pursue the cases of possession of marijuana, primarily to pressure consumers who decide to receive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, though many of them have other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has an obligation to prosecute against those faults that at the time they occurred were crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on legalizing marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, and does not mention adults for possession of small amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">Pete Hautzinger, county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not think you are wasting your time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, was never considered to take marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">Contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among staff about the great experiment environmentalist in this state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"This is a cultural barrier district attorneys," said Sean McAllister, an attorney representing Denver defendants for possession of marijuana and it's local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Act.</seg>

<seg id="36">Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if Alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases nationwide regarding the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also looking forward to receive indications of the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Department of Justice subsides.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although there have been some outstanding patient arrests and sellers of marijuana for medical purposes, the federal government has allowed most businesses there are selling marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"Although it is likely that drug agents do not pull down doors to seize drug bag small, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated shops for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A.

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt : "I was harassed to kick me out of Oxford to be a Tory"</seg>
<seg id="2">No attacks the university for their views alone now</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Not remember any time in my life in which there have been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, Greek symposium contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization free thought and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, after two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 80s to pursue a degree in History, and had packed, which triggered the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed and began to mourn.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were baffled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper said that I had left because they tolerate some college buddies keep sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">It writer A. N. Wilson announces joking that I had gone because I obligaban drinking cups desconchadas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less fun.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away from there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I fled because he had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that it came from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I harassed for one reason, that the alleged birthplace of the illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric : my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You might ask what is it now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students are suffering similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Institutionalized and growing hatred toward students of the Conservative Party in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights that homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the JCR (undergraduate grouping) of Corpus Christi College say they are "seriously sections often personally attacked and treated as persona non grata" for his political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to create a place on the equal opportunities committee of your college to make sure to express their opinions freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland : Young, Bright and on the Right" (Paradise : young, bright and right) on the politics of the students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">Showed graduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA) in a Rolls- Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with silver handle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, students Conservatives say they are treated as "scapegoats" by the introduction of higher tuition fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Conservative Party, University of Nottingham, told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing trend in universities left.</seg>
<seg id="24">People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a student of history at Corpus Christi who moved the motion for better protection, says that this atmosphere is "uncomfortable" while Cherill Stephanie, 19, is president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude members of the JCR towards people who are center-right has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This is a threat to the environment of intellectual debate and for the welfare of the members," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During my first week in Oxford I was lonelier than one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I entered college in September 1986, was a 18 year old terribly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its peak.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title "honorary" after cuts in higher education funding.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have made you shudder with horror to any Stalinist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Already during the first days of the week to welcome new university when new students are known and known to professors, I received a sample of bitterness than I expected.</seg>
<seg id="33">Professors discovered that not only turned a blind eye to the mockery that was made of conservative academics, but participating in it willingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the wood of the seminar rooms.</seg>
<seg id="35">At first I attended had to be translated into English eighteenth -century French texts and I was not prepared for what came next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">No ni a.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake batter, knew how bad expel bile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Is that the Thatcherite refuse to learn French or is that simply are stupid," he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">The others laughed university.</seg>
<seg id="41">My eyes burned from trying to hold back tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest you go to French classes in their free time, as long as not too busy meeting people," he growled Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Rules to my room like a lost soul.</seg>
<seg id="44">That night I sat alone at dinner time in college, then I felt a gentle pat on the back.</seg>
<seg id="45">He was a student of English sophomore named James who introduced herself as a member of the OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Be who you are," I said gently.</seg>
<seg id="47">" I'm afraid that's how it goes.</seg>
<seg id="48">They go with anyone suspected of being Tory.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is very complicated, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Many newcomers Tories appear to be Labour. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, at a local pub, I tried to cowardly hide.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that he did not agree with everything he said Mrs. Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">That trick was useless.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said : " You are the daughter of a fascist pig.</seg>
<seg id="55">Are contaminated. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students adopted this ditty.</seg>
<seg id="57">I became the dirty pervert.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How the Tories have sex?" Asked one.</seg>
<seg id="59">"They are beating each other, right?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before liberal law 60.</seg>
<seg id="61">Could one day live a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Will I be forced to stay with people who think like me only after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should I make myself Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years that I hoped were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only openly Tory was Professor Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History aimed at my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hated him for being not only the Conservative Party, but Thatcher adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">Just lay Alli.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place that he considered insignificant provincial and adherence to the Marxist view of history - deterministic.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here in the vas to be happy," me dijo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to commute daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and friends metropolitan open minded.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father I hated Oxford and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">In creyó me.</seg>
<seg id="74">When he was studying there in the 40s, were accepted all political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.</seg>
<seg id="76">" They would never do that, not here in my beloved dreaming spiers.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends always had an attitude Communists impeccable. "</seg>
<seg id="78">His aching eyes began to blur.</seg>
<seg id="79">" Give him another chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I'm sure they have only joking.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart if you left. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted of many trips to London, my emotional strength was deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced his creed.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" and called them "old stupid".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The truce did not last long.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I was huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers desisted.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left I packed and caught the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never went back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You may call me weak crybaby.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, not only trained 14 Conservative Party prime ministers but, today, behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="6">This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without their distinguished clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino has always been fascinated by the thin and distant world of the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and pictures abound with the signing of the cream of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by Princess Marie -Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros, porters Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health 70 kilos of sulfur loading by steep stone paths</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom work is hell and one that literally works in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living pulling the volcano Kawah Ijen sulfur, east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">For this you have to go down every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur dioxide gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies on contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After starting sulfur boulders, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, the leads on two bamboo baskets burden on their shoulders through steep rocky paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are just 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2386 meters altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend to a crawl, balancing gingerly and measuring his steps do not slip and fall the precipice.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who plunged years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents per every kilo of sulfur extracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once up, make their way through the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys, laboriously carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.</seg>
<seg id="11">PT is Ngrimbi Candi, a company that since 1960 the volcano explodes and never better, their workers, who pay Rp 662 (five cents) for every kilo of sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then sell it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetic, whitening dynamite and even sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As usual it is loaded 70 kilos, took some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who often make three freight daily.</seg>
<seg id="14">It takes three hours each and just grind, but allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems a pittance for so inhuman effort is triple than you would in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The wages of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the resort island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the pit was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur : "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and have brought Java to convert to Islam".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, constantly coughing and eye irritation by toxic gas</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">At 27 years, Anto has three risking his skin in the Kawah Ijen, sulfur which has already begun to take its toll despite covering her face with a mask and goggles.</seg>
<seg id="20">Have asthma, breathing is difficult, constantly coughing and eye irritation by toxic gases given off the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's the price you pay to get your dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" promises a more than acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished for life, this young man could be sympathetic and intelligent tour guide, waiter or hotel clerk, but instead does the work of a mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing a log cabin unclean with other carriers, gets up every day at two in the morning because sulfur does not stop well at night, when its characteristic yellow color is blue and glows in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadows, lighting their Anto the crater floor with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he bought with his money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some 400 porters carry baskets on their shoulders sulfur from the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite their huge profits, the mining company has no sulfur removal machining to save costs or provide any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and therefore weight.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guardians of this nature come to the tourists who flock to photographing the volcano and their human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the animals and not people," protest Madrusin, a burly porter of 42 years at the Kawah Ijen three decades, since leaving school.</seg>
<seg id="30">Able to lift up to 110 kilos, ensures that endure working "all you can" because he needs the money to educate her three children, aged 18 and 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulfur burning throat and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and the miners trapped in the thick plumes coming out of the volcano, are so hard that no one complains of serious illness... beyond, of course, of his regular breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sore shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing the basket on his back, and can only load Unainik 50 kilos at 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his fellow tear 15 tons of sulfur volcano that three trucks to move Tamansari store, 18 miles away by a goat path in the undergrowth.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I did not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where several teeth missing.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works loading sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from one generation to one of the toughest jobs in the world: the human mules making of Kawah Ijen.</seg>

<seg id="14">So we thought, why not make it as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He who does not take it so lightly is the Singapore government.</seg>
<seg id="17">Spend$ 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to$ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city state and high-tech rich in Southeast Asia, also known by the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate in Singapore, according to their national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was above 2 - called replacement rate - was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why Singaporeans do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, said to be due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, rather than marry and raise a family," he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase of singleness, and delay marriage and births, which results in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy point to dramatically increase immigration to cope with the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia abounds with many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not be integrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the ruling party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and levies for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to build as many houses are not small.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The urban development authority has come to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that they may promote a lifestyle of celibacy and discourage developers who want to build houses large family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company THE Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the larger units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.</seg>
<seg id="40">This makes it much better for our cash flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who put obstacles before them if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">too stressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district seems that they will not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting off," says a young executive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people may have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women report their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, are Singaporeans who have the final word.</seg>

<seg id="5">How to apply this definition in their daily lives and social networks?</seg>
<seg id="6">Do you understand the dangers they are exposed by Internet ventilate situations that probably would not share offline?</seg>
<seg id="7">elPeriódico interviewed five boys aged between ten and 15 years, frequent users of the network.</seg>
<seg id="8">In four cases, associated the term to "something mine," on a personal level, and "in the user name and password", when applied to social networks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My deepest secrets not a post would go up," says Jorge, aged ten, when trying to explain the meaning of private sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They are very secret secrets, my mother can know, but worldwide," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In FB upload pretty pictures or games.</seg>
<seg id="12">I also entertain with my acquaintances.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There would share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is being ridiculous," he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">The child recognizes that bad post obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write reviews humiliating or violent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge says meet the 35 friends you have on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most are related.</seg>
<seg id="17">The mother is included, holds the key to one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I do not know if I answer, I only go up," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or friends quickly," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">No doubt he said never accept an application from an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither would do if someone you recommend to a stranger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of Joseph, aged 14, is different.</seg>
<seg id="24">The teenager has accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask in the latter admits not knowing 20 people added in your list of friends.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I'm not afraid, because we have something in common, eg music," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">According to the boy, none has been suggested and has asked the home address or telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If you pressure me or I simply demand it out of my mind," he admits.</seg>
<seg id="28">Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="30">To an acquaintance of my friend were extorting him on a social network.</seg>
<seg id="31">Threatened him and demanded money.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I never knew who he was," he says.</seg>

<seg id="38">"Although I know that's cyberbullying" he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">key Questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game" he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras says scholar Marc Prensky, Masters in Education from Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">Digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking you have defined criteria about what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say in an age that maturity is not enough for that."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also to be selective when it matters most is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children what is privacy and adolescents is through questions that make them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell him not to no good," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Porras lists some options : There are things you do not would you tell a stranger, why do it online?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, would you like to publish a photo of you as a friend you published?</seg>
<seg id="51">You know what others post about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you tag photos of parties,? Asked permission to others to label them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to show them that they must act on line as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"One out of Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, you should still be on social networks," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">surveillance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Stuart Guard, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential that parents read the policy thoroughly social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account online.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, age and what is permitted to share or publish" he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Guard, is key to the children remember the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, yes, you must learn from Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who attended the Presidential Summit VI Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told TV Peru state that Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but now are practically a homeland".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Defended, in that sense, the project of establishing the South American citizenship that encourage member countries of UNASUR.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors we want to return to the past," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Ecuadorian President was also in favor of the restructuring of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on the rights humans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The chair giving pledge never to anything and instead, we all signed the South Americans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the Human Rights Commission is in Washington on U.S. funding," he said in reference to the given political asylum by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa said he's not regretted that decision because this has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that, at the time, "had reasonable suspicion that Assange be extradited to a third country and respect their process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Also criticized by the Swedish justice required to undergo interrogation into their territory for an alleged sexual offense when "Swedish legislation itself can be done via video conferencing could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration in physical and mental health of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me I had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">What there is the danger of deterioration in his physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without doing outdoor exercises.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That complicates the health of any person," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of a safe-conduct that lets you travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange 's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is doing a series of procedures in different European institutions," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And said "if Britain gives the pass this morning is over."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as well as legislation allows and as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype tomorrow asks just this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took the opportunity to reassert itself as a defender of press freedom and added that it will not tolerate is "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that undermine freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians but the bad journalists by profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In that aspect they are no longer welcomed these journalists "nor the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries which dominate Ecuador", and said that to be reelected "will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until their next election, arguing that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legality coated coup" because actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly well" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua maritime boundary between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment not abide the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between a South American country and one Central.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">You have to process them wide to overcome them and move on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also relied on a good conclusion of litigation maritime boundaries in the same court held Peru and Chile and said "is correct for Latin America seek international organizations if the two countries agree to accept failure hard it is."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Referring to the possibility that as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said he sees that possibility "with optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that if he loses the elections of February 2013 will retire from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Personally never interested me power, but in situations as unjust as the socio-economic poverty Ecuador that can only be corrected by the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement thought it was me who ensured that probable victory, because we have to accept that RESPONSIBILITY" he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">To win would be my last term in office and then went out of public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is a decision," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also referred to the new treatment health of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was planned routine, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It does not mean a relapse into the state of health of President Chavez," he said.</seg>

<seg id="4">The boy hid his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Decided to take one of their illness and began to learn about her, with such efforts already celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, to the director of an IMSS clinic avoided goodbye to him "because he had a cut".</seg>
<seg id="9">So having AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now you can survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, unaware of their disease, yet many people go when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" your immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this point that the survival of a patient initiates timely treatment and survival of the general population, is exactly like,"the head of the HIV Unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infectious disease expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that have patients to start the diagnosis with better expectation for non- drug users : up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50, when they report 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In simple words, this means that the person receiving the HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, under these terms "while you keep in control can live without problems until 75 years," said the interviewee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To measure this progress, remember that life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">They get tested, if they had risk, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if you have the diagnosis, you learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ratified by an appeals court of the United States a judgment which ignores the debt restructuring of Grupo Vitro via a bankruptcy achieved in Mexico, the stage sets an ominous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country with solvency problems.</seg>

<seg id="2">It seems, then, that the proceedings in support of survival of firms allow Mexican law are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, against the international conventions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In practical terms, the endorsement of the ruling issued last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, left helpless Mexican firms face the possibility of seizure of their properties beyond Bravo.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">However, the decision opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Input, while the trial judge noted that creditors must abide by the Bankruptcy of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main action is handled in bankruptcy Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would ignore international procedural cooperation in insolvency transnational companies profiled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, to this end created the United Nations Model Law on Uniform International Commercial Law, standing as an arbitrator by the American Law Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="10">In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompany endorsed the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The truth also is that subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, anyway Vitro 's creditors who fought it in the courts of the United States, ie the "vulture" funds as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, have not achieved majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The figure omits the Court of Appeals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another angle, it blames Vitro of the difficult situation faced sideways from 2008 to the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the tail to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For now, the family firm Sada Gonzalez will lodge an appeal before the appellate court itself that the vote comes to the floor of it, ie the five judges, as voted only three.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="17">Not successful this resource will be claimed will make sure that the process requires a review by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The worst part is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the form of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which is the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Bankruptcy Law commercial, noting that it is vented with adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Globetrotters basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was over 60 years tabloncillo linked to sport and, thanks to him, traveled the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of local basketball history as broad as is Hector "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And is that before stroke confine him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years as a player was smaller categories, National Superior Basketball player, agent and leader in the BSN with Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was chairman of BSN, general manager and president of the National Team during the 90 federative" recalled Reyes during a visit of First Time to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Elizabeth, his faithful wife for over 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball has been my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes does not exaggerate to make that assertion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his home, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias denoting his long career, testify to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In all, more emotion treasured are those that recall its way through the Cowboys since the mid- 50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or possession of the franchise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, either as agent, coapoderado or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of satisfaction, including five consecutive championships from 1971-1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Mincy in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thereafter he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), I said : "I have a player you tight, 6 ' 7" tall.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want it? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that have had Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse sniper who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember him saying that if he had given Mincy championship Bayamon, Gausse help bring another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but because of the distance, because for 1988 and federal honcho figured.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time preferred to enjoy their accomplishments and those of Mincy in the National Team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we won for the first time to the United States in the 1989 Olympic Qualifying in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and bronze should have been but for that Canadian referee made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Is that World Cup 1990 group is the best national team you've seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him a beating the U.S. team, which was quite similar to that we won bronze at the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">That team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter Young, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that maybe was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying in Neuquen, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With role players as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the suspended players for the mess of the Pan de Mar del Plata, won gold against all odds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without a doubt, this has been Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His numbers at international tournaments are awesome.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as did Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to mention his experience in different leagues he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who has been the best Puerto Rican coach?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good litter including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From young, I love the work of Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What was I to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things I had wanted to implement, such as regionalization of the smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, Ponce boys only play in your area and only faced teams from other parts of the Island in the national playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Right now children ride and play too unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the fruit of Compulsory certifications and course leaders, table officials and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">Eso me complace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy me my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.</seg>
<seg id="49">And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.</seg>
