<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to hinder Obama ’ s reelection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justified its policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and affirms that electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die because of the fall of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Indeed, the lawyers Republicans have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: These new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">In that regard, these measures will undermine in part the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Contrary to what happens in Canada, the US states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in the same vein a majority of governments Americans enacted, from 2009, new laws that hinder the process of registration or vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has spread after the elections of November 2010, who saw the rise of 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently, during the year 2011 180 were introduced draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require that voters submit a photo identification, in addition to a test of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, these laws reduced periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election and withdraw their right to vote to people with criminal records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006, no American state demanded that voters should submit a photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="14">The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore, the republican authorities rushed to extend it to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In recent years these authorities have supported bills 34 states to compel voters to submit a photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to keep in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, as the Social Security card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, have no photo ID issued by a government agency of his condition.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those features.</seg>
<seg id="21">But often, obtaining identity documents required costs more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thus, the new restrictions affect disproportionately affects young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of the people over 65 and 20% of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years do not have a photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And there are still more.</seg>
<seg id="25">In many states students, most voters to vote Democratic candidates, they cannot use the photo ID issued by your institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, these same states authorize the members of the clubs of fishing or hunting that tend to vote Republican parties to use the documents issued by the clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004 no state demanded proof of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state to submit this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that are U.S. citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly limit the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws abolishing the registration of voters on the day of the election in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, restricted the right of individuals and groups to create a service of helps voters who would like to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, in the 2004 general election, the campaigns of registration of voters contributed to the registration of around 10 million people.</seg>
<seg id="36">Measures taken since 2009 put the rate of registration of new voters will fall in 2010 compared with the year 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that contribute to the reduction of the vote in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were African American, while the latter did not represent more than 13% of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the case of Hispanics was exactly the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">These represent no more than 11 per cent of the electorate, which amounts to a 24% of citizens who vote in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">However, whites, representing 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, the congressional Democrats and their supporters have protested strongly to the adoption of laws that restrict the register of electors.</seg>
<seg id="43">In this regard, the governors Democrats have blocked several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Public Prosecutor of the United States intervened to suspend the laws more controversial.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was, in part, to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that required the submission of a photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics Democrats denounced the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that with these aims to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report by the Brennan Center 2011 shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college for the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with any certainty whether these legislative changes to scale of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">One thing is certain: These new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this regard, the measures will undermine in part the American democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostate cancer screening: Let the Going test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the PSA test is sometimes inaccurate results with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided that unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a good enough reason for wavering men, already reluctant itself, as to whether they should be made or not screening tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do Going the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have sought advice from two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies in the United States was detected a high rate of infection among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make recommendations firm.</seg>
<seg id="7">For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients who had made the detection and those who do not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study, with up to 12 years, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if it has not been conducted the tests.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend to 50 years, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">African American men have a higher risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is truly necessary to achieve the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. He must provide all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that does not vitiate the life in the long term, in which case you should opt instead for an active monitoring of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men who were detected cancer are not treated, given that the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to his life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, we suggest an active monitoring of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer a treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“We find increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I recommend that the test in any case.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not the test must be done.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Preventing the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of the investigation, the adoption of healthy choices remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We believe that if everyone ate well and move enough, could be prevented a 30 per cent of cancers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If nobody smoke, this rate would, at least, to 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Instead, we assess that about 10 percent of cancers are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many others remain totally inexplicable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Tobacco is linked to 85 per cent of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is a risk factor for other types of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Greatly jeopardizes the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today, there are still 1.5 billion smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">A hopeful: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Fat and obesity are also conducive to the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, pancreas, oesophagus and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The agency recommends also limit consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In large quantities, climb the risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">Meat products must also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of meat for smoking, curing or salted can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"May damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", we explain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, scientists have studied the link between vitamin complexes and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, by the time its research is inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SCC, Ségou studies of vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what took place was, rather, an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not been able to determine clearly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talk about the concerns and the family history of each with their doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Detection test does not cause cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs bosón in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosón generated a shock last summer, and rightly so.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that this bosón joins in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.</seg>
<seg id="4">What is more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model: Our best or "less bad" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the field, which has not yet been observed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for physicists is not totally clear question of Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and very much like the Higgs bosón predicted by the Standard Model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data unveiled this week in a physics major conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, while more data to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem few. We will see what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this great world, a law and inescapable that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no way of breaking the rule and not try too, because it will end up doing harm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, has shown that there is also a law of these features: The principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles may not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same state "quantum"; a "state" consisting basically of some of its features.</seg>
<seg id="12">Physicists classified particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists that has no respect for anything, or at least not by this principle, which means that can be found in the same place, at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the website The Particle Adventure Laboratories Berkeley who, incidentally, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: The taverns, of which we do not here, and the "force particles," for which the major forces of nature and spread with which the Higgs bosón would somehow related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons, it should be underlined here, are not the exotic creatures that might believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">Indeed, if it is able to read this report, it is thanks to an extraordinarily bosón banal: The photon or the "particle of light" acting as "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or change of direction, "mess up" the electromagnetic field in that very environment; a bit like when we launched a stone to a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is to say, one of the bosons "bearers of force."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies to the Higgs bosón, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disorderly" for this bosón appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it needed to extremely high energies, a little as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">Why do we need a huge particle accelerator as the CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 kilometers in circumference!) to achieve such energy levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relation between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">Indeed, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, they do, but others do not: A piece of paper, for example, will not by itself never attached to the door of a refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), they are not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, what "can make all these investigations?", asked Mrs Plamondon.</seg>
<seg id="29">For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and may, moreover, that physicists escrutinen differences between observations and predictions of MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">For its part, many are strongly desire, as the minor difference could open a door to a new "physical" that tape some holes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, it must be said, still has huge gaps, as it does not propose any explanation on the seriousness (ups!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the area of the Universe (another ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of such research in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe we are wrong to say that will not have any.</seg>
<seg id="35">To see: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories are not suspected in the revolution that would work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where they invented the laser in 1960, and that developed the first laser (the former were down) in 1962, the laser was considered a "laboratory apparatus."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition, the application can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light sensor in 1969 in the course of research in the field of lenses.</seg>
<seg id="41">Despite that was not at all its original intention, this sensor now serves as a "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Dignity in Dying in your Commission, Québec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be adopted soon as he prepares a draft law.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, within that domain essential, there is still much to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has attempted to see it closely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment of the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer that was destroying had given him a break of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was given five years of life, but I have been so seven", recounts, made a pass, lying in bed in the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, arrived at by the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this," continues.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has wreaked havoc: An enormous weakness which prevents him from go only to the bathroom and even eat alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, resigned acceptance that help you eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brave, even to smile, to speak with the strangers who devote attention, these medicines and offer a bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My fondest wish is that I heal diarrhoea, is humiliating," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team found remedy that evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes pee standing," recounts Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the centre Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Return to their childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That depends on the ability of the person to accept this retreat," notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, according to the opinion of the majority of people working in palliative care, the great moments take place at the heart of this regression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">All patients who enter the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecast of life have a maximum of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative care."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The biggest fear of Ms. A., 89 years, is dying "aware and drowned out."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has made you discover their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have some good children," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Since I have no more wishes in this life," he says, before accepting that placed a mask to help her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">And expected in the coming days, a last visit of his son living in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps food.</seg>
<seg id="29">Palliative care are being given when nothing more can be done.</seg>
<seg id="30">To help his death is more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Québec have a bed of palliative care for each 11,700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, because we know that all we will end up dying one day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors from the centre.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The moribund will offer shenanigans of mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="36">To diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">The death is part of the everyday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening we serve a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, her son was completed beer at the foot of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We both patients and their loved ones," recounts Nathalie Savard, director of care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without never be the same.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to a man from 94 to eat his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed in their pillows while all drink to your health, a young 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, having tried everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For six months, there are always three to five beds were occupied by people under the age of 45 years suffering from cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients are admitted to the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his home and 47% of hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives in the terminal stage of life, is at his home, in the hospital or a care centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several agencies, such as the centre Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home, the Grand Montreal specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is precisely this great lack relative in health care of Quebec which makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent persons of palliative care, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthcare system of Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has a right to palliative care quality before they accept to proceed with euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Recently," recounts, "I have seen a patient to 14 days in Emergency suffer severe pain without that has been done to alleviate it.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive proper care. "</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, many oncologists have mixed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.</seg>
<seg id="54">The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already at a low ebb when left a tiring chemotherapy treatment.</seg>
<seg id="55">"When I told my oncóloga who wanted to stop treatment, she told me that gave it a pity that I would like to stop fighting," recounts.</seg>
<seg id="56">"However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no care all-powerful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking die thank carers to which they are treated in their demands once they have been eased their pain, thanks to a team of palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful as regards the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatment against the pain in 8 per cent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, whether sporadically or permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Increasingly, the disease is relieved not to be able to have that palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are not relieved say all the same: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not necessarily mean "I euthanasia", but "I want I ease."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="4">"It is curious how the system is sprayed once we hunted to big media," observes Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.</seg>
<seg id="5">He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the misappropriation linked to contracts of roads in Quebec, the liberal prime minister in that time, Jean Charest, had not consented only to delay.</seg>
<seg id="6">The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts", containing some of their instincts to stay with a proportionate share.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Commission Charbonneau "has already caused two mayors," adds, while hopes to reach "demonstrate the existing manoeuvring behind individuals."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A permanent unit anticorruption, created in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The permanent anticorruption Unit, established in 2011, also applies to his team of inspectors, investigators and analysts from the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">This unit works in addition to the police for "the squad Marteau", which, since 2009, have made the "cartel of sewage Montreal" moderate to inflate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to registration in number of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal office as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town in the suburbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, just step down as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">Suspected to have pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has indicted engineers of the road network of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter has caused commotion explaining to the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">He paid for three years a 3 per cent of the value of the contracts in Montreal to a middleman linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">M. Zambito distributed money left, right and centre during the years 2000, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, he admitted to having organized a collection of illegal funds for the ex-deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau liberal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Inflation in the cost of sewer contracts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, it perfectly before the committee: In 10 years received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, fixtures of hockey and bribes from companies in the construction sector totalling $736,000, all in exchange for contracts of sewage inflated costs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials of the road network has admitted receiving money by inflating bills between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in concept of false extras.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately have turned a blind eye to a budget parallel and filled their coffers of dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to Montreal to a huge crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Smooth was one of the first elected political Montreal sounded the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">As mayor of the district of rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island since 2010, objected to the sale of a city land acquired by $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to promoters in the housing boom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of the money of electoral campaigns was dirty money</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The investigation that eventually will be held, it ensures that strip "of a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".</seg>
<seg id="30">And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."</seg>
<seg id="31">We are preparing the wounds but would require a research unit cleans in Montreal and be very vigilant to the dubious practices are not repeated.</seg>
<seg id="32">How do the cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declared that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned mainly by the role of the '"elected politicians abreast of the ploy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Believing in a 70 per cent of dirty money that went to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, observes: "I have been told that this is no more than a pale reflection of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations to political parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while not strictly limited electoral expenses, dirty money in politics."</seg>
<seg id="37">Recommends a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot fall lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this history tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who desire to take a look in the mirror.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How would explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">Could be explained by an individual consciousness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">They have great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">I advance daily at his side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff also has given me a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">And these elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a game, that is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is going very fast in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not acaloro.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my early in the centre of with of INF Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Will benefit from competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">The recruited this summer are used to play games of very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know that every training is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">That makes a player as I would like to fight and give everything.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">Backed by attached as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti does is the man who needed the team?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, there is no one in the League 1 and is among the best coaches Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that will be other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a conversation with him very reassuring.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had just emerged from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that takes me also explains my good performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What does he think about the PSG in the first part of the season?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the League 1, Lyon has removed the leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we remain in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our greatest objectives is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarterfinals with style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the objective of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, you can do anything.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we have a lot to say on many and very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want, for starters, finishing the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the return of happenings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Does the PSG can become a great European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">Already has the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and being there in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the economic level, the GSP is handed over to their means to this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not win the cup in the League 1, like last season, would be a great failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we will invest all our efforts in lead that title of champions.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season does not get far.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we have been a disappointment, because we had the best conditions to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had a strong season.</seg>
<seg id="49">Finish with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points should have been champions...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, the Montpellier, had a season rather better.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year I think that will be the good.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the major equipment like the Marseille, Lyon and the Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe that we have the weapons to llevárnoslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expect more PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal to wait a lot of us if we believe in what has been invested in the players that we have.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have accepted.</seg>
<seg id="57">After that we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, still with things to reproach ourselves is a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what more expected people.</seg>
<seg id="59">We can never win 4-0 every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to launch a project of game.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League, we have shown that we can respond and be present.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at the Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to qualify, and they have also invested a lot!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the sums invested, imaginaríamos with 15 points ahead of the day.</seg>
<seg id="66">That would be to neglect our adversaries and the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, had been "driven" by this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the League 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we finished leading the trophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG is entirely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Has come to demonstrate that it is the star of the League 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">And he has shown in all the teams in the past that is a great player, a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group that we respect the man and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">And he also respects to men who has around them.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">That pushes the others to increase their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of the world, also enables all progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How do you lived Euro 2012 with the team of France?</seg>
<seg id="81">It has been a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I was very excited to participate in this match.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury I kept accumulating game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">VI things there and I strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today achievement play good parties in the selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">What is expected from my baptism with the "blue".</seg>
<seg id="87">We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we now have an exemplary behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What image you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "blue"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Is producing results.</seg>
<seg id="90">Are well positioned in the World Cup qualifying group.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win.</seg>
<seg id="92">As was the case of Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want to make comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc achieved its aim to end to the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will take the selection to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Does the tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the foundation?</seg>
<seg id="97">That game gave us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought by all.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Quite the contrary to current monetary exchanges, based in central banks, the transactions identified and the burdens of processing between the parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system composed of monopolies, banking, financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at once a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol for change to the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">There have been nearly 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">And nearly a thousand websites accept the bitcoins as gifts or as a form of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The value of the bitcoin, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later today, before returning to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Is nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or in financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) enquired about him in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">In it, he described the bitcoin as "the most successful" virtual currency, "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as the "credits", used to move forward in a video game and you can earn playing or you can buy (and even sometimes redeem).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But in any exchange a central authority controls and is the changes.</seg>
<seg id="14">With bitcoin, all network nodes are both repositories of books, verifiers, issuers of currency and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of email.</seg>
<seg id="17">A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information linked to this transaction was signing electronically through a system of double encryption key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins is contained in the book of public accounts, which is disseminated throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key milestone is to write the new settlement in that book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This goes through the resolution of a challenge to computers and mathematical launched the winner, a kind of central banker provisional, will have the privilege of adding that line complementary.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a file cut up phase, i.e. transformation of a large file in a shorter and unique digital footprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" the whole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find the number that offers a particular (more zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number, the other nodes readily verified that is good.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any change would change the mark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, to commit fraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network will accept as valid only one of the two transactions; the other would be an orphan, as both have different tracks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that will solve the challenge is 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, the reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but are divisible until cienmillonésimo, leaving a large margin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of that challenge is also reveals in every increase of computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network already has its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed bitcoins in deposit.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The ruling does not affect the same protocol used," says Pierre Noizat, which just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB takes into account the possibilities of blanquo money through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the cash presents the same defect.</seg>
<seg id="38">Actors such as Wikipedia reject such payments.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the platform Wordpress, the accepted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the accounting and book showed that almost 80 per cent of bitcoins does not circulate.</seg>
<seg id="41">Launched in November, the giant "cuts".</seg>
<seg id="42">"$30,000 were changed," rejoiceth Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul bitcoins, which converts the gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, author of a book on the currency, believes in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">Your system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a payment by mobile without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The bearer, moreover, manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to launch in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simply provide a direction that a phone can recognize and photographing "," said Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement of revision of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take a while to Bitcoin imposed, but in 2013 could be a change," predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Furthermore, in its report the ECB expected revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this currency success.</seg>

<seg id="5">It is time that the Afghan army take possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without expecting anything to us.</seg>

<seg id="7">And to ourselves, to our 88 soldiers killed, wounded and maimed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id="9">Want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if its causes joined the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they are no longer when Westerners are more discreet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The departure of the French troops of the basis of Nijrab, that I noted from the top of the hills of almond trees planted by credits French, it was in order.</seg>
<seg id="12">The convoys of trucks and tank returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by helicopters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances have changed since its irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was then vacuum and the country involved in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of its peasants overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation was no better.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.</seg>
<seg id="19">Leading figures of the war anti-Soviet returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">Have become speculators, seizing government lands for resale as solar refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the couple of enormous American outsourcing contracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Are discredited; most of them have struggled.</seg>
<seg id="22">People, as I have heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, as will those who take advantage of the American generosity: Capital flight is considerable.</seg>

<seg id="31">Is it considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country?</seg>
<seg id="32">The former commanders of the fight anti-Soviet worry provincial militias to reconstitute already fleeing the central power.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, deleting the post of prime minister who has existed since the Constitution of 1964.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai is not to foreign control, in particular during elections scheduled in April 2014.</seg>

<seg id="36">No industry has restored its services, has not been solved any have been repaired or reservoir irrigation systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority is to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country ruined after 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to government control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Spread the rumour that Afghanistan had vast mineral wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">And that only added to the sense that Westerners were there to seize them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy to extract minerals iron or copper terrain and without any means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese almost have left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) excaven the immense site búdico and remain there as employers more important of the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country of extensive reliance on imports and exports, restore their normal relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">French troops left on 20 November.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new treaty of cooperation envisages the continuation of traditional assistance: Girls schools, colleges of children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the areas of military, legal, health and agricultural and support to the archaeological delegation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "winning hearts and spirits" and make the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions match, a service of civilian and military actions "" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French NGO extensively in the collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of locations in mountain.</seg>

<seg id="8">To his opponents, the president continues with its autocratic delusions "and" continues "betraying his word" and "trampling the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">By his supporters, ensures that it is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the next 15 days should be organized a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which requires the Brothers to renounce its draft explain the text article by article, the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way of regaining a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians vote in favour, as stated in an interview with the weekly American Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or vote my text or take the full powers," supposedly powers will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in this strange atmosphere in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist in their great majority, voted the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of Liberals did not go to the call.</seg>
<seg id="17">In November, a little before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they believed that they could not assert their points of view.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">To make the necessary quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, replacements, hastily.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">As expected, the articles have been adopted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically to the sentence, so much so that members of the committee came to believe that the Constituent clock was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was still being voted yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2, under the spotlight, remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of the Shariah constitute the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, would hopefully be able to replace "principles" by "rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of its goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liberals the label of hypocrisy and believe that it is no more than a marketing trick.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They concern, in particular, article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University a consultative role, especially for anyone who has confirmed its compliance with the laws of the Shariah.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, is disturbing because "people call to pronounce is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here we see the premises of a theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Fears of liberals were further augmented by the fact that the next rector of the university would be far less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For now, there is a particular religious involvement.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution we are in the context of marital status.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some of them trained in the French system, "explains Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But recognizes that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, because the language imitate vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We refer in particular to the term iqh [can], Islamic jurisprudence.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the question that might arise in the future would be the extent to which the civilian judges are competent to rule over all of this. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism that relate to the widespread powers given to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that few compared with those who were during the previous regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another sticking point: The powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to the desire of the military, the budget review of Defence will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national council of defence.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nor shall prohibit the prosecution of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the partnerships for the defence of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which considered liberticidal.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, with potentially grave consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not included in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Although the Egyptian president should leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of State demonstrated on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The big and powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While Members and human rights defenders argue about the impact of the law on the mandatory review, have already appeared in the country tricksters dealing with certificates "false"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other Russian cities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of countries of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its sole objective is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since 1 December enters into force a law, according to which each migrant labour should conduct a review to test their knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention to work in the service sector institutions, community service, domestic services and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, over time, as promised in the Federal Migration Service, examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it will not be enough to pay the review of the language, but also the of Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language they must confirm even to receive and renew the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exceptions include the citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Will not be subject to this law people who succeeded in obtaining their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Utility, fate and defence of human rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of centres reviewers will operate under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute of Pushkin, the Peoples Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher learning Russian.</seg>
<seg id="15">Immigrants may be submitted in evidence in all the cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 such centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="17">But defenders of human rights, long before the law came into force, they often put this question to the press: What will this in reality?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes will bring the binding nature of the knowledge of the language, for both the Russians and the immigrants themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Firstly, the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labour".</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people speak today on the defence of the rights of migrants work, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">The defence of their rights must be initiated prior to his departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of selection organized will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or spend the medical supervision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding of the language, the future, says Sebelev immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, "put a paid trip to a" shocking and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We received a number of complaints of our immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In his homeland promise them a thing, but were deceived, deprived of their passports, wages are not paid promised," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Immigration Service labour immigration of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">It is not angry, jefecito!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which seek to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: Few Turkoman, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone calzarlos dressing, and buy back to school.</seg>
<seg id="31">To reach adolescence, these guys venturing to work at the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if we do not know the language, recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and lower."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, as regards the law on the tongue, human rights advocates point to an important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have this status, there will be no consideration and, accordingly, no formal work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome or prevented from strangers"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many visitors claim that receive official status in our country is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The case is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the legalization costs money: Twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, a false registration can be done quickly and only 500 roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, we are not registered and appear cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea," commented to journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, do not be stingy, bought a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The first day of the entry into force of the Act on the tongue, revealed that not only the registration documents of immigrants can be false.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several false "certified" knowledge of the language have already been seized by officers of the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="48">The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, arrived at the hands of the new owners not as gift: Each immigrant queriéndose facilitate the task of the evidence, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is two and a half times more expensive than the formal process of review, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption to the "diplomas are not" can buy, converge government officials and defenders of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="52">So far, the authorities can promise to migrant workers who had not been able to successfully pass the review the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.</seg>

<seg id="1">Go on strike employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in US</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Up to a quarter of young Americans find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald 's"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, in the United States has started a wave of protests against the low wages paid in supermarkets in the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald 's", "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy' s" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For now, no one dares to say whether or not he will arrive this wave to the nine points, or if you have meant losing forces and amansarse in its early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Protest actions are supported by the trade unions and of a number of NGOs on the left.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the modest salaries earned by workers of Walmart and the fast food system, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions of workers in these companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Do and six cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The shares began last week after Thanksgiving, called "Black Friday". That day, in United States coomenzaba the orgy of rebates that captured million inhabitants, and sometimes was accompanied by fighting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">That day, some workers of the corporation Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and picketed protest together with the trade unions and activists of the left in the shops of the corporation, whose products are directed at people with modest incomes and moderates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in their shops are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than the larger supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many workers underpaid Walmart buy only at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and assortment of products made of Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the words two critical, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low price, in part because pays little to their workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklift or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The "Black Friday" participants in the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation from 30 to 100 dollars per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">For a typical worker Walmart, which receives $9.5 per hour, this is excessive spending, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the company $3.2 trillion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is approximately 1.1 per cent more than it spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart placed wage increases in the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will only 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $has more than they spend now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that did not cause any loss to the corporation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "Black Friday" continued in their tents from 8 pm Thursday until midnight on the following day and, during this time, Walmart sold around 5,000 articles per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total, their cash registers undertook the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the website of the left Huffington Post, who left his job "less than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest had not been more than another trick "public relations", organized by the union workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"¡Fund free!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not department stores Walmart (which in this progressive city have no appreciation, and why now there are none), but the "McDonald 's" cheap and other restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">¡McDonald 's said that sold billions of pieces, and then even give you sick and you pay for your work honest!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, according to the federal law and of New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fast food restaurants will grow over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York $8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody earns less than them in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible to survive in New York with this money, for me it is incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when almost a quarter of teenagers Americans went through the McDonald 's and worked there, behind the counters, part time after school, although still living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, constantly setback in some interviews with workers from McDonald 's who complain that they live in this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine is a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know how to eat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 Thursday morning in the McDonald 's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that ATMs and fast food cooks are starting to pay at least $15.00 per hour, or that they will double its current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that the fast food industry is the establishment of trade unions of workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The law prohibits the US administration prevent them from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with chicanery and redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration seldom provides them with life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But, for objective reasons, it is easy to unions cover the food sector rápid.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main mechanisms is the excessive staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Dissenting</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald 's located near Times Square, which included a number of local Democratic politicians, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald' s said that is selling billions of pieces, and then even gives you a hospital or you pay for your work honest."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported by other prominent democrats in New York, for example of the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the fast food workers to receive fair wages and economic prosperity that deserves every NY."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest demonstration of this kind in American history of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it took only a few hundred people, including not all of them were employees of the service of fast food, where trabakan tens of thousands of New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not clear whether this will spark to trigger a mass movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"For now, deceive the brain is not so easy"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The issue of augmented reality, so popular among fans to modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal mainly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer, in its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in movement and later, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the relevant patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technology in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, determined that for scientists of that company, it belonged to a bygone era.</seg>
<seg id="5">They lured the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We specialise in-person interaction computer, but in addition we seek to expand the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">By now the great mass has been caught in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes plays with the finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox Kinect sensors and represent a step forward and today sold without any Xbox Kinect, because we all have a stake in the gesture control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- what the future holds?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite Kinect has led the interaction at the physical level, much of it still occurs in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the exit is still not very good.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, we work in 3D, truly visualization systems based on different technologies, including the design.</seg>
<seg id="15">It must rid the world of informatics to ours, the physicist, make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also his surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Firstly, the devil with these stupid helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about the control by voice?</seg>
<seg id="20">A very popular, but do you not believe that we overestimate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It can be seen as a panacea, remains of resolving the issue of privacy, if not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think of gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">For now is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, overall, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- how is that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how I would ask you to forward this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will speak and the show at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- normally I only speak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- Or is, you want to oblige users to adjust to what can or cannot do at this time the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Not necessarily, but is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="34">I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.</seg>
<seg id="35">These may be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If we talk about his work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have of the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with 3D recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get 8 Megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the issue is not in the Megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From this point of view, all existing technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to designers of algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to remember not only the resolution on X and Y axes, but also in Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory in Redmond, made an adjustable delay contact sensor processing of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in number is closer to the second value (60-100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the man-machine interaction.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require that the contact for more frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">“But it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The Kinect now has three "" cameras, one of which is in fact the issuer of infrared and the second recipient of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the third camera is actually a simple sensor pitch visible.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or rather, expanded and enhance the required amount of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be a good idea to create a similar flexible Kinect, playing with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help determinr dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted their glasses to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, all the while hold a smartphone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: The best option would be a "augmented reality" transmutable when, on the basis of a platform of cloud, you could spend of glasses, the smartphone</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (private only things you can see them), but also their weakness: An augmented reality based on glasses not permitted to work on virtual objects together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem in this idea that critics often noted: No reply touch!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands do not feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What responses prepares its group for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures often say that augmented reality is the seventh eruption in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I believe that the 8th could well be the addition of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, one of the more interesting is the use of the second hand as support for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">¡Register touch perfectly!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are truly aimed to contribute to these tangible "images in the air". For example, the interference of several rays ultrasonic aimed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to that one feels if somebody was soplándole at their fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets for the doll that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to deceive the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Do you think that he feels it seems that should feel when you see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- That is a good idea, yet we have not tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located within a very short believes that goes to an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not as gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of the giant balloons.</seg>
<seg id="73">For now, deceive the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is what makes it attractive working with virtual reality to investigators, that many things are in a state of total conception.</seg>

<seg id="19">I realised that this was my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">I became a friend of artists of the new wave, with the subsequent to those set out in Gaza and front, which led to "Pushkinskaya 10-" is over, and the new wave.</seg>
<seg id="22">I sumí in theatre by clothing, music of all genres, but not by the letters.</seg>

<seg id="23"> - And what is for you in your Clinic of art... - For me it was important to stand in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where they had to meet the best creative minds.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reforms, there was an artistic club music club, a bohemian, the house of bohemia of St. Petersburg.</seg>

<seg id="38"> - Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed today and the occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns are a timeless category.</seg>
<seg id="41">I was once sociable, but now it is painful and terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clowns everything is embadurna and tragedy is removed.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the salvation of the world through a compulsory totalitarian and change of clothes.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now you are by clothing, moving on the outside, but inside the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">And, perhaps this person he or she should not give the hand, but spit on him in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And deceit will be deleted when you change of clothes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - Recently saw we thee in the role of urban right. - A cultured city must have a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who better than I am to be!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Well but perhaps commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.</seg>
<seg id="52">We are witnessing the collapse of cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before people were grouped in herds, the bohemians wanted a thing, the other simplones.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a $100 ticket for like at all.</seg>
<seg id="56">We must now think about who you like.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now, every hero worship has its 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - and to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - Van to see the abandoned, there is the field sex-social.</seg>
<seg id="60">And a cultural event van 300 people, 10 thousand never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is fading.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have to my fans, the most important thing is not deceive them, not spoil what you have achieved.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young made such tables a collector the had hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with paintings, with which usually people ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often confuse the concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I am in favour of this culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, what is missing in St Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - Buenos experts in culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is a concept: The official culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all of them can engage in culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">When the kings were the correct all was another way, the kings may not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the experts correct.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, there are now very good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have people in St. Petersburg that may well be experts, but are closed, because experts are needed to a higher level that properly assessed to them and to open road.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now is thriving on personal taste subjective.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to find other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - What is for you St Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there are ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">But on our stones that art is difficult to grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need cultural fields and we now have more writers readers, this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity that is going to exhibitions and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In our case, this class is tiny.</seg>
<seg id="84">We must make the art is fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project will be implemented with a grant of St. Petersburg.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The Earth is in danger.</seg>
<seg id="3">Global warming or an asteroid murderer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Caravans of spacecraft with humans on leave in search of a planet parts.</seg>
<seg id="5">To preserve humankind becomes the main question: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet parts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I believe that there is little to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="7">Indeed, only two are true planets that may be colonized, at least potentially.</seg>
<seg id="8">"These are Venus and Mars," said the chief investigator of the Astronomical Institute State, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It started to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Half a century ago that experiments were conducted with plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 were sent into space quail eggs to check how the embryo in conditions of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">As a result we get a chick normal.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is that this chick has to find support, should stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">By not find support, the chicks were volteretas at random.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 hours in newborns atrophy was given a total of instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Chicks did not react to the light and sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And the misfortune was that after four days simply died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And two times we were born chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them,", says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last time a "biological" miniarca flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 will continue experiments.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, in the "only" biosatellite Bion will travel species of the same sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space with fetuses.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there was nothing supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This was precisely the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing, the rats had space offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, has not yet managed to address the problem of reproduction directly into space.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is a difficult challenge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals, without their usual habitat, simply cannot make their sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an emotional fund.</seg>
<seg id="36">Similar experiments have been carried out for ethical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women travel into space from 50 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The greatest risk is spent Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the most valuable asset of humanity is the female body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our flying gull, and no one in the Earth could say: If it is after a flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">May or may not have a baby after this flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, no one has responded to this question," says veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only after a year of the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a child.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights all have found well, and a healthy generation is growing.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if you can say more, is dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The Centre hidrolaboratorio preparation of cosmonauts is a must, in preparation for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">In conditions of buoyancy null, cosmonauts practising their skills to work in space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water simulates weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If an adult water is a comfortable environment, while still hostile, for a newborn child is their home element.</seg>
<seg id="54">The small men-Anfibio seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from birth until the moment the first swim spend only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is very little to forget something," she says Marina Aksenova swimming newborns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women is necessary gravitation, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In weightlessness and abdominal muscles of the pelvis is decrepitan very fast, the ability of expulsion of the foetus is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we omit that, trusting in the action of stimulants for childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it pulls.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov makes this original question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without the sense of gravity, the agency does not create the skeleton or the muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn child in orbit is impossible to wear it with a special costume for training, as adults.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Simply be deprived of what is vital for him.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment that we are going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange, will lead to back to Earth to a disabled, totally unsuited to a person," the head of the bioethics committee biomedical problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, over time, this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Head of the inspection system: The NKÚ "švarc" has not given with the politician guilty</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the area of public procurements, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although their application limp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Says so Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect", but its implementation must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack" and described the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also reached similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of a bad practice, mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc system."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Prime Minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would not harass entrepreneurs with inspectors. Then, is prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be regulated in some way and if prohibits something, in that case, nor the chairman of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to perform such controls or require obligations," notes Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the committee of control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which compared the legislation concerning public awards in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">This is a parallel control that we are beginning to make some two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a simplified manner: European legislation regulates how it should organize public awards, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and, later, the practice itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have united all and, although the control has not yet finished, we have been very interesting differences. Generally, the laws of our country is tighter and more "complete", however, the practice in some specific parameters is better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This therefore confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly stringent rules, but it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What can bring in fact this project? What do you think are the conclusions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Precisely common control of this kind could contribute to that we invest efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improving the limits, although this does not have a very positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy of savings mean getting a proper thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not by the fact of reducing the limit of awards mean that we will achieve this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps because the system is saturated with both "red tape", that those who want to find flaws in the system may do so more readily than if the limits were as high as now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You spoke of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing the awards prácticaa public.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of controls in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or organizes otherwise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Regarding the offices, as the NKÚ, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school also, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also powers are to some extent analógas, however, while Germany is a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this aspect differs slightly from our system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the local legislation, is simpler than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally, I would like to make a comparison with no specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but you cannot specify exactly what is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That certainly, but not, I repeat, I do not like to make such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to say that even those countries as a model that we must deal with a large number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not benefit collaborate with our office, do you not believe?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With regard to the laws of our country, what meant for his Office Amendment Bill public awards? Is it is somehow its impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Considering that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet expressed in the proceedings of control.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we ex post controls, there is a need for a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For now, is in the process of preparing the future controls: We have initiated a new tool for detecting risks "economic" by which we did spend nearly 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as amended the limits, rectifying the situation of certain types of selection and similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess to the bureaucratic system?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem is that the rules can emerge "harden" and that it is impossible to do so.</seg>
<seg id="40">As with previous legislation, persons controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law does not respected award in the field of public meant the violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Does it make sense then tighten up the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I believe that in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of him and not to punish those who commit a formal decision, which has no impact on the taking of decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And what comes out of this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We will see where we take this path started.</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister has recently declared that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with švarc system called controls, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">The system "švarc is prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be regulated in any way and, if prohibits something, then even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office has the obligation to perform those checks and require obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Can say: "We changed the law and we allow", but could not say that we will do as usual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the law on public awards in the regulation is the manner in which should be done formally. And that is how it should be to protect public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the exclusion of the candidate with the best offer for failing to comply with the formal requirements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we need.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is only one among so many other news alarmist to which we like maintaining.</seg>
<seg id="4">The group of music The tap tap we like rather make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that wins enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In addition, in December organizáis a project really original: Three concerts at the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you explain it to our readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a charity event state that we have been planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to exploit the potential of marketing with the end of the Mayan calendar phrasing to 21 December at 11: 10 a.m..</seg>
<seg id="9">The previous day, on 20 December, at 9 p.m., we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will end at approximately the same time in which the Mayan calendar ends in Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially it was my idea, then we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to collect enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in the world that we will leave to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">To mark the end of the Mayan calendar have also created a unique collection of articles: Boots, shirts, bags and original sticks against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another form of support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The tap tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the hymn called against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="16">It is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course we do, and will be just the latest, well, always good and not the world...</seg>
<seg id="18">The sung all the interpreters at the same time in the three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hymns will be linked to each other at the same time thanks to the special broadcast live at Czech Television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Tomáš Hanák wrote the lyrics of the song and interprets the leading role of Jesus in the clip, which also sings Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did this collaboration?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organize many charitable and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We put all our effort to participate in this project.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in working with amused them and us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the money raised in concerts at the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To equipment for the educational institution without barriers Studeo, we have undertaken in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association tap in Jedličkův ústav.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pupils of the school of Jedličkův ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with the active fun and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pupils do not have adequate means of paying teachers and do a efuerzo to make this possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In each concert act several groups and interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="31">What are the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We try to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support, Lesbiens Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchy.</seg>
<seg id="34">For more detailed information, please consult www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Do you have planned any other action "spectacular" similar in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we will act in the festival for the first time Pražské bird, so here you prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and to me personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, until now ye have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The tap tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How is the logistics and the organization of these trips?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not so difficult how may seem at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">There are five members in electric wheelchair, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and moreover we carry much weight, the boxes with the instruments...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, until now we managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently went very smoothly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have found so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here in Russia; we have seen that, in the east, there is a long way to go.</seg>
<seg id="48">Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not often that a person moves single through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.</seg>
<seg id="49">So commonplace as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair in elevator, there is not.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, it has created a civil association that strives to focus attention problems of persons with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In what areas we must follow the lead of more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many areas in which we go behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the development and improvement of the situation also depend on those that are directly affected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is very normal for people with severe disabilities travels through your account in public and can go at the service, the museum, wherever...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not very common for a large number of persons with disabilities to participate in social life actively in this aspect, with The Tap Tap just go a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes in the emerging eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything really.</seg>
<seg id="57">Until now, are isolated cases of people who have a large force of will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The tap tap is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what I took to be the group in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I like educator in Jedličkův ústav, where he had a lot of young people around me who wanted to engage in something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am musician, playing, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a business partner.</seg>
<seg id="61">And over time, as our CM Láďa Angelovič, we were a little hands (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us very connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work that cannot be seen, is as if it did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the support of the European Union, we have also quality teachers, equipment, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Do you had to go so far with The tap tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I saw the potential that had, that something can be done differently.</seg>
<seg id="68">The entertainment world is full of things that resemble each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical, in their own way, all new is cautiously and takes a long time to be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The tap tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The impression of someone who see us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...</seg>
<seg id="72">But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not neglected ones experiencing and of those who should have compassion.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that provides the necessary means.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if something goes well them to persons with disabilities, then, is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Do Ayudó the fact that you are a demanding boss, as she describes many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do an excellent job, we must be rigorous in many respects and that some discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think it is quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with his head in the clouds and when they hear that they must come two days to test, go to the preparatory test and spend much time travelling and concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">But this is how it works everywhere, in each group who want to work and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently the group The tap tap has twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are a group open, people move in and out, cannot be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who will always friendly and open doors</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno and Fléda Plynojem in Ostrava and participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">The three cities will be connected to the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the group The tap tap "End of the world, cancelled"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The objective of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance equipment of multifunctional school without barriers STUDEO Jedličkův ústav in Prague, costing 25 million Czech crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry to the option of advance sales in Bohemiaticket</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week accepted Poland as the twelfth member of ESA. Is the second country ESA member Bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland launched an intense cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the commission of projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the path of Poland to the cosmos started much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Polish enthusiasts are already engaged in flights into space before the Second World War, though not always understood their work.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld astronomical observatory in the Warsaw where, on 6 December 1933, presented their ideas about the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics."</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (born the 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 Šternfeld scored in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for its "Introduction to cosmonautics."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), above, was later established in a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hundreds of published articles in journals Polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became an advocate of cosmonautics, was known around the world and its contribution to the science was rewarded when he started his name to one of the craters of the dark side of the moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was going to be fitted with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, it was not known who was the author of the proposal and not know details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear if the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresina or braking.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Starting in 1933 Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the material preserved, it is evident that the investigation led to the stadium of the tests in practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, with the arrival of German troops, was halted the investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 appeared in the press the prototype of a hunting missile photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study "- Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza," the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were intended for military use of motors for missiles.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, the Advisory Committee (provisional scientific Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of techniques of missiles for military use and coordinated all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other studies dealing with cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy reference is made for the first time to society with four articles very extensive engaged in astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society devoted to cosmonautics.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time had already been implemented projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the investigation was a cosmic discipline with future prospects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">He served in this position until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket which was conducted scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket had a height of 1.8 meters, about 80 cm in length and there were no more than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, he completed the version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 began testing of aerial rockets RM-2 of two stages in the desert of Błędów.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket measured 1.4 metres and weighed about 11.5 kg</seg>
<seg id="36">Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of scientific study right. The rocket RM-34 would have a height of 14.5 km and his mission would control the wind in height.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962, suspended the work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor rocket-1, which was built for the 1962 and 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was designed as a rocket of two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial 32.5 kg weight</seg>
<seg id="40">Developed three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed among themselves for the space available to scientists.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the rocket Meteor-1A space available for the volume was 0.4 litres in the Meteor-1B of 34 litres and the Meteor-Fengyun 1C of 0.62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The peak maximum in the three types was 37 km</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Air Institute the Meteor rocket-2, whose first tests air began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km in height.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then built the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">There is also the entry of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation of cosmic space on Artificial Soviets and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the constitutional court suspended the law traabajos social.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision sparked a heated discussion in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course it will be interesting to examine the current problem from a wider point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, this means that the various forms of economic and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">The case is in the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital and unlimited private, along with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The effect of the major differences in the cost of labour (wages) produces economic stress.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this heading is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this cause "bajadda" in the price of competitor with the aim of taking the bulk of the market and thus increase their profit margin.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a large scale means, for the majority of employers, shifting production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared with other economies, is higher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the private capital has no social responsibility and, with it, nor is it responsible for this phenomenon, generates unemployment grows necessarily social spending of the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">This whole situation conducive to the total lack of employers to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social harm that have brought in their pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to submit specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the objective to artificially reduce the social status of the population and, thus, attract foreign capital to the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Put another way, governments are private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is especially evident in the changes of existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to force the population to accept the making of private capital, particularly with regard to wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This takes place, on the one hand, by the system of financial liability in the event of unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty coupled with the rise of the differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">For a number of years, exist in Germany points of delivery of food to poor people who cannot keep up with his own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people receiving such aid is already the million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, a case not uncommon: Employed persons with a salary so low that the state should pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was a scandal of this type related to the situation of the employees of the German federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">Saving measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU lead, no doubt, to the same situation. People, under pressure from a huge decline of their social status, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to eke out a living with a dismal wage on the edge of society, in the hope that one day the country capital private investor.</seg>
<seg id="25">Is it necessary to preguntrarse where does it come from?</seg>
<seg id="26">In the case in question of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptian or African continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also affects the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and the media say ad nauseam that the state should not provide capital to the economy, to lead the economy leads to its failure.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control.</seg>
<seg id="30">Below, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence with his selfishness in the political march and thus throughout the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this case, the answer is clearly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and pervasive in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a hopeless situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is the following: Government ministries, lack of financial resources, commissioned drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked with industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">This type of bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that democracies with a liberal approach are quickly in a situation that describes how the Appiános in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in times of César and Pompeii: "The state took time disintegrating and administrations were in force."</seg>
<seg id="38">In exchange for bribes, favours obtained unlawfully and aid to finance stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption continued unimpeded and the people went to the polls to vote in advance apalabrado "..." had not people with nature that wanted to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls "..." Esprit to speak seriously that the only remedy for a situation as serious was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man strong "... Although Appiános thought in Pompeii, César came to power and transformed democracy forever in autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion, in the same way that in ancient times, is that the current society is based on preferences, careless of the individual benefits without taking into account the common interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is not capable, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole of society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is the same as that of then, a decline of the elite without precedent, without a effort to reform it in depth.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should be sought, therefore, in unbridled liberalisation of the economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a kind of liberal democracy, as a pause defined, awaiting the next hit.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact is that the elite really devastating current completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient history and the most recent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The suspension of the law on public procurements is not the solution; at least not in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social status of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is, therefore, systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is to concrete, political reforms that strengthen the participation of both the state capital as the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the 1990s the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to cease associating his name with criminal acts of great seriousness. The power and wealth, or both, they covered the shoulders, which always meant a strengthening.</seg>
<seg id="17">Have a major share in almost all the world ’ s central banks and in those countries that are not represented, has been declared or is preparing a war: Before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack in Iraq were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime, Russia has made the central bank to the Russian government.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Civil War to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (EDF) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF to have triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Its quest for global power took over the years 1859 - 1871 to develop a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, awarded the degree 33.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war aimed to remove the large states monarchists throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is intended to reduce the population of the land between half a million and one billion people (similar amount of slaves to their welfare and luxury and would not be sufficient resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which operates the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, follows the dynamic of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order ab Dai - order out of chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are, however, wrong, and have always a worsening situation. If not, it suffices to recall that the EDF was created to avoid a crisis such as the 1907.</seg>
<seg id="25">So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the throne austro-Hungarian, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, the First World War, vandalized tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended so sudden and unjustified militarily and economically, the capitulation of Germany (wars to finish with Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.</seg>
<seg id="27">To prepare the ground of the Second World War, allowed bankers and political development, covertly, a conflict situation following the enormous repairs of war imposed on Germany, thus setting the optimum conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, were not satisfied with the Germans for the solution of the Führer, which was strong enough and simple and drew guilty, and build after a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities with a strong German minority who should represent and represented as well as the fifth column, that lit the flame and led to the outbreak of war.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild fostered the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The Balfour Declaration above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflict with the Arab population of the place.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The outbreak of the Second World War: It is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope to which they were bound international bankers in a principle or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jewry in the concentration camps created optimum conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the global society.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the State of Israel was created the focus for a third war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers were initiated, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, become victim in the front line of combat, now with the population generally Arab or Muslim Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is a laboratory immense, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of his country, but also internationally. Take, for example, how are divided so sharp supporters and opponents of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their quest for global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only present candidates in the election.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, which makes every effort to wage war on Iran, and considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where the 20 per cent of the entire global oil (the corridor navigation has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>

<seg id="38">Under what light were now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All I need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the affluent financial aristocracy.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world in which each new individual he implements a chip birth controls all his being.</seg>

<seg id="1">Film: If Argo is raw, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a group of the manifestation of Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">His release was going to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution, he fled to the US, which had sponsored his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: Throw the Shah overboard he could not be allowed, since, if he did, jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the formation of the theocratic regime, was not available to them.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which has since been further intensified with the failed attempt to liberate the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention of the Algerian government negotiator.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="9">Failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter faced Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film "Argo" director and actor Ben Affleck addresses an episode of this story, which had had a small success for America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a difficult journey, ended in the residence of the Canadian embassy.</seg>
<seg id="13">CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for that helped a story disguised a bizarre: Came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film that examines the location in the country for the filming of an overproduction of science fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan that charted the ex-filtration "expert" Toni Mendez involved the collaboration of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">For that lies seem truthful, wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, society of farming had even a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation was kept secret for a long time, the film has been done from the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film Affleck is a unique combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, a political thriller realistic; on the other, called "caper movie," the story of an episode that went well, deceitful (an example may be the series Ocean 's Eleven).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film combine moods. We find on the one hand sequences well documented in Tehran. In the sequence of receivables are photographs emblematic of the time of the events, which were enshrined in the same way in the film; there are many differences in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other, a typical scenes Hollywood both leaner, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And furthermore, scenes of the CIA and other institutions: Men elections that analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career as an excellent way.</seg>
<seg id="24">The actor, who had been the subject of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of act has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film after "Adiós small, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, is the first film of Affleck in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placing the directors of old films above standards of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck evidenced in Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the movie takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of events true. The opening sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive for its capacity synoptic that, at the same time, conveys the thrill of confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history is a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and its partners get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the team impostor in the bazaar in Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the way of cinematic scenes more intriguing.</seg>
<seg id="33">And manages quite well. Sometimes adds something to the reality: Here is not all so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit following his track become crazy).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that emerges from the need to show too much action in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman has a role very funny as partners of Hollywood, while its characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For these reasons, the film Affleck loses a bit of stroke dramatic, but it is a film that they can continue with moderately interested, evaluate its implementation and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that collapse, that will be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">As evocation of a true story and as proof of that can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules for the inflated balloon, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, that every year presented a survey on the bank charges more absurd, has now decided to announce the competition on "the regulation or ideas more absurd of the workshop of the EU."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"We came up after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women in leadership positions in the big European companies," explained sure, "said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Between absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court of consolidating the insurance policies between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, women were once had a huge head start over better prices in the life insurance because they represent objectively a lower risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Incredible other ideas "workshop of the EU may be proposed by the people by the end of this year."</seg>
<seg id="7">The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013 "Nacher, reported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or guideline shadow the size of cages for laying hens, which has contributed to the substantial increase in the price of eggs this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The factual ban has been criticized for using the phrase "spread butter" or the withdrawal of the classic bulb shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A banana quality must have a length of 14 centimetres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The apparatus of the Union takes such decisions often under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are defended by any State or group of States (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of the veto, claims the demands of their banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 centimetres and could not submit "abnormal bends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission is defended by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national standards not homogenized to date, that only complicate their marketing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rules that make reference to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive carries a waste of groceries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the US last year that in inflatable balloons marketed is obligatory warn that children under 8 years are not allowed to puffing them up without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The US referred here to an American study whereby, when there is talk of toys, the balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Strange occurrences are born even in our country</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: Anyone who has any formal role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. Not to injure the sensitivity of Greece, it must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists: Let, nominated in the survey, between some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU identified the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">Later, the Czech Republic, for example, surpassed the established for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of fine substantial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey also were interested to the occurrence of pay for those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to the application of subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">This kind of ideas not emerged in Brussels but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are disadvantaged by the fact of not having sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We call on the European Union compensation, "stated in the autumn of 2004 the then minister of agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">He argued with the fact that in our country occurred much grain and, as a result of the shop calls for intervention, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission had been prepared to help the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of the grain of countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">The subsidy to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities for the ministry for local development led by the Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, is aimed at the drafting of applications for grants of Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: Prescriptions are a rare exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more, according to some experts, our recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to experts, the most serious problem is, for instance, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the Member States have achieved in negotiations on budgets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The Czechs also have a chord, in the same way as other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czechs, after six years of disputes with German and Austrian successfully defended the designation of origin of Ricotta of Olomouc, but had to change the name to the rum, whose national tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed "tuzemák."</seg>
<seg id="36">Only products produced from sugar cane distillate can be denominated rum, but not those made from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official listing of protected designations of origin of the EU, along with the feta cheese and Gorgonzola known throughout the world, the German city of Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, are already e.g. cookies of Karlovy Vary, carp and Pohořelice Třeboň entitled ‘ and even the variety of hops in Teplice.</seg>
<seg id="38">As maras protected from the EU, can be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and Karlsbad forest near v Podkrkonoší.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">This is not to be a senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If our country was so good, then do not submit my candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since I cannot bear to see how it steals in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, increased taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">He had no ambitions to be political.</seg>
<seg id="7">When I see something that I do not like, attempt to come up with a solution to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And as I already have forty years and my candidacy is independent, the only way to change things is to stand as a senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter has been path to the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="10">Is it not turning our backs on those who have voted?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later stated that if elected senator, submit my candidacy for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">But my goal is not the role; the role is the tool that I can make my own ideas.</seg>
<seg id="14">Why do I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not just that we are a nation that we in the bar or in front of the television, but we drive down to anyone who wants to start a change.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is compounded by the media, which will discredit and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom of lying.</seg>
<seg id="17">For me it is said to have bribed to journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We are going to talk about their ideas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial and thesis criminal accountability of politicians and the declaration of ownership over 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">This should change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How to resolve it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure for the office of Guide recognized as independent work, and we succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is in politics: If someone comes with a good proposal, either from the right or left, refused to purpose and this affects the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent candidate, I have the greatest potential to obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups.</seg>
<seg id="26">Without encasillamientos or dogmas of party, I have the ability to choose something of each party that is best for our country and its implementation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Is rather a man from the right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech standpoint, I have the impression that the people I considered more leftist.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it is not important, whether it is a bit of a little left or right.</seg>
<seg id="30">What matters to me is that we are successful.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not care if someone is on the right or the left, I would like to add to the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or DOS and, in the same way, I am against the bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A joke when it says that it is capable of populist.</seg>

<seg id="37">There will be those who call populism, but all the proposals that I speak are already operating in the world or known experts talk about them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of parliament only remain slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And thus cannot survive in the long term policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you believe that if he is going to people and talk to them, will succeed, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">Persuading politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my part to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="43">If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live webcast on television in which would appeal to the leaders of the parliamentary parties that give the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.</seg>
<seg id="44">And, eventually, they would have to communicate why do not want them.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong character that notes the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Consider the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time I say that I am just a fan, I am neither a genius or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For my views and ideals attempt seek allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">I start in politics and attempt to secure the broadest possible support for my programme.</seg>
<seg id="50">Attempt to take things forward myself, but in the event that it goes well within six years I will leave and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sounds a bit as if Okamura out to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am no savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that a person does not do anything, that is why I visited a number of known personalities, for if you encouraging present his candidacy for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because I had a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed frauds with light oils heating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I tabled on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, I am now in the balance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted to representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate are two of the independent sector.</seg>
<seg id="59">People chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to bring about change.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Looking to form his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not yet considered because I do not have time to do so, to check the unblemished past of each of the potential members of the party, nor have money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency, in my account transparent only CZK 20,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Would it not have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">Talk of statements of the property, how is it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I think my private property in some 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a ground worth 25 million, a flat valued ten million, another floor appraised in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, he was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against the wickedness and injustices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do Conduce an Aston Martin, their property is worth 60 million and has no money to the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You said that you want to change the republic but is not to put too much money on their side.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Do I have to endeudarme?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign have already put 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that has no sponsor demonstrates that there is not much interest in my program.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money in my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign covered in essence what will I receive salary of senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But could not live. For example, could not pay my son English school, which costs 30,000 kroons a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just want to make money, then I would.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So that will continue with its business in order to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Surely has said before that was going to leave this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This has nothing to do with higher pay.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, in part I left my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">People want to be the Samaritan that saving the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to live of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much usually win monthly as entrepreneur?</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architectural firm MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only on the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I think that the building is fun, futuristic looks, and finally there is something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a bystander that passes through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, said: "In addition, the building is beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why we need a library today.</seg>
<seg id="5">We all have the Internet, tablets and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one comes to taste these libraries outmoded, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a city bedroom located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honour of having risen to a record to forget.</seg>
<seg id="8">The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the lowest literacy rate of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To counter this situation so shameful, some years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general culture and copy the seven bridges that are represented in the fictitious euro notes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete decorated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the offensive education was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so it was as political leaders decided that there was only a chance to improve statistics: Had to build a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, the Dutch architecture firm MVRDV, a teacher in the art of the bar diagrams and responsible for buildings funny as well as cynical, took the issue with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury looked perplexed around it and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the words: "My dear fellow citizens!</seg>
<seg id="14">Here you have, my proposal to the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million stands on the runway.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of the project of revitalization, complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and attached.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, the mountain of books second prize was awarded the "Best Library of NL 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project is also nominated to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In this way, the small town without history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian zone postmodern and a council unbelievably ugly after whose white facade one intuiría rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first cultural public building in its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road until the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression is that this is a paradise of books under a cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is true that there is a lift that transports us right at the centre of the massif, but the true lovers of space and reading does not use it, preferring merged with topography at every step of their climb to the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">The interior completely glazed is bright and easy to appreciate at a glance, the brick floor annealing and the elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public library.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">To raise the view you can get to visualize the banks of the park, dogs and children playing football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books and more books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and the centre opens an enormous dark room that generally tends to be something uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">What we have done is upside down the classic spatial configuration and draw the reading of the interior abroad.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain is very well used: In the middle are the offices, the library of the Internet, the chess club, the centre of environmental education and the maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special mention should be made of the black shelves lining the duties and balustrade parapet wall, at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="32">The look, the feel and smell are strangers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and engineers more civilians a day shake their heads when they hear about this material unknown.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="35">And that is how one day, on a farm Friesland, we come up against the byproduct suitable from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands plastic fabric used a few millimetres thick as a basis to hold the roots of crops.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a cheap and efficient material.</seg>
<seg id="38">This tissue lasts two seasons and then discarded.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library that fabric prensó, for the first time in such numbers, to get plates of four centimetres thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the heat and pressure, the agricultural (plastic chair) changes colour and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and collectible sport.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps you get to the top of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 metres around the mountain awaits us the reward: From the cafeteria is not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy tasty croquettes and their Dutch ficus planted in enormous pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">These create a pleasant atmosphere to the couple who have the atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations to a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Believe it or not given their large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Despite the mountain of books is situated under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines only for a few hours inside.</seg>
<seg id="48">The huge wooden cerchas located in respect across the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorbed most of the rays of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="49">This creates a comfortable indoor climate.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest is a thing of electric blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker of IT, already has dared to set foot in the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Similarly, Professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library, she describes the "Boekenberg" soul "as the late" of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration held a couple of weeks ago, he invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of his private collection.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this way is to fill the gaps, for the moment, optical a library that still does not have its complete archive; currently has 70,000 copies.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has a meaning.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are full.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than a half empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have some link to this building.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although only there to decorate.</seg>
<seg id="62">In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a success in this discipline that reigns in the specialized jargon is known as "creation of an identity."</seg>
<seg id="63">The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">Regardless of the young and uneducated that can be.</seg>
<seg id="65">Finally a starting point for shaping their identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The Germans must play a leading role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, US relations expert UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a diplomatic position quite tricky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany intimated that he would vote against the proposal to give the Palestinian territories the status of observer State of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, finally Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why is that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I believe that it supports the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when the question was to establish a zone of prohibition of flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has been declared finally by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do you find it difficult to Germany take a clear stand when major international issues are at stake?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is because at the moment is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">And making it even more difficult things is that Europeans do not have a coherent policy and uniform.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="18">They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think we are still feeling what its role, but have already on the road to a foreign policy "normal".</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy similar to the countries like France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What does specifically a foreign policy "normal" from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is ready to defend different positions in the United States or its European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and that is why Germany should protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Are these economic interests have influenced the position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">For this reason has to be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor Arab elites.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is important, of course.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not lead to any such importance because it is not a wholly unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it played a key role in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany has undermined its relationship with the US to abstain from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a large degree of understanding.</seg>
<seg id="33">For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a break as drastic as in the case of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps this Germany managed to win a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all, this has only show that is a country that taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different views about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, the US has shown clearly in favour of a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is there disparity of views between the US and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">There have always been these disparities owing to US domestic politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But, because of the political situation that live here, it is clear that the government cannot defend in public that position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real divergence of views is not actually the scale attached to it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we look at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all happy with the policy that develops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Do you find it difficult to Germany to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its major partners in the EU, on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a consistent and coherent European policy, but that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, do not have the possibility of being part of an upper body, but should also promote things from its own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course, this is not easy for Germany, whether simply for the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a thorny issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that the Germans have clear that should play the role of independent figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Could we cite Germany itself in the role of important international player? Does in fact Germany assume a leading role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or perhaps still finds it difficult to accept that leadership?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not yet accustomed, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as a key player, occur certain feelings flat hierarchies.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is not easy for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is an old problem and is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the countries enemies.</seg>
<seg id="59">Seen this way, Germany is in a much more difficult for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must show a receptive to the different neighbours and opinions and that it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of the US in European politics ever dwindling, but the EU does not cover of time that gap, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will have no choice but to assume a leading role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they do not like, if it is unpleasant or if you become a people even more unpopular, c 'est la vie!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stephen Szabo is Executive Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and experts in politics from Europe and North America analysed jointly the challenges facing the transatlantic community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection" brand in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a brand known globally and Polo Ralph Lauren, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">After this name is a designation officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, it enjoys protection while the real epónimos fail to file a lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear that they will give the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"To foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of rights of protection in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week comes to my table a new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-instead of Gucci and Prada is Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies also copied legally in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens an archive in which keeps seats of the office of brands of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company requested register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that artificial also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That the Chinese are world champions in that copying and violating the rights of intellectual property is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities there are department stores of several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, cases of Pattloch are other. On behalf of his clients, he fight against the fact that the office of brands officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered in another place.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word originates in the Chinese term "Bang," Dakuan</seg>
<seg id="19">That refers to women who have "fish" to a rich man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is bad for business, we must combat it," requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand makes waters, the monopoly position disappears and the harm suffered by the image is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the costs of the sectors affected millionaires, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data of the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is in size, the third market for luxury items and the growing faster.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, to achieve the cancellation of registration of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and there is a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="26">The processes can extend up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because he had spent so much time that the name of the demand had already become a reality "market".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"If the claimant is bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to plagiador because the process has harmed the brand in China," says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery maker SANY, the company that has been taken over recently by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is why today the Chinese may continue to use an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The buyer for Volvo, Geely, used initially a blue and white logo that he remembered largely to BMW; the matter was litigated in the courts and Geely had to modify it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The lost Lacoste clothing manufacturer in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The office of brands CTMO in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.</seg>
<seg id="37">Last year, however, "the emergency work reverted to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">In this way, the number of processes of claim without process has been reduced by 22 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, 81,500 claims remain pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Fight it costs a lot of money</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is usual in China, the figures are surprising.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trademarks, almost a third higher than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This would be a new record and means that China leads for the tenth consecutive year, the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the office of brands.</seg>
<seg id="45">It seems that this also applies to the number of logos valid, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 were bagging 1.8 billion yuan in fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Fight it costs a lot of money, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the group fighting in court against a copier Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="50">While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of car parts of imitation,</seg>
<seg id="51">The copier has succeeded in securing rights on the Chinese brand Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The office of brands CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the Münchners.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the following two bodies have given the right to Freudenberg, but the opposing party is fighting today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We must be extremely cautious</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where he is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler hoped to resolved the issue and commends the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, also claims that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."</seg>
<seg id="59">It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the file business has had to revise files up to 100 years old to give evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a six figure sum "euro" with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but was unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This shows how much to us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers that lurk in the Far East threatens to affect Europe,</seg>
<seg id="63">Specifically whether the imitators ensured there unprotected trademark rights.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some time ago that the group left the commercial sphere, but managed to prevent the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"We have to be very careful," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and the lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies to be extremely careful when doing business with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international human rights law brand, but what we have to do is register "also in China anything that might be capable of protection", as Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the topic may be much more expensive than a simple registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay the other party licence fees for its own name, as explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">That or in the segment in question we would be removed from the market.</seg>

<seg id="1">World day for the fight against AIDS: Dance, sing, help</seg>

<seg id="2">In Heidelberg tested the choir Imbongi and in Swaziland rejoice AIDS orphans</seg>
<seg id="3">The story of a link capable of overcoming a lot more than 8.733 kilometres away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First starts for the dance: Cowboy boots, shoes, basketball shoes had heels and seek the compass on the parquet floors, and find them quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">One, two, three, four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (bass, tenor, alto and soprano), arremolinándose, entorpeciéndose and following each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, almost threatening to pull out of their cells in trying to bring order with his energetic and gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi tested a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">They have also reached the 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until the master of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om 'Obani" is not an easy piece, every voice choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: The Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Aid for</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to an estimate of UNAIDS, the United Nations programme for combating AIDS, worldwide, approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland there are 245.000 AIDS orphans.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than 40% of the population is HIV positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents to 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.</seg>
<seg id="17">Seventy of them attend secondary school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">By 15 or 20 euros a month can sponsor a child.</seg>
<seg id="19">This provision will cover the enrolment of school, the uniform and guarantees one hot meal per day in the Gogo Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in Zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirista."</seg>
<seg id="21">In this room nobody knows speak fluently this Bantu language, but sing do.</seg>
<seg id="22">For ten years, this chorus tested songs in this smooth foreign language sometimes achieves jumping to their place of origin: Southern Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">To 8.733 miles away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty per cent is infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 already have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="27">Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: The infection rate of AIDS higher and the hopes of living lowest worldwide, according to Unicef.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population struggled with circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40 per cent of the inhabitants of Swaziland are bearers of human immunodeficiency virus, and die with something more than thirty years has become commonplace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered this hidden population, but what they saw especially were many children in the streets that were not only of the protection of their parents, but the main thing: Food, clothes and training.</seg>
<seg id="31">School without title, the possibilities in a poor country are slim.</seg>
<seg id="32">Initially was only the particular commitment of a few which made it possible for a child to school and to enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, a year after the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" that has since worked professionally of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">Facts on sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">Between STDs are bacterial origin of syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="37">The most common STDs of origin are the AIDS virus, the human papilloma virus, herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The lice infestation and scabies are among STD transmitted by parasites.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups of affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the case of adults heterosexual sexually transmitted diseases are commonly used chlamydia infections, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, thrush (mushroom) and gonorrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively limited; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to surveys in Europe, three quarters of all infections occur in young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In our country, the human papilloma virus also adds to the most common diseases among youth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has evolved the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of infections by syphilis doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001 for 3,698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections has a downward trend since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is a tenth less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often do not cause cause pain and other symptoms, and therefore was not detected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases also can be transmitted through infected with dirt and by physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">For this reason, the experts recommend regularly medical examinations, especially if it changes with frequency of sexual partner.</seg>
<seg id="60">If they are diagnosed early, the majority of STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any consequence late.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through partnerships, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the chorus for his performances throughout Germany, come to raise enough money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Overall we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni proud," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the own people Zodwa Dlamini a woman confident and with leadership manages money sent from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">Deals with that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The "gogos", as it is called to older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof live and ensure that children go to school every day on time and in uniform.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who do not have anyone are under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, earning a wage of the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a school of sewing, has built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American ISP health organization, has had many of the inhabitants of the people undergo an HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not something obvious, since, despite the apparent that is this disease throughout the country, usually do not speak openly about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is absolute taboo," said Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Something strange in a country in which the king has officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of the Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This way of life not formally accepted is largely responsible for the spread so rapid that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it is also due to the countless individuals who travel the country from one side to the other and carried wherever they go.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner free condoms can be achieved, but these are hardly used.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is another culture, here only accept the skin against skin contact. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To promote cultural exchange, the choir Imbongi travels every two or three years for southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember of the apartheid era.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white sing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and much joy, but has also succeeded in extracting a couple of tears to some rabid border.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey leads them to always Esitjeni, where the singers visit children sponsored.</seg>
<seg id="82">Despite this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Come to Esitjeni, there shines the light", says the people of the place.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after touring the 8.733 km as the crow flies back to Heidelberg until the rehearsal of the street Bergheimer full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see shine the light from there.</seg>

<seg id="7">It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water is presumably of comets or, most likely, of asteroids that in its day clashed against Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nobody relates the finding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our window to the universe: The most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei use it a year later to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we offer are increasingly depth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">This reveals the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The interior of the Great Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Despite this, reaches a diameter of approximately 11 metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of this construction is more economical than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas also has an elevation angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite having a diameter of mirror comparatively smaller, such capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.</seg>
<seg id="66">"In the" Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that is worthy of its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">With a total of four mirrors, the telescope also can illuminate the infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The ESO will also host the E-ELT (European it Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).</seg>
<seg id="71">Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">Until 2018 is not expected to take pictures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">These include two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 metres.</seg>
<seg id="75">Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">On Mauna Kea is planning to build a new telescope with a daunting and diameter mirror of 30 metres.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is an image of how it would be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since the 24 April 1990 sends images of distant galaxies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On 2 February 2011 NASA announced that since the start of its mission had been located 1.235 candidate planets.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the picture are the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the functions of the telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Researchers suspect that in the south pole of Mercury also ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is no evidence, because the Messenger probe revolves around the globe in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">For decades radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that is the case.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The minibus moves loud noise through the winding road that goes by wooded hills, rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However, we are in the most southern point of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are the "talyshi", a town of which it is not that much, apart from the Persian and the Azeri and which are very durable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Our final destination is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">This small town boasts a solid perhaps too architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit entirely in a picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.</seg>
<seg id="16">For touring the 323 kilometres that separate the two urban centres, there is a need for eight hours because the road is a single direction.</seg>
<seg id="17">The staggering wealth enjoyed by the country through the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this hidden region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what we need to become a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we celebrate the Feast of older persons in the world," says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">This is the director of the Museum of the ILC, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here is documented life of eight dozen talyshis of place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva notes an image in black and white.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">A child died at the age of 136 years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, there is no birth certificate which certifies.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if we consider that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time to devise a daughter more at the age of 136 years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Is it wrong then Şirali Müslümov in their age in a couple of decades?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very elderly people," said Scholz, "even in Sardinia many older men."</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age; especially when there is no civil registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day glasses filled with melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is a fact that, in a surprisingly common, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why live here in the south, so many elderly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The tour guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the genes of the special talyshis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause resides in food.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not appear logical that a diet high in calories of the talyshi, who love the meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom, moreover, drink a glass of melted butter, so healthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or perhaps it is the form of natural life which keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">Their 97 years is relatively young to standards for these latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sitting on the floor, moved tirelessly a huge vat of butter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also brincan from one side to the other two children.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen preparing tea for the guests, a tea serving in a typical vessels with a curved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the headscarf hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son we discover proud.</seg>
<seg id="48">I have always wash hair with milk, which is why I never has fallen and has maintained its color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I never used a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The pension is enough to live</seg>

<seg id="52">In my life I have not gone ever to make the purchase in a supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then we spoke of her husband, who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">The worst was the period following the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, all returned to track when the "wanted" father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in Azerbaijan on religious affiliation to the figure of the nation, who heads his country as a dictator, knows no bounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">It remained in power until 2003, when he handed the baton to his son Ilham.</seg>
<seg id="59">At least older people of Azerbaijan does not know what is poverty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva charges 230 manats (roughly the same amount in euros) in concept of monthly pension, an amount that can live well, considering the situation here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And perhaps the son of graying Mirzayeva is right: "In our culture are the most highly respected."</seg>
<seg id="62">Living in a large family, are beloved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.</seg>

<seg id="12">However, neither Egyptians or the whole world know very well what this engineer of 61 years with a PhD from the University of Southern California really want to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Do you intend to deprived of its power to the judiciary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in a night at 15 hours, are truly worrying.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the draft also said that the jurisprudence "is based on the principles of Islamic law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, what does that mean of "principles"?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take this vague wording, as well as the margin for manoeuvre that legal, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is at least suggesting a new article added: In all matters relating to the sharia check with the University Al-Ashar Islamic institution, the most important of the country with a great power in all Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What is also problematic is that seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a harsh crackdown on the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.</seg>
<seg id="24">As set out in the draft, the State had to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote morals and values."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is a formulation so vague in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the content of film and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Let me make it clear it is not anything other than censure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">By the way that no article provides explicitly equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">However another prohibits offend or defaming the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, it is not clear what is an offence and how must be punished.</seg>
<seg id="30">Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits the "insult to the people"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Is it enough a caricature of the President or a joke about a lawyer?</seg>
<seg id="32">Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to beauty for signature and which, their words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution has become"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to defeat the Minutes before they can enter into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, the third in the lists to the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize and these of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history."</seg>
<seg id="38">Through Twitter followers accused the beauty of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."</seg>
<seg id="39">"When holding the referendum will go to his palace and derrocaremos", says the opposition Jasser Said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiada", was quoted in the media Egyptians to opposition politician Chaled Ali.</seg>
<seg id="41">And several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Quran is our constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For its part, the Muslim community well organised appealed to celebrate a counter-demonstration; for if not in Tahrir Square, but after a sentence at the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafis took part in the same to the cry of: "The people demand the implementation of the divine law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Required to clean up the country "beauty", at the same time that proclaimed: "The Quran is our constitution."</seg>
<seg id="46">A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have resulted in a situation similar to that of a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is clear that the supporters of beauty did not want to risk that something like this to happen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the draft constitution as supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now it is time to let the people decide in the polls what direction should follow the country.</seg>
<seg id="50">In this regard, it seems that the draft Islamists has guaranteed the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced which should actually have lasted until February and including all social forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">This lawyer for 48 years specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when being held in prison or had to face trial for the dictatorship of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="54">Not because share its ideology, but because for him the Human Rights are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">For this reason was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="56">"And now the expression 'Human Rights' even appears in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag."</seg>
<seg id="57">The expansion of the powers of beauty to the three branches of State made this lawyer resign itself.</seg>
<seg id="58">The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening civil society, which has made the president is abolishing it," laments Saeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda, also feel abandoned by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.</seg>
<seg id="62">This could turn against him.</seg>
<seg id="63">A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are crafting a monster that ye cannot control."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: More smelly fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is it possible that the success of the country has something to do with his appetite for a very smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a series of cheese excessively cured.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put in the midst of a mountain of soccer clothes wet and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave it there a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can then smell the aroma of crippling rakfisk, one of the specialties of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">Is snowed. The landscape is spectacular and the smell, always present, floats in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The trout in salty rakfisk is that allowed to ferment in water, depending on the smelly that you prefer, until a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As obscures and becoming more cold, Norwegians flocking to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to the delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Eats raw and then drink a glass of aquavit of a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the "General of Rakfisk", which is responsible for organizing the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Everywhere we see people eating this fish is stored in small cubes and sipping a drink large quantities of drink.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people like more than the aquavit rakfisk Havard," says.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink can kill the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pruebo some pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid pass near the nose, not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has come a few km by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty ravaged Norway and in which, before the cooling, fish are kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, removed and, obviously with the senses inactive because of the alcohol, eats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a comprehensive system of social services.</seg>
<seg id="22">A flow of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until a not too much richer than Norway, come to this country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is considered important, an essential part, although quite smelly, last of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dishes are among the most expensive that you can buy.</seg>
<seg id="25">But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer or a cane sandwich will cost a whopping 10 €($14) each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and most Norwegians like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here people is still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist extreme right that acribilló shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July."</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians have trouble very much believe that in its quiet country one of theirs was able to commit such cruelty and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After much of the wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 1970s, one of the oil and gas industries largest in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But the oil is not the only reason that we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, while moving trays of rakfisk and that, with his long hair blonde and its striking blue eyes, it depicts the welfare Norwegian.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We are as you people prudent."</seg>
<seg id="33">His English, as most people in this country, is impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We do not like to boast, we do not like the ostentation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except for a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">While everyone was dissipating money lacking during the years preceding the financial crisis across the world, Norway maintained the wallet well closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"While we can skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And eat rakfisk casual," she adds with a laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am in the snow queuing up to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now a moose burgers is certainly something quite different and succulent palate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But by night, this smelly fish.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel where I stay is one of the many restaurants that marks a dinner of rakfisk where diners voted the best fish, or perhaps the most tests the nostrils.</seg>
<seg id="43">A live has connected TV presenter who leads with a crane and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.</seg>
<seg id="44">It seems the Eurovision contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here is our score, Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There is laughter and applause.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls of the chair, perhaps defeated by aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or perhaps the vapors of all that fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, discusses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of its population.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad today.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already in itself has been installed, congested since Monday a siege of steel that cuts several of the main roads leading to the town and which is causing enormous chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The aim, however, was not prevent workers to arrive at their place of work, but avoid protesters may come to the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will take over the management of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He faces a difficult task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is in a war against the narcotráfco that has already killed some 60,000 lives in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama in the Oval Office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Prior to rub shoulders with the president of the USA, the prior political experience of Mr. Peña was as governor of his home state, Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">A populous state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">An honest man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he remembers fondly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">To reach the city can be lead by one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, a huge improvement compared with cracked roads and full of potholes that were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="17">You can also see name plates at the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope the interesting and real change to our country so desperately needs."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After a continuous period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unseated by Vicente Fox in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years of age outside the presidential palace at Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations to Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also rejects the characterisation that the opposition is of lack of essence of the new president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It is a very honest, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a fantastic man of state and, above all, is a person who knows listen. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that has many people on his former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as City Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be higher.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under sections of motorway high is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems of the borough are also tough and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier this year called for the intervention of the military to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, have been abandoned in just the past two years the bodies of dozens of women murdered.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 1,000 women were killed in the State of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for their violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Critics of Mr Peña Nieto say, at best, which failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.</seg>
<seg id="33">The most critics accuse the administration of turning a blind eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a house of concrete, typical of the neighborhood deteriorated, Irinea Buendía must make efforts to contain the tears while I shows photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Moon.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, his family believes that her partner the murdered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived home, it seemed as if he had cleared the body," recalls Ms Buendía.</seg>
<seg id="38">"There were signs that had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross which reads a single word: Justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, that is exactly what the family said that he has been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"I state authorities have treated as if it were an old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica.</seg>
<seg id="42">What they want is that you simply accept what they say and street. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"But that may not be the case where there have been so many irregularities and neglect," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the past six years and the new president has pledged to give them priority during his mandate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that this is the same kind of president who was when he was governor," said Congressman PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, that is exactly what the families of victims of Ciudad Neza more fear.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bradley Manning did not report abuse, according to state prosecutors</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Prosecutors seek to address the allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning in prison</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The trial focuses on the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defence wants the case dismissed on the basis that the imprisonment of Manning was severe</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The soldier in the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to report maltreatment which now claims that he suffered while in military custody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted to Manning in a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment she received.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The questioning, which took place during a hearing conducted in response to the request of the defence to dismiss the case, given that his detention was hard and that it had been sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he considered suicide while in custody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has not confirmed ever that Manning was the source of information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In view of the Friday, Fein revised with Manning forms that officers pad after visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where he was detained in maximum detention regime since July 2010 to April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The officers have carried out questions to Manning and annotated their answers.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the Friday Fein enquired about the forms, Manning acknowledged that she had described the treatment given to her by warders as "excellent" and treatment facilities in general as "very professional".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms show no denunciation of mistreatment, although officials asked Manning directly on the treatment they received, Fein said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and indicated that would be addressed, but that they not recorded in the register of these issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"Writing 'smooth' (after having spoken of problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked why not Manning had denounced the treatment she received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to discuss the intentions of suicide that had expressed in a form months earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of "injury prevention" under which he was.</seg>
<seg id="20">The military said that he had been put under that restrictive regime, which is a level below the surveillance possible suicide, to ensure their protection and safety of other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted the staff knew that I was well and (I) under injury prevention... to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison, located at the base of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait and that once lost consciousness due to heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said that the fact that she was not allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to the cage," explained Manning on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I thought he was going to die in the cage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Manning stated that, once transferred from Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning said that only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was prohibited to sleep or even lie down during the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning said that always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="31">He said that if guards could not see the face when it gave the return at night, raised him to return to turn round.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The lawyer of Manning presented in January 2011 a formal complaint about the treatment to Manning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after being forced a night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, they forced him during a morning count to stand in front of desdnudo guards and other prisoners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning had testified that he had never given the opportunity to be filled with the blanket during the recount.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said that deducted by the order that gave him the inspector who should drop the blanket with which could have been filled, but acknowledged that nobody had ordered the dropped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to show an officer that he posed a danger to himself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning said he had told the officer that could have used the elastic of his underwear or their flip flops for self harm but did not do so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell their underwear, his flip flops and his glasses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Their lawyers have the hope that the judge has at least into account experiences that happened during your stay in prison and drastically reduced his sentence if convicted in the court martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense said that plans to do that Manning was found guilty of minor offences and defend other allegations considered too extreme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and it is expected that prosecutors argue that conditions of detention were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules apply to all detainees under maximum custody in Quantico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, provoke illegally the publication of information on the Internet, leakage of information of national defence and theft of property or public records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If convicted of all charges, could face life imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="7">I was there a few seconds without being sure where should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having grown up in Central California, all my life I have called "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is shorthand ethnic, in the same way that my friends of Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends of New York define themselves "Italian".</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided on "Mexican-American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="13">American was simply.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish. Well enough to salir during an interview in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and I cannot get rid of my American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and I stood in the queue of foreigners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought at the time this week in which the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda of the day, as always to meet the leaders of these two countries, comprised: Immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Peña Nieto was willing to speak also the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why now is as likely to a Mexican remain in Mexico as they venture to go to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create in North America a trading bloc in the style of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue the fight against drug cartels in Mexico, but did not elaborate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to assign half its territory at gunpoint.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who believe in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that I recall are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So, in the moment in which a United States official said anything involving the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the elite, about how Mexican Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children of Moctezuma are up in arms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that it really is quite a challenge is the with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Are we talking of rancour?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is much.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, persons to whom the country provides opportunities for the other and that is not so.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason that so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, the father or the mother or any of the grandparents, to which he closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And most of the time that person fits in with a certain profile: Dark skin, a level of study under, from a poor people, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their downward and they are loyal.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mexico does not.</seg>
<seg id="35">And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we cannot never lose sight of that what we are seeing is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but it is our loyalty.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is for the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class people dislike us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over his shoulder as if we were of a lower level that is not sufficiently Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not been gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we would not be caught behind the curtain of silk, living well in the United States but, even so, as solitary souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when she was a girl, I remember that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know more who they are and the seconds this resent.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of any of the two.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love to hear the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico they see us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, to complicate things, so I have heard during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the work as Mexican-Americans "ambassadors of Mexico" improvised, representing their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We would say to our American colleagues awesome visit that country and presionaríamos to political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course...</seg>
<seg id="56">That is not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is too much rancour.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, with the wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I am afraid that you are going to be left alone with this idea, friends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still bitter about how his family was treated for a lot less time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps be more "Mexican" than I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a base unlikely for peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can he be some day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another bloodshed that suggests that any hope is in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in its ongoing conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has left everything made pieces like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uproar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that its deadly impasse could desencallarse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that neither is lost or earns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the optimism is now very difficult to justify.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have strengthened the hawks in both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say have forced Israel to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good kicking.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite having killed some of their leaders and to pressure the 1.7 million Gaza residents in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to stop Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its unrelenting rival Palestinian faction Fatah, the more moderate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, the leaders of Hamas could conclude that time is working in their favour.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a resurgent regional power which had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. So has Qatar, one of the richest states and dynamic of the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jubilant members of Hamas say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel from Lebanon to the north, where dominates the party-militia Hezbollah and Syria, where the rebels in an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Particularly in the south of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its demise in 2011, was not too long to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas emerge as protagonist who cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the hardliner wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">As regards the issue of Hamas military, have put in place.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Iron Dome missile system of Israel has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israelis most peaceful sleep... for some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas has initiated the latest wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">While the rockets fired from Gaza killed 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory contender to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite that, according to international law, are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Netanyahu, the Likud party has joined a group of an even tougher led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period before the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why pamper those twisted Palestinians with their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you really would govern in the West Bank, as rockets would not have done their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to have them after this wall and give them a good blow if raise their heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliner wing, while the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although Islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere have too much appreciation to Israel, its priority will be to address the internal difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defence budget of Israel is higher than that of its four Arab neighbours together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the superpower of the area is unlikely to help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should think in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, deprive Palestinians of their right to self determination involves creating a powder keg that one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a boost of people outside the conflict.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The solution remains the sensible people who preach from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which should start to curb the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Obama also has an important role with regard to make Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term failed to file its own plan for peace.</seg>
<seg id="52">Back in the White House, it seems just as reluctant to devote attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="53">This attitude is a deplorable vision.</seg>
<seg id="54">A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="55">This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.</seg>

<seg id="1">The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases look on green packets of a shutdown, which are the same for all brands of tobacco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Australian law on smoking and packaging generic, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replacing the logos and colors of markings for a wrapper of a shutdown olive green, a horrifying images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick as children of parents who smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the stricter regime of the world applied to the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia affirms that the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking through the elimination of the traits that make this habit has glamour.</seg>
<seg id="7">She hoped that studies show that if a person has not started smoking before the 26 years, there is a 99 percent chance that it never will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"You can see that children, even from a very early age, include the message that the company is trying to sell through their brand," said the Federal Minister of Health, domestic violence and homelessness 116 Protecting Indigenous women citing studies that showed, for example, how girls connected the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Despite that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes do not affect too to the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure against the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies said that the law would encourage the black market of tobacco, cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The legislation will have severe unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco, in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others say that their business has benefited following the adoption of the law.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for the typical and covered with silicone to plug the unpleasant images of the packs had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the High Court of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and retailers that was waiting for more stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">"For us is a good business."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the population sector to which the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of laws that prohibit the Australian television advertising and sponsorship of sports and forcing the majority of vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, the marketing of tobacco has to be made online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to companies and local websites, but cannot restrict cater.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If comercializas tobacco and only you have this small window to promote your products, the online space more convincing is the place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman noted an increase of reviews on brands from "ordinary people" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or if any marketing company is behind all this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on which implies a new policy that in marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has even pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recused themselves the new rules; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization which is restricting trade unfairly, though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is likely that the WTO a decision by mid 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek stated that the Government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on tobacco packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the year 2001, Canada became the first country to introduced the requirement to include images in the packs.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Currently are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering applying tougher laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In Australia, many smokers are challenging.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The photographs do not affect me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I simply not case. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"You take the cigar and guards the package," said Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Frankly, there is only one reason that would stop smoking: For my daughter."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack shop in downtown Sydney, indicates that the uniform packets make it more difficult to place them on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Usually took an hour in a desenvalar four slow delivery; now," says Yu.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world constantly connected, is not so bad a bit bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the festivities in Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half day stuck in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But there is growing academics and experts in child development that praise the virtues of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">According to them, it is good that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bored obliges the brain to find interesting options and can encourage creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Given that most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experienced the benefits of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So, should we accept in good spirits boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And not.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, as we will talk about that later.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, like many people, assumed that, now that we have more time to leisure, boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, as says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, a vibrant history") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, the history of the boredom is very long," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii there is graffiti in Latin on boredom dating back to the 1st century A.D.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We also need to consider how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The problem is that has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After reviewing the research literature and raise the idea to a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "hope, but not power, participating in an activity that fills you."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Affirms that the difference between the boredom and apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Notes that with apathy there is no desire to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The experience of boredom, says, is "the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom may sound terribly like depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are boring tend to see the problem as an issue of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed considered that the problem is with them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we believe that we are boring, when what is happening in reality is that we have trouble concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person who read the article in a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard in the adjacent room a television programme at top volume, unconnected, others heard with the volume low, so that was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear the audio in no time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The group that heard the program with the volume under showed more boredom than the other two groups; they cost focus, but were not sure why and how attributed to the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"When trying to concentrate on a difficult task or interesting, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a line of manufacture, a music that distract you can help you do not get bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"In fact, we know today that move or scribbles, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help to combat it, as do that person is physically more alert."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and more information than those on which they are forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all know what is bored at some point: The delay of a plane, a speaker monotonous, a film especially boring.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people are more likely to be bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of trend of boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes issues such as "many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I do not have time to do everything."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, alleges that, using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that is bored fairly easily.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human development and community of the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which contacted 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 per cent of adolescents said that while he was at school or doing their homework, while 23 percent said that when he was not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of boredom current, 21 years later, would be above or below.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he said that what we knew was that "adolescence is a period in which the boredom is at its highest point," largely because both children and adolescents are given a great control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, returning to my question the principle: Is good bored?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes it is not, because taken to extremes, can do that we expose physical risks absurd, as do bets or fall in consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as evidenced by the investigations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between the boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is the way that the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you ’ re bored and using that energy to playing the guitar or cooking, that will satisfy you.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you see television, it is possible that you will meet in the short term, but in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">"So, if your child is boring and you give an iPad, it may no longer be bored, but will not have learned to entertain themselves or dosificarse", says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "this capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations," he says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your son not only learn to chew itself, but learns how to be better controlled in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Colorado: Without instructions to the new law on consumption of marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, a student of 19 years in an institute community and footballer in southeast Colorado, is facing criminal proceedings for something that will soon be legal in all state: Possession of stones of marijuana and a pipe that used to fumarla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Orozco said that a day of September, he and some friends led by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when police stopped them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related articles (minor offences involving each fined $100 Americans) informing him of the date of the trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They treat us like criminals," Orozco said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">What are they?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of cases minors for possession of drugs depends less on the law of the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are cancelling both here and in the state of Washington, where they adopted a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police departments have ceased to bring charges against the older than 21 years for possession on a small scale, that will be adopted legally once the Act has entered into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors of more conservative districts of Colorado has pledged to continue the open cases for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent opened shops of marijuana, recently authorized, in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All this is changing so rapidly that I do not know what is to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Those who are responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington are also dwelling on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">And continue to seek advice to establish a system of licences of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline, 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">Say that, for better or for worse, Colorado goes ahead of most of the states in the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so this is a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Commission for the control of alcohol in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions as to what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is a real precedent that we serve as a model," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The law of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which is nadará between two stools, as the system of licences in the state still do not exist, but possession will be legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, there are some mechanical sensitive issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to offer a "access" to marijuana authorized and its prohibition of doing business of cannabis situated less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds for children or nurseries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Nowhere will be more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorized in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for cannabis legal, a research group created recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, Oates, the Chief Constable of Aurora, sent an email to their police officers in the informing them that the prosecutor of the city would bring proceedings for minor offences for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years and that the police would bring charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Chief Constable Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the regulations of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute and sellers of drug traffickers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his office would continue to pursue the cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and decide to receive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently, 119 persons face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, even though many of them have other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has the obligation to prosecute those offences at the time were crime occurred," said Mr. Buck in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response has been complicated, even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the county, no longer quotes adults for possession of small amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">Pete Hautzinger, County district attorney, supported that decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not think it is wasting time to continue to enforce the law to change," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, never considered that carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judiciary system would be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">Contradictory reactions emerging throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among the staff of the great experiment environmentalist in this state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"This is a cultural barrier with prosecutors of the district," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused for possession of marijuana and that is local voice of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have spent so much time taking people before the courts that, in fact, still cannot accept that is legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states that they consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become cases of test at the national level with regard to the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While lawyers and officials of the state have a new frontier of legal sale, also are looking forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still requires consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Proponents of legalizing marijuana are hopeful that the Department of Justice will subside.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed mostly any business of selling marijuana for such purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 states more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"Although it is likely that the drug agents not to pull down doors to confiscate a bag of drug small, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, as permitted under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of drug policies of the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities in Colorado will not wait for acting federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them may open.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the western town of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and it is likely that the approval of next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our community voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are studying what voted in favour of community responses to vote in favour of what voted the state. "</seg>
<seg id="47">Many questions arise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: "I had to go to Oxford as a Tory"</seg>
<seg id="2">Do not strike at the university by their views only now</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">I do not recall any time in my life that has not been dreaming in my seat at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the modern era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: The free thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, the two weeks of taking my place in the Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of History, had already made the bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed and she broke down in tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper The Evening Standard said that I had left because he did not tolerate that some fellow university kept sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because they forced me to drink in cups shucked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="11">I fled there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I fled, because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my bizarre name, nor the fact that came from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I harassed by a single reason, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Perhaps wonder about that now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students of centre right is suffering similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights of homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of students in grade) of Corpus Christi College claim that are often "seriously sections, personally attacked and treated as persona non grata" by their political ideas.</seg>
<seg id="19">Want to create a post in the committee of equal opportunities of his college to ensure able to express their views freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation was prompted by a recent documentary of the BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The paradise: Young, bright, and on the right) on the policy of students and presenting to the Tories as eccentric and neonazi.</seg>
<seg id="21">It showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with the grip of silver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, students conservatives say they are treated as "scapegoats" by the introduction of tuition fees higher.</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, of 20 years and Vice President of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of the left in universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, of 21 years and student of history in Corpus Christi that presented the motion for greater protection, argues that this atmosphere is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 and elected president of OUCA, argues that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre right has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of members," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During my first weeks in Oxford was more single that one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I entered college in September 1986, was a young of 18 terribly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous year, the university had voted refuse to Margaret Thatcher, former pupil, an honorary title "after" cuts in funding for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have made any horror to shudder of Stalinist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university, when new students are known and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that the professors not only did the blind eye to the mockery of academics conservatives, but participating in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The policy of the miners ’ strike, privatization and the government ’ s opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the halls of the seminar.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first thing that I should be translated into English French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what followed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (late), "please translate the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">Not di nor a.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt, a man shorty with a face that looked like sponge, knew how to expel bad bile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Do the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is that are simply stupid?" She asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other is a university.</seg>
<seg id="41">I burning eyes of tears that sought to contain.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest you go to French classes in his free time, provided that it is not too busy knowing people," gruñó Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to my room like a banshee.</seg>
<seg id="44">That night I sat alone for dinner at university; then I felt a slight pat on the back.</seg>
<seg id="45">He was a student of English second year called James presented as a member of the OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," told me politely.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I am afraid that this is how it goes the thing.</seg>
<seg id="48">They pick on anyone suspected of being Tory.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be even worse.</seg>
<seg id="50">Many Tories newcomers seeming to be Labour. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in a local pub, I tried to disguise cowardly.</seg>
<seg id="52">I emphasized that he did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick proved worthless.</seg>
<seg id="54">A student of first year of Philosophy, Politics and Economics which, paradoxically, she studied at Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of a pig fascist.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contaminated. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students took this ditty.</seg>
<seg id="57">I became the dirty perverted.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How do have sex the Tories?" Asked one.</seg>
<seg id="59">"There are beaten, right?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt the same way that should have been homosexuals before the law liberal of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">Could one day lead normal lives in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Am I obliged to meet people who think like me just after nightfall?</seg>
<seg id="63">Would that make me Labour and repress my natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years that I hoped were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">Is this to be not only of the Conservative Party, but also an adviser to Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">Barely was there.</seg>
<seg id="68">Hated the place by being parochial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you will not be happy," I said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to travel daily from Oxford home of my parents in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan mindset more open.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">I am not believed.</seg>
<seg id="74">When he was a student there in the 1940s, was accepted all political viewpoints.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But if it is the best place in the world," said with sadness.</seg>
<seg id="76">"They would never do this, not there between my beloved dreaming spires.</seg>
<seg id="77">To my friends always had an impeccable Communist attitude. "</seg>
<seg id="78">Their achy eyes started nublarse.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Dale another chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that have done so only for joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">I would split the heart if they desire. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had waived his creed.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week, during a seminar in which another Professor of History had intimated, speaking quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Cross shame inside, admití that my parents I had been "brainwashed" and called them "old stupid."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The truce did not last long.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my academic career in Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="88">Then my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I was in interest nestled of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors declined.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they did the suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never came back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">Perhaps I call weak llorona.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no one of 18 should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">What is even more tragic is that was Oxford, which not only has trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, behind a deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the occasion of the sample "Valentino: Master of Couture", which has opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host a presentation on Valentino Garavani.</seg>
<seg id="4">The designer has acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by their "house" over the past 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I adore this palace," says with its distinctive Italian accent.</seg>
<seg id="6">This shows is the culmination of a long history with the sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without honourable clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino has always fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, private letters and pictures with the signing of the most prominent of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.</seg>
<seg id="9">Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of their upward mobility: From humble city dressmaker Yosef, northern Italy, idol of the "international jet-set".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To be in love with royalty has nothing wrong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"At least not to shut down the butts of their joints on your magnificent carpet as do some beautiful celebrities of pop music", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">Valentino is a host spectacular and entertains with generosity and elegance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the exmujer of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.</seg>
<seg id="15">Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.</seg>
<seg id="16">And yet, is a star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charisma of the dressmaker.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his flat.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were twenty people, including were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.</seg>
<seg id="21">In every detail of the flat, decoration, food, music, everything looked and felt his spirit.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Each of the guests made us feel important and kind", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week, in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Never goes out of style because their designs are works of art," cap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Parade of lineage</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but loves well matched.</seg>
<seg id="26">He loves people with good education and titles, and they love it.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty metres long proposed a change of roles: The visitor takes the place of the models and must paraded through the gateway to accommodate a "dream" hearing that feature masterpieces of Valentino, as clothing that chose Jackie Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool coat and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.</seg>
<seg id="28">In that audience of mannequins shimmer names such as cave of Luxembourg, Gloria von German und Taxis, he-Marit of Norway, Rosario Sofia of Bulgaria or Habsburg.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Many of these clients claim that the first Valentino is as the first love, "impossible to forget."</seg>
<seg id="31">I remember it well.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "Gillette" and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection, 1971-1972.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was a gift that I made him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We prefer to him above others for their femininity, for his great love women, because enhances our beauty," added the former duchess of Fair.</seg>
<seg id="35">I like the colors that uses, have great light and are "donors" to the face.</seg>
<seg id="36">The proportions are perfect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The princess and prescriptora fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d 'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time I visited a Valentino.</seg>
<seg id="38">When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, dreamed of getting to the age and the opportunity to be able to use one of their costumes at night...</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally it came at the end of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="40">I bought my first Valentino dress for use at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was a red suit, with skirt of blowing, "corsage" drapery and décolleté word of honour.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d 'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="44">Princess D 'Arenberg keeps his clothes "party of the dressmaker with care... because a dress is not only a dress, also is the set of memories that entails."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The "king" fashion</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in your wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="47">It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as calls the dressmaker to their seamstresses) to develop the ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different types of lace and a queue of four and a half metres.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, titular of the specialised press that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">For years with the "Obnubilado moved-être" of the elite, Valentino is your best exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Ms. Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l 'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates many honors as any of the spouses of her clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"I have been struck by the refinement, its calm, its aspect spotlessly clean and perfect," acknowledges D 'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">The last time I saw was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was in the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.</seg>

<seg id="8">They know that any traspié could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist despeñó years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur mining</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once up, alongside the tourists that the photograph as if they were monkeys, circus and charging fatigosamente heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, to 1,850 meters of height.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that exploits the volcano since 1960 this time their workers, who pays 662 Rupiah (5 cents) per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder the sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As usual is load 70 kilograms, 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) in each trip," explains Anto, who usually three doors per day.</seg>
<seg id="14">It takes three hours in each and just ground, but allow you to combine 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, is triple what would gain in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The hire of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the coalface was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near volcano, for a good reason that, in Indonesia, is just as forceful as sulphur: "I married with a young woman of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java for that will convert to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously and irritate the eyes by toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">To his 27 years, Anto takes three playing his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass bill despite wearing a mask and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously and irritate the eyes by toxic gases that oozes the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">Is the price to pay to achieve his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work two years because I want to open a store or studying Spanish or French," promised in an English more acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished by life, this young intelligent and agreeable could be tour guide, waiter or a hotel receptionist, but rather that was the work of a mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing a unclean wood cabin with carriers, gets up every day to the two a.m. because sulphur is flowing at night, when its characteristic blue and yellow becomes shines in the midst of darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Defying the shadows, Anto drops to crater alumbrándose with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he has bought with their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some 400 porters load baskets of sulphur on his shoulders from the bottom of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite their enormous profits, the mining company has not mechanized mining of sulphur to save costs or provide any equipment to carriers, working on their own and to both the weight.</seg>
<seg id="28">Indeed, even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of surcharge for camera that, next to the entrance of Rs 15,000 (1.2 euros), this natural park rangers charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the beasts and not for people," protest Madrusin, a burly carrier of 42 years of his Kawah Ijen three decades, since leaving school.</seg>
<seg id="30">Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, ensures that abide working "everything" because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I am not retire, I will die a here because the volcano has been all my life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulphur burning throat and rankles the eyes when the wind changed unexpectedly and traps miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, are so tough that none complains of suffering from serious diseases... beyond, of course, of its usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knee and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balanceando the basket on her back, Unainik already can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his fellow start 15 tonnes of sulphur to the volcano, three trucks moved to Tamansari warehouse, 18 miles away on a path of goats in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I retire, I will die a here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where lacks several teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of their five children, the largest, 30, is also carrying sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but the misery perpetuated from generation to generation, one of the harshest in the world: The human mules that make the Kawah Ijen.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an announcement of pills of mint, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references as "We will put a Bao (bun) in the oven for" laugh at the birth rate of Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement to draw attention to the problem of a fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of the music to the people complies with "his national duty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This is purely Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that had to be addressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried to many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings of appointments (speed-dating).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why not do the most creative effort to resolve this problem, which is to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That would not do so lightly is the Government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Spent $1,300 per year in policies to encourage people to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A package of government to marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity and distributes tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time I was above 2 - known as reposición- rate was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why Singaporeans have no more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">So Wei Ming, Director of Policy on Marriage and Family of the National Population Division, said that is because of a "better education" and "a broader range of opportunities for career."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals, priorities and beyond to marry and start a family," he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase of spinsterhood, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to dramatically increase immigration to deal with the decrease in the population has created resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are websites with abundant xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical for maintaining low wages and not integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the governing party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with fees and levies higher for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unintended consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in the birth rate is known in economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also taking some unintended consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying not to be built so many maisonettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authority of urban development has grown to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box," could be built in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have areas of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of celibacy and discourage developers who want to build big houses, family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, said that its "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the larger units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Are more popular in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.</seg>
<seg id="40">This makes it much better for our cash flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, admits that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too stressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the birth rate, to speak with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of central seems that will not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing", said a young executive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Others may have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to make babies, Singaporeans are those who have the last word.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and graduated in Education and Learning, considers that to guide to children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is reporting.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet has emerged as a means to seek information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game," mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Batons notes that the academic Marc Prensky, Master of Arts in Education at Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined the terms to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives, they are children and young people who were born with technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are the digital immigrants that we need to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Says that the issue is complex, "because we are calling for them to have a definite attitude about what or not distribute, publish or tell an age that maturity does not provide for that."</seg>
<seg id="46">"That are also targeted when what matters is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them not to do so is not," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Below, Porras enumerates options: There are things that are not contarías to a stranger, why you do on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, do you want to publish a photo of yourself as you published a friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the other published on you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When labels photos of parties, would permit Quinceañera style to the others to label them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more, do all they need to know what you ’ re doing every moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is signalling that should act as they do online off line.</seg>
<seg id="55">Are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"One outside Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be in social networks," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Monitoring</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a university professor and consultant, professor of primary education, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly policies of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">To understand each of subparagraphs they have solid foundations to talk with your children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Guard, is key to remind children from "do not talk to strangers."</seg>

<seg id="8">The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents assistants, causing the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for further information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Subsequently, the President of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.</seg>

<seg id="15">"We shall abide by and execute the judgment that defines the differences that today we are taking this international court," said Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Chile has been, is and will remain a country that is respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, of treaties and international courts," added Piñera, and saluted with a handshake to Humala, together with the flags of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Confirmation of both presidents that shall be put to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week the Pact of Bogotá for which had agreed to submit to the findings of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua considered seriously wrong.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not be a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand Our productive matrix and look forward to a better future for our people," added Humala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border... joining our countries and generating new economic networks," said the Peruvian president in a message read.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Among these projects, mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the underlying themes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a closer connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details.</seg>

<seg id="28">"We hope that the electoral process in that country for its return to the Union of South American Nations", which is currently excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The need for Latin America remains as a region of peace and prosperity, integrated, and of good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before embarking on their participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with its pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat with respect the maritime controversy after a judgement of the ICJ, challenged by Bogota.</seg>

<seg id="10">He added that, in its time, "had suspected that Assange was extradited to a third country and does not respect for his process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He criticized, moreover, to the Swedish justice by demand submitted in its territory the questioning by an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation allows met through videoconference, that could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa stated that there is a risk of a deterioration in the physical and mental health of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken to him since that is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that I had a small problem lung, nothing serious," said the representative of Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">There is a danger that deteriorates your physical and mental health to be confined in a small space, without being able to do outdoor exercise.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It complicates the health of any person," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been discussions with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not negotiate with rights, that word does not use it in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because counsel of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European bodies," said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And suggested that "if Britain is just the pass this morning."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as perfectly permitting its legislation and as he has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interviewing via Skype tomorrow just this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa used to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and emphasized that it is "not tolerate mediocrity, the bad faith and lies, that detract from the freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians evil and evil but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In that regard was pleased that are no longer these journalists "or bankers or hegemonic countries and bourgeois which dominate in Ecuador," and said it "to be reelected refining revolution to continue the path and the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, to argue that the agency "must be firm and does not tolerate opportunism and the legality of coated" because in reality "shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Ecuadorian president considered, in addition, perfectly "relevant" to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now maritime boundary between the two countries after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment is not to comply with the judgement.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between a South American country and one in Central America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to come together.</seg>
<seg id="29">We must try them broadly to overcome them and move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also relied on a successful conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute that maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "is right for Latin America seek international bodies if the two countries agree to accept that it is hard for judgement."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In reference to the possibility that stand as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term noted that sees that possibility "with optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that if it loses the elections of February 2013 will be removed from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Personally I have never interested power, but in situations as unfair as the socioeconomic of Ecuador that poverty can only be corrected from political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My movement (believed it was I who ensured that likely victory, because we must accept that disconnected players regardless," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">To win would be my last period in the presidency and hence we go out of public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is a decision," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also referred to the new treatment of health of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have just spoken to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and tells me that travelled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Deaths from AIDS today are a cause of late detection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio had 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if I was a bomb", refers to relive the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to do "more suavecito", without clear success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy he hid his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Decided to take only of his illness and began to enquire about it; with such an endeavour that already celebrated his birthday 43.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the oldest of the patients HIV Unit Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until then, the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided bidding him because he had a "cut".</seg>
<seg id="9">Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignorant of his illness, still many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least for the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at the moment that the survival of a patient who began treatment in a timely and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infectólogo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system of patients to initiate the diagnosis, with better anticipation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years ago, when provide 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In simple terms, this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive to the 25 years of age, under these terms "while kept under control can live without problems until the 75 years," explained the interviewee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To measure this development, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May this year; however ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why deaths remain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - I think that the problem is not of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">They view, this has happened in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years have not been desabasto of medicine the problem is that patients are well advanced because they are unaware of their condition of infection, or, in the latter stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Gave a striking statistic: "Nine out of ten patients when they are already an opportunistic infection, what you have to do to have a greater impact on mortality is global, more diagnoses early and, therefore, we have to offer testing massively, to all persons who apply."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council for Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who turned out to be tested in a laboratory particular only motivated because it had a friend and, despite their young age, was already in stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi ’ s sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is a common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they are going to die and are not interested.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I am going to die, better I reviento three times a week, say" not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was to improve, I food well, I exercise, I take medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, as anyone.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have a sexually active, but shares, I care to me and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with GOALS WORK to motivate with his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Testing, if had risk, that between soon know whether they are HIV positive, and it is best if they already have the diagnosis, learn that can live as anyone, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">That, his message, summarized the motto of battle AIDS this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms after the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Great are the gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, journalist Tapatío who has taken the case about HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the greatest is in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places dedicated to this task "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is fine but there are those who today, yet, do not have access to a condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What the you?" Asked is common, with derision and value judgements of social workers, counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health workers, which does not want to expose adolescents, assured the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="39">Proposed redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only after the counters and those 100 are in our public baths of sites frequented by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nor it is paying the chelas and the motel, as did the governor Emilio Gonzalez, to ask whether distribution of condoms in his administration.</seg>
<seg id="42">"This is not sexuality, the best thing is to bring the condoms to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Keys in Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 1,317 AIDS and HIV).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state is fourth place nationally in new cases and 13 ° cumulative AIDS and HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92 per cent of infections corresponds to the sexually, 6 per cent to the blood and 2 per cent to the perinatal transmission.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV as by a case registered about 4 to 5 people who do not know.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ratified by an appeals court in the United States a ruling that he is unaware of the restructuring of the debt of the Grupo Vitro achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the stage is a harmful precedent for any company national ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It would seem, therefore, that the procedures in support of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">At a practical level, the boost to the judgement issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of bankruptcies in the northern district of Texas, left helpless to Mexican signatures for the seizure of their property in beyond the Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the resolution opens the door to the main manufacturer of glass in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">For a start, while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the Bankruptcy Law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings is the commercial competition in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would ignore the procedural cooperation in international insolvency cases of companies with transnational profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Indeed, towards this end, created the United Nations Model Law to Uniformity of International Trade Law, and arbitrator the American Law Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the ruling states that without the vote inter-company, recognized in the critical mass of commercial debts owed to its parent subsidiaries of Vitro, was not reached the majority required to approve the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the possibility the recognize Mexican laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, the Vitro has not been the first case in which accepts the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts inter-company endorsed the Federal Institute of Insolvency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The truth is, moreover, that subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have been majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote was 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The figure omits the Court of Appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another angle, it blames Vitro of the difficult situation faced by from 2008 to circumvention of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, where the barbs the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For one, the signing of the family Gonzalez Sada lodged an application for reconsideration before the court of appeals to the vote comes to full of it, that is to say the five judges, given that only voted three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">He does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the process of review by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The serious case is that the court ignored a document submitted by the Government of Mexico in the form of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, noting that this case involving in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to match it with Chapter 15 of the Law of bankruptcies of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Moreover, it states that the country surrendered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for transboundary cases of insolvency, guaranteeing fairness for debtors and creditors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After years of basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he travelled the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of local basketball history as broad as the is Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And is that before a stroke so confining a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of 28th, player of the National, proxy and leader in the BSN with Gorchakov of Bayamón or Basketball Federation president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I got many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Puerto Rico, where he resides with Elizabeth, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball has been my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes no exaggeration to make such a claim.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias, reflecting his long career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Fines in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of all, which holds more emotion are those that recall his passage through Gorchakov since the fifties as player until 1982, when it was 15 years serving as coapoderado or proxy of the franchise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Those were my best years, the more I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships Gorchakov since 1967, either as a proxy, coapoderado or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many years of satisfaction, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thereafter assumed "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham), told me: "You have a good player, of 6" 7 "of stature.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, which was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember Mincy said that if he had given a championship in Bayamon, Gausse would help bring a more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship with Gorchakov Gausse enjoyed it, but to the distance, since 1988 was already contained in federal kingpin.</seg>
<seg id="21">For that time preferred to enjoy their records and those of Mincy in the National Team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when he wins for the first time to the United States during the 1989 Preolímpico in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the 1990 World, where we came fourth place and should have been brass were it not for the Canadian arbiter that made us repeat the final hand for the second time, Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The group is that 1990 World is the best National Team that thou hast seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Is among the best, as he won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a pela the United States team, which was quite similar to that we won the bronze in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">The team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young people, to the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been in the 1990s due to a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that it was perhaps the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the del Preolímpico of 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players from role as "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, wins gold against all odds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And that is without counting his career in different leagues played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What you think your greatest achievement in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Having been part of the most glorious of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had until 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What you got to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things that I wanted to implement, as the regionalization of the 28th.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, boys in Ponce only playing in your area and only facing teams of other corners of the island in playoffs nationals.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now children travel and play too unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the fruit of certifications and compulsory course for leaders, officials and arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am pleased about that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The most I do is to listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme to my grandchildren and occasionally going to basketball games.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I know what I want in the tombstone of J. R.." Said Hagman, in 1988.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Initiated course that explores the "End of the world"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Each week, students explore topics like nuclear war, apocalyptic zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This semester, when the teacher in religion Stuart excellent Ep decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew that had a hook irresistible: An end to the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on 21 December, which stuck many people as proof that is the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But excellent Ep had no idea what I expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, where theorists Christians of the end of times believe that will start the Apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I realized that this was going to be the half more apocalyptic than has been excellent Ep," said this week to students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In Temple, the Associate Professor Barry Vacker is conducting the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world".</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week, students explore topics like nuclear war, apocalyptic zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We look at why these ideas are proliferating in time", he said, and the way in which offer some hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, may ignite a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month students discussed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how it compares with examples of real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have tried to educate students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have done team to teach a course entitled only "The end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We do not add any '2012' for always having the option of providing the course again, in the event that the world is not over," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generating projects and take final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students forced to work "to the same night that it is assumed that the world ends," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses were quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"It saturates in two hours," said Restall on his course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We receive messages via email for weeks and weeks prior to the semester of people who were asking if there was still a place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Students, for its part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It is fascinating to see what they do people to be consoled themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">And is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the lack of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, 25, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I enjoy it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of 21 December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project focused on the Mayan prophecy and in some ways it denigrates," said Julie Zeglen, student of last year in Temple, 21, of West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has led to a boom in these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Elsewhere people do not think about this," he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">In mostly in the anglophone world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Gregory, a professor of religion at the University La Salle offering courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew on a course on the "end of the world" there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon by the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall noted that over the years has been spoken of many days of reckoning, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will begin to think immediately in the next stage" or to philosophise that on 21 December is the start of a period of seven years after the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers were being taken lightly date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several said they think go to parties "of the end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Maybe call some friends to riamos together," said Samira Ford, student of communications for 20 years.</seg>
