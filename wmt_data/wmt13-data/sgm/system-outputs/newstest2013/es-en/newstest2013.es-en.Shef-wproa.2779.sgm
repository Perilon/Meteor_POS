<h1>
<seg id="1">A strategy Republican hinder the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Leaders Republicans justified its policy by the need to fight ballot-rigging.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, the latter Brennan believes Centre a myth and says the vote-rigging is less frequent United States the number die of fall lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of fact, lawyers Republicans have not found more 300 cases of electoral fraud United States ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here, these measures will undercut partly democratic system American.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada, States Americans are responsible for the organisation federal election United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">And a majority of governments Americans enacted, from 2009, new laws still hampering registration process or vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has spread after the elections November 2010, the increasing 675 new representatives Republicans on 26 States.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently, during 2011 introduced 180 projects bill restricted the right of vote on 41 States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters present a identity document with a photograph, also proof non-citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these laws cut periods early-voting, maim the right to register as constituent the of the scrutiny and withdrawn their right to vote citizens with criminal records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections 2006, no state American required voters submited a document of identity with photograph.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rule Indiana first it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court confirmed at 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">On recent years these authorities have supported projects in 34 States to force voters to present a identity document with photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Is important take account of, the contrast to Quebec US citizens not have a document, as the card universal identity Social Security.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, 11% of citizens Americans 21 million of voting age, have no identity document with photograph issued by a government agency of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, five million new constituents 2012 lacking identity document with these characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="21">, but often, required identity costs document more 100 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With which, the new restrictions affect disproportionately the young, the minorities and persons low-income.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of persons earn less than 35 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of between 18 and 29 not have identity with photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And even more.</seg>
<seg id="25">On many states students, voters more vote candidates democrats, cannot use the document of identity with photograph your institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, these States authorise members of clubs or hunting tend to vote party Republicans to use documents issued by such clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004 no state demanded proof citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state in present this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011, a dozen States has adopted laws which require voters are showing American people.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures seek, clearly, limit the vote Spanish matter.</seg>
<seg id="31">Seems two every three constituents Hispanics support the party Democrat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, legislators Republicans supported 2011 certain laws abolishing entered constituents the same day of scrutiny eight States.</seg>
<seg id="33">Furthermore, cramping the right of people and groups create a service of assistance voters to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, general elections 2004, campaigns of registering voters contributed the registration of around ten million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">Measures adopted since 2009 achieved rate of registering new voters into 2010 compared with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Furthermore, legislators Republicans adopted laws others five States favouring period for the vote by advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example elections 2008 Florida, 33% voted for advance voters were African-Americans, while recent accounted for but 13% of state voters.</seg>
<seg id="39">For Hispanics occurred exactly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Is 11% of voters, a 24% of citizens vote for advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">However, whites, which represent 76% of electorate, not represent 46% of citizens vote for advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, legislators Democrats and their supporters objected fervently to adopting laws which restrict the voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Here, governors Democrats have blocked several projects bill.</seg>
<seg id="44">The prosecution US intervened to suspend laws more controversial.</seg>
<seg id="45">Was,, to limit damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 34 States adopted the law demanded the presentation a document identity with photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, is undeniably the new rules adopted complicate the right vote on 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics Democrats denouncing the party laws voted, since it is clear with be influence the results 2012 the key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Centre Brennan 2011 shows States which have adopted such laws represent 171 of the necessary 270 votes polling achieve Presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Is too early to say with certainty if these legislative changes city-wide electoral system significant will impact the presidential election results 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">A thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.</seg>
<seg id="52">Here, measures will undermine partly democratic system American.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The bosón details Higgs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of likely discovery of bosón Higgs generated consternation last summer, and with right.</seg>
<seg id="3">, the bosón is involved mechanism responsible for the mass all on the universe, nothing less.</seg>
<seg id="4">And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our better or 'less bad' explanation of nature and the behaviour, has not yet been noticed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But to physicists not clearly be Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">Know undoubtedly a new particle and resembles the bosón Higgs predicted by the model standard.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, new data revealed this week a important congress physics concluded Kyoto appear confirm is, although still more data to be safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">All ways presumably is Higgs, already that the possibilities mistake seem to few. See what.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is great world, a law and inevitable widespread involved that two things not the same place the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">No way of infringing and not this rule try too, because will getting damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although physics particulates is a world very complex, proved in it there a law of these characteristics: the principle exclusion Pauli, stipulating two particles cannot occupy the same space simultaneously if are same “state quantum '; a'" state consisting, broadly some of characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Physicists fall particles two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">By a part faced with good citizens so-called fermiones supporting wisely the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">And are the bosones, a dirty bunch of anarchists not has respect for nothing, or not by this principle, which means on the same place and the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the website The Particle Adventure of Laboratories Berkeley which is extraordinary, the bosones fall into two: the groups landlords, not discuss here, and the 'particles force', for which the large forces of nature spreading and with which the bosón Higgs would some form relative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosones, might emphasize are not the gruesome creatures exotic we could believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">Indeed, if achieved read this chronicle, is thanks to a bosón extremely banal: the fotón or 'particle light' acts as' messenger 'of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when a particle with a burden electric accelerates or changes direction, 'repeatedly' the field electromagnetic at the environment; a little as when launched a stone to a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This' mess' begets a wavelength electromagnetic (of light the infrared, the ultraviolet, etc) and this wavelength is not a fotón; namely one of the bosones' bearers. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Field stable more</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same Higgs bosón, is other field, the field Higgs, which needs be 'disorderly' to this appear bosón.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, the field Higgs is much more stable the field electromagnetic. For be needed to energies activate extremely high, a little as a icy pond which only a higher rock could glide by the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore lacking immense accelerator of particles as the CERN (the great Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to achieve such standards energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the field electromagnetic is a new tool explains the relationship between the Higgs and the masse.</seg>
<seg id="25">Not all particles or all materials interact with the field electromagnetic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, as magnets, do, but other not: a piece of part, for example sustained never alone clung to the door of a refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the same way, not all particles interact with the field Higgs: the do have a masse, while the rest (how the fotón, incidentally), not the have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Now, what 'can make' all such research?, question Madam Plamondon.</seg>
<seg id="29">For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS) and, furthermore, physicists escrutinen differences between the comments and the predictions of MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">For its part, many want fervently, because the lower difference could open a door to a 'new physical' tape model certain holes.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, has still major gaps as not explanation proposes on the seriousness (UPS!) or dark matter, which is around 80% of the the Universe (another UPS!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But not have found such differences on CERN until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Repercussions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Impact of such investigations our day-to-day are difficult of predict, but not believe mistake to say which will have no.</seg>
<seg id="35">To see: the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers laboratories not suspected the result revolution its work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Entreveían applications scientific, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked laboratories Bell, where invented lasers on 1960, and by the first continued lasers (the first were pulsados) 1962, the principle lasers was rather considered a 'laboratory apparatus'.</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And applications also can also proceed throughout the orchestration surrounding research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a captador light on 1969 during their research optical.</seg>
<seg id="41">Despite was no its original intention, this captador serves now 'eye' to all digital appliances the world, which Award Nobel physical 2009.</seg>

<seg id="47">And several bodies, as the heart Victor-Gadbois and society palliative care door-to-door of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively care of cancer patients.</seg>

<seg id="10">All is very rapidly in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I not I acaloro.</seg>
<seg id="12">From my early in central preformación of INF Clairefontaine to my step Saint-Etienne, always I advanced leaps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Will profit competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">The recruited this summer are accustomed to play parties very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">Know each training is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This makes a player as I keen to fight and disseminate all.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much on my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Is supported by attached as Claude Makelele, which played in the same position I.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Ancelotti is the man needed the team?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, no one equal in the League 1 and is between the best trainers European.</seg>
<seg id="23">Has a great experience and won many titles the better clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">Has worked great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">Believe to be other degrees Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January had a conversation very comforting with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had out of a number injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Faith me also explains my good performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What does on the GSP the first part season?</seg>
<seg id="30">On the League 1, Lyon we took the leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our major objectives is the League of champions: we classified for the eighth end with style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the objective of club this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We reach out the further possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now, anything.</seg>
<seg id="36">But have great deal with many and very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want, to start, end the first of our League the Oporto to receive round eighth of end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The GSP can become a great European club short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">Already has the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and be there long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Economic, the GSP is delivered their means to this project actualization.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not win the glass on the League 1, like last season, constitute a major failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we will invest all our efforts in lead this title of champions.</seg>
<seg id="46">The last season not we far.</seg>
<seg id="47">On May we take a disappointment, as had optimum conditions for finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">Had a season strong.</seg>
<seg id="49">We with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points should have been champions...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, the Montpellier, had a season quite better.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year believe the good.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the major equipment as the Marseilles, the Lyon and the Bordeaux fight for the title, think we have arms to llevárnoslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Does the media expect more of GSP?</seg>
<seg id="55">Is normal to wait much of us considering what was spent on players that have.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accepted entirely.</seg>
<seg id="57">After we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, which still with things criticise is a little frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what more expected the people.</seg>
<seg id="59">Can never win 4-0 all weekends.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not are the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We a project off-side.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">The League of champions have shown we can respond and be present.</seg>
<seg id="64">Talk Manchester City, after two seasons, has not achieved qualify for eighth of end, and they also invested greatly!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the sums invested, imaginaríamos with 15 points of advantage to the day.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would neglect our adversaries and the championship France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseilles, not were well the season previous, have been 'driven' by this new GSP.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows the League 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I can say with May smiles, despite all the difficulties end taking the trophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The GSP seems perfectly resource-dependent success Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Better than say we a 'Zlatandependencia'.</seg>
<seg id="72">This means Ibrahimovic is very competent and burying many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Has been to demonstrate the star the League 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">And has shown in all the teams for past is a great player, a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">The group respected man and the gambler.</seg>
<seg id="76">And he also respects men has around.</seg>
<seg id="77">It genuinely exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This pushes the other to increasing its level.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of world, also allows all progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How you lived Euro 2012 with the team of France?</seg>
<seg id="81">Has been a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">Was very enthusiastic by participate in this Euro.</seg>

<seg id="84">Saw things there and left strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today achievement play selection good parties.</seg>
<seg id="86">Is what expected from my baptism with the 'Bleus'.</seg>
<seg id="87">Learned the lesson of what spent Ukraine and this must be today have exemplary.</seg>

<seg id="95">Hopefully Didier Deschamps carried selection Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The standoff (1-1) of 16 October Spain served to the foundations?</seg>

<seg id="3">While Egypt is more divided than ever on the statement constitutional, gives provisionally powers plenaries he play decided the all the.</seg>
<seg id="4">Took everyone by surprise the Wednesday, when announced the Constituent Assembly vote its text end the following day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only a week, the Head of State gave two more months to this House to finish its work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And almost two years Egypt uses a text provisional several times modified, what weakens institutional stability and judicial entanglements.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative failed the fractured the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For its opponents, President persisting its' delirium autocratic 'and continues' betraying its word 'and' trampling the right '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">By part supporters, ensures to be a finally faster with the institutional crisis and policy and accelerate the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next 15 days should organise a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time obliging the Brothers to renounce their project explain the text article by article, Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For President is a way to regain legitimation popular and democratic while the controversy ravages around the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced Egyptians will vote for it, as a interview the American weekly Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recital the resource voted rapidly, contains a ultimatum to the Egyptian people: 'or vote my text or full powers maintain the', powers supposedly will its order with the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Is this environment strange where 85 Members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist its large majority, voted the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals not went to the convening.</seg>
<seg id="17">To mid-November, a little earlier statement constitutional, had closed the door because felt could not assert its views.</seg>
<seg id="18">The human rights representatives religious minorities and civil society did the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">To achieve the quorum, last tomorrow added to 11 people, members substitutes, hastily.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Brothers Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="21">Unsurprisingly, Articles voted have been unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators makes them grace, furthermore, a of the few discrepancies times voiced virtually to prayer, is several committee members arrived think the clock badly Constituent the.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text yesterday afternoon was still remains voted, 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2, the spotlight, remains Constitution finally identical to 1971, which stipulated 'the early Sharia are the main source the right'.</seg>
<seg id="25">Parties Salafis, for those establishing Islamic law is a vindication fundamental, expected it could replace 'the principles' by 'the rules', what had allowed a implementation stricter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To Islamists, this article was not amended is a guarantee its goodwill and its respect for the others components of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">The liberal denouncing of hypocrisy and consider it is only a advertising trick.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Relate especially Article 220, which gives al-Azhar a consultative role University, particularly for anyone who has of confirm its laws of Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist Egypt Sophie Pommier is disturbing because 'people so-called to Rule unelected and has no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here see the premises a theocracy '.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fears Liberals are also increased by next rector of this university be rather less moderate the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">'For now, no a involvement specific religious.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution are under the civil status.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most jurists who have working on this text university but are not ulamas, some of them taught system French ', explained Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thesis on the constitutional transition Egyptian.</seg>
<seg id="36">But recognises can be some ambiguity on Article 220, because the terms imitate employees vocabulary religious.</seg>
<seg id="37">'We refer specifically term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].</seg>
<seg id="38">And the question could future would what extent are judges competent civil to pronounce above all this'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its church-based, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms relate to the powers widespread which confers the chairman of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Brothers Muslims will argue we are few compared with which were during the earlier regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another sticking-point: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">Under the wish the military, the budget review not be put to Parliament but to a national Council defence.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nor banned prosecutions of civilians on courts military, as asked associations for human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These also showed their concerns about the text, which consider liberticidal.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, of now on, insults are banned, could have serious consequences for free expression, particularly the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Furthermore, no Article emphasises protection of women, emphasises Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">This day, some workers Walmart the corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs pickets of and contained protest together with the unions and activists left-wing shops the corporation, whose products to people modest income moderate and.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all, from nappies, rifles hunting and batteries for cars, until aspiradores, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products at its stores are average between 8% and 27% cheaper the of the major supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is why many workers underpaid of Walmart buy only at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and mix products have fact Walmart a corporations larger America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products very low-priced, partly because paid little to their workers.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">This' Friday Black the involved demonstration demanded increasing salaries and complained the cost health-insurance provided by the corporation spent 30 to 100 monthly.</seg>
<seg id="18">For a typical worker of Walmart, receiving 9.5 dollars per hour, this expenditure is excessive, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists University of California at Berkeley argue if Walmart increases the average until 12 $per hour, this will cost Corporation 3.2 trillion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is approximately 1.1% more what spent wages now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart places the increase wage the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will be only 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">A year them spend the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more what now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart told satisfied the protest took place only nine States and it no loss to the corporation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 'Friday Black continued in their shops from the 8 Thursday afternoon until midnight following day, and during this time, Walmart sold around 5,000 articles by second.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of the company Dan Fogelman, declared interviewed the website of left Huffington Post, left their jobs' less five 'employees Walmart and the protest had not been' another public relations trick ', organised by workers Union.</seg>

<seg id="27">'Box free!'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued New York this week, the objectives were not precisely stores Walmart (this progressive town not them appreciation, and why now no), but the 'McDonald' and others restaurants cheap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Let McDonald says which sells billions of portions, and then even you give sick and not you pay for your work honest!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, Council member Municipal New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, agree with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is of 7.25 $.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast-food restaurants are increasing with time, but only slightly, and average, ordinary workers receive New York 8,90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody earns less they.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How survive New York with this money, for me is incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when almost quarter of adolescents US derided for the McDonald and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school yet lived with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few were the saw this as the main income planned or stay there long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, constantly failure in interviews with workers McDonald who complain for of this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal a comment whose points out it irresponsible bear children if not know with what to eat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Players protests, which began to 6: 30 Thursday morning the McDonald of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded the tellers and cooks fast-food they start pay for least 15 $per hour, they double its minimum wage current.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also demanded sector fast-food of the creating unions workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The law of the US prohibits the administration prevent this right and punish activists unions with skulduggery and redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="42">Furthermore, rarely it administration life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But, for objective reasons, is easy unions cover the sector food rápid.</seg>
<seg id="44">A major staff is the excessive rotation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discordant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place this same day others restaurants cheap Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of action rally took place half McDonald the near Times Square, involving several politicians local democrats, particularly the Council member Municipal the city Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald says is selling billions of portions, and then even teaches you a hospital or you pays for your work honest'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Demonstrators received the support of other highlighted Democrats New York, for example candidate to Mayor of the city Bill of Blasio, which said 'must support workers fast-food sector receive to achieved fair wages and economic prosperity deserves each neoyorkino'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described the newspaper New York Times, this was the greater demonstration such American history of the fast-food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But few involved hundreds people even, not all were employees fast-food service, where trabakan tens of thousands New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Is not yet clear if this will spark to cause a mass movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">'For now, deceive the brain is not easy'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The issue of reality improved so popular among fans to technologies modern, late perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">To early summer, annual conference Google showed a model movement and subsequently, November, it transpired Microsoft tabled also a request to claim the corresponding patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, a conversation with chief interactive technology 3D the laboratory Cambridge Microsoft, Izadi Sharamom, was illuminating to scientists this company glasses already belonged to a stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">To them attracts the perspective manipulation of objects virtual on air with the hands naked and the creation spaces open virtual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please generally what is the studied its research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are the interaction persona-ordenador, but we extend the limits of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now humanity its mass has been stage trapped work pixels of the screen flat, sometimes the is the finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">But we looking 5-10 years forward and guessing the changes in this interaction cardinal.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the console Xbox and sensors represent a step Kinect and today no Xbox sells without Kinect, already interested all control by gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- what more the future holds?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite led Kinect interaction physical the level, much of this still happens on a screen flat, to times 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction information has improved (the system receives more), and exit still is not very good.</seg>
<seg id="14">Are seeking to change systems this, work imaging really three-dimensional, based on different technologies, including the of design.</seg>
<seg id="15">Must ridding the world computer the our, the physicist, more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this, however, is necessary acknowledge the user, but also the area.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then can complete the real world with objects virtual a more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Firstly, the devil with these fools helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- what you think about control by voice?</seg>
<seg id="20">A detail very popular, but not believes it over-estimate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- surely not can consider a panacea, remains resolving, already privacy not always wants others listening of our actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own area.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices into public places, had a project that consider gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, gestures were caught not by the Chamber of the device but by a wristwatches which had the movement of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">For now, but theoretically can be reduced the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, overall, the future is for combined control, for example gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- how this is?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- Of example, how I ask you forward this tin of Soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will and the shows the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Normally I only speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, this will be hard recognise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- or is, you to force users adapt to what can or cannot do the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- not necessarily, but is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="34">Believe a future next we have to work design mainly new types sensor to determine precisely the reactions.</seg>
<seg id="35">These can be, for example sensors already lasers, which provide a good resolution in-depth, what is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If we his work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what complaints you cameras modern?</seg>
<seg id="37">Do you lack resolution, thoroughly or more?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, the current generation is what can be the start of our work with the recognition three-dimensional.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, be good 8 megapíxeles to the speed 1000 fps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But issue is not the megapíxeles but on quality of the matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From this last view, all existing technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives more work designers of algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or is, we must remind not only the resolution on axes X and and, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Is also important speed, the number scoreboards by second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for the gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond, sensor contact with retardation processing adjustable 1-100 Ms and mention that modern sensors produced serial are closer the second value 60-100 ().</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everybody understands how much this affects the interaction hombre-máquina.</seg>
<seg id="47">I be very useful for my work equivalent of such device but not require contact to datasheets by second more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- and is not need to increase the number cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The Kinect now has three 'cameras', a of which is the issuer of infrared and the second recipient the signal reflected.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the third chamber is actually a simple sensor of standard visible.</seg>
<seg id="51">This is not used to determine depth of subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or contrary, increase it and increase amount required calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">A, play analogous flexible Kinect with the curvature of location cameras and see how this would help determinr the position three-dimensional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- Concerning I recall Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Does view of daily use of technologies reality increased, glasses are a platforms more visible?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">-, everything the time holding a smart phone the hands, is not oh-so-comfortable, but I: the better option would be a reality increased 'transmutable' when, basis of a platform of cloud, you could move of glasses the smart phone,</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses are devices very personal, this is its strength (things private only you can see them), but also its weakness: a reality increased based on glasses not will work on objects with others virtual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- imagine if manipulation objects virtual holográficos air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film 'Iron Man', but also for any simple deadly.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem in this idea critics often point to: must táctil response!</seg>
<seg id="61">The not feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answer prepares its Group for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my conferences often say the reality increased is the seventh arrival on the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">Believe the eighth could well be the addition of sensations tactile.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second-hand as support for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It records tact perfectly!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies which are genuinely aimed to provide tangibilidad to these 'images on the air'. For example, interference several rays ultrasónicos to a specific point the finger gives a sense similar to one feels if someone was soplándole the buds of, but this feeling is still very weak.</seg>
<seg id="68">Also bracelets to the doll influencing nerve endings detect tissue of the fingers, this also a direction promising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- has addressed fooled the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Is to think he feels what should feel the moment sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- That is a good idea, still we have not tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lurks another challenge to we fight long, how to a person physically located a very reduced creates that will a open space, almost without end. Are also working on the idea of the tapes run (not as the of gyms), mobile platforms, as the balloons giants.</seg>
<seg id="73">For now, deceive the brain is not easy, are still work years.</seg>
<seg id="74">Is what is work with virtual reality for researchers, many things are a state total conception.</seg>

<seg id="9">Furthermore, is a urban, whose appearance on the city streets of the inhabitants smiles and lifts all the mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, took their a organillo and became the San Petersburg, already organillero has matured to difficult role Bohemian, for their existence, their philosophy and its image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why go by the city bluefin dress and not yellow or turquesa, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- chose the red colour because I fashion designer and I dedicate to the appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">This world the red colour is a compromise between the artist, creators images and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although society, everything which is not a little grey raises aggressiveness and turmoil good properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are addressed unleashed a conversation.</seg>
<seg id="16">History my action provocative are a invitation the debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - when comprendiste which debías be artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - In exposure of Culture Nevsky, where they my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I realised this was my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the wave of old artists unofficial had over, and the new, free as I, were still incomprendidos.</seg>
<seg id="21">I friend artists of the new wave, with the after the outlined Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to 'Pushkinskaya-10', and already ended the new wave.</seg>
<seg id="22">I sumí the theatre for clothes, music all the genders but not letters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> And all this coupled on your Clínica of art... - To me was important be on the cultural centre San Petersburg, where were the best minds creative.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 1995, I territory Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while not had reforms, existed a club artistic musical, a club bohemio, the House of Bohemian San Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember how brought the project Schnur to 'The ear of Van Gogh'.</seg>
<seg id="26">Schnur and friends danced songs light under phonogram, vestían trousers tight, between them was the currently composer fashionable Igor Vdovin.</seg>

<seg id="35">These is not work new times comfortable; I a man likes the truth honesty and the culture of last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our is times easy to popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but little worship.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Very of my paints are hits, which clearly expresses present and the occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="39">Going to make a exposure scheduled, 'The Russian Museum on clowns'.</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns are a status timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">I was accessible, but now be is painful and frightening.</seg>

<seg id="49">Who better than I to be!</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="59"> - Van to see the abandoned, there it the field sexo-social.</seg>
<seg id="60">And a cultural event are 300 people, ten thousand never come. As result, less management, less money, all withering.</seg>
<seg id="61">I my fan, more important is not hoodwinked, not spoil what you achieved.</seg>
<seg id="62">When was young was such tables to a art-collecting the tapeworms strung on the wall alongside Falk and Larionov.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with paints, with which people usually ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often confuse the concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">Say culture spiritual, culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">No culture, this is another story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example artists living in poverty and died poverty refused the money only to paint pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I this culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, what lacks San Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - Buenos experts culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is a concept: officer culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all can work culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">When kings were right all was differently kings perhaps not comprised well culture, but knew need maintain experts courteous.</seg>
<seg id="74">Moscow now there is very good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">Have people St Petersburg well could be experts, but are closed, because need to a experts top-level correctly assess they and I open path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now is thriving the personal taste subjective.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but the difference is they say honestly not art modern is accepted, some artists who must seek others museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - what is for you San Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - San Petersburg not a capital cultural. Moscow much more culture, there ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">But on our stones is difficult art grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">Need cultural and have now more writers readers, it.</seg>
<seg id="82">Europe is a lot of people with curiosity will exhibitions and concerts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Leader NKÚ: the inspection of system švarc 'has not the political guilty</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and legislation quality, although implementation feeble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Says so Miloslav Kala, Vice-Chairman of the Control Office Supreme (NKÚ) a interview to Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The law will never perfect ', but implementation must be correct.', my opinion, what we lack 'describes the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The joint controls inspectors Czechs and Germans also reach conclusions similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As example practice incorrect, mention attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system autonomous only be on the role, known as the system švarc '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The first Minister said recently the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) not would employers with inspectors. Then, is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">The law must be regulated somehow and if prohibits something,, government nor the President can prevent action office must make such checks and require obligations', Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the committee meeting control Congress of Deputies, you spoke team between the common project Czech and German, the context of which compared the legislation the award public both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is exactly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Is a control parallel we make some two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Said simplified: European legislation regularises how to organise the award public, this is existing legislation each country and then the praxis itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have united all and, although the control is not finalised, achieved differences very interesting. Generally, legislation of our country is' stricter and more complete ', however, the praxis specific parameters is better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This therefore confirms not enough with incorporate rules ever-tighter, but is must focus on law enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What can make fact this project? what believes that are the conclusions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Common control of this kind could contribute to importance investing efforts applying laws, reduction and improvement limits, although this not impacting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy savings means achieving a appropriate thing reasonably-priced (what not always mean the price is the lowest) to prevent enrichment, and eventually, action criminals.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact reduce the limit award means we this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps because the system is saturated so 'red tape', those want to find failings will system easier if maintained limits as high as now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You discussing the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the prácticaa of the award public.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system controls Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is an office like our NKÚ or organises differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">How bureaux, as the NKÚ, there acts Bundesrechnungshof the (Federal audit), with a organisation similar to our, with a college also, all is it is structured the both different, but principle both offices develop parallel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also competences are to some point analógas, but, as Germany has a organisation federal, courts all are even this level. Here differs slightly of our system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only monitor the federal money, what here call state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, administered by regions and municipalities, there, Germany, control the Federal Audit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">On local legislation, is simpler the our?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally not I would comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model some aspects, but cannot be state exactly what is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Could be better, for example, on quality inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This certainly not, but, repeat, I like do such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">Is be said even those countries take as model face a large number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">If not not I would no benefit cooperate with our office, does not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Regarding legislation of our country, what meant to its Amendment law on the public procedures manifest? somehow its incidence?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given the validity of this amendment is relatively short, not said control activities.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we controls ex-post need a delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For now, notes the preparation process of future controls: initiated a 'new tool detecting risks non-economic', we fact 14,000 procedures nearly public have been analysed. Changes will perfectly reflected here, already amending the limits, are some types of conditions selection process and similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Does the approval of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a imbroglio to the bureaucratic system?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I believe this law is certainly a right step hope so. And</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise is rules tighten '' and impossible deliver.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the previous rules, persons controlled were linked the contractor (for example, regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and every law on procedures respected not public meant rape of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Does then sense toughen the law of this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Believe not this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those to attacking or exploit he and not punish those commit a failure formally, not has incidence decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system only achieved create greater bureaucratic pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how exceeds this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">See where leads this road begun.</seg>
<seg id="47">The first minister recently declared that the ODS not would employers with controls the so-called system švarc, with reference to fact be autonomous only on the role. What this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">The system švarc 'is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be regulated somehow and, if prohibits something then even the first government minister can prevent action Office to must make such controls and require obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Can say: 'change the law and we allow' but cannot say we as if nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">On law on the award public, regulation is rather strict terms of must act formally. And as must be to protect public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, furthermore, is tragic exclusion candidate with the better supply not meet the formal requirements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never perfect, but implementation must be correct. This is my opinion, what.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Equipment for the Centre education barrier-free Studeo, term in its sixth year running civilian with partnership TAP Jedličkův ústav.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pupils school Jedličkův ústav are regularly the visit of teachers with the amusing and interesting performing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pupils not have sufficient resources to pay teachers and we efuerzo to this.</seg>
<seg id="29">Within the framework completion of the Jedličkův projects ústav be a building independent we move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Each concert several groups acting and interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="31">What are the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We drawing up a programme is attractive to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example Prague act Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">To more details consult www.kpks.cz. you,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Is You scheduled some other 'action spectacular' similar future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">First proceed in May in the festival Pražské jaro, so here surely prepare a attractive programme with guests interesting.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year we would also play Bohemian the National Hall New York and personally while we United States, I would amplify with action Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, until now have acted for example Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The TAP TAP, however, is a group disabled.</seg>
<seg id="40">How is logistics and organisation of these journeys?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is not as difficult how can appear.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five Members wheelchair, the chairs must travel compartment to baggage and we much weight, boxes with the instruments...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, until now we managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly ready, which it puzzles me.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even Moscow, where we returned recently, went all without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the various attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you you have found?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, all works better than here; in Russia we witnessed, this, is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Unlike Prague, Moscow is full barriers, there remains frequent be a person moves single by the city centre to a wheelchair electric.</seg>
<seg id="49">Something as and is, for example, give preference someone on wheelchair on lift, there is not.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, a civil partnership strives to focus attention the problems of the disabled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">What aspects must take example of most progressive countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Many aspects in we behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But is important to mention perfecting and the improvement depends always of persons directly.</seg>
<seg id="54">On London and Madrid is very normal people with a disability serious switches alone in public and can go to the museum, wherever...</seg>
<seg id="55">But is not very common which a large number of disabled participate in social lives actively here with The TAP TAP it a step ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">A society respectful or without barriers is a thing, but when the moment arising eminent sportspeople, artists, players political or lawyers begin to change everything.</seg>
<seg id="57">Until now, are isolated cases of people have a great willpower.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The TAP TAP is currently popular, but looking years backwards, what you led to form the Group in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Entered carer as on Jedličkův ústav, where was quite young people my around wanted engage something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I musician, raised, others saxofón the founded a group amateur with a colleague.</seg>
<seg id="61">And with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we was a little hands (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">However, the popularity not to recent years, or I mistaken?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Is truth that helped us quite connect with singers famous and also work actively to promote the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We concluded that the work unseen, is as if not.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks aid the European Union, we afford to furthermore teachers quality, equipment, etc</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Do you had intention of go as far with The TAP TAP?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the principle saw the potential, can be something otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="68">The showbiz is full things are each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">Is logical, its way, everything new welcomes caution and time-consuming in acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="70">Little extraordinary things, but I daresay The TAP TAP is one.</seg>
<seg id="71">The impression someone to see us first is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...</seg>
<seg id="72">But compassion is completely superfluous because the disabled are not abandoned beings suffer and should have compassion.</seg>
<seg id="73">People is capable of a full life and develop, provided by course, for the means.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say if something I goes well to disabled, then, is not only progress for them, but to all society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Is Ayudó the fact which is you a leader demanding, as I describes many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If do a work of quality, we must be rigorous many aspects and demanding discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">Think it perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with the forefront clouds and when acquiesce must go two days test go to proof preparatory and long travelling and concerts the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">But this is how works everywhere, each group wants work and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently the group The TAP TAP 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many were already in the beginnings of 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are a group opened, people enters and leaves, cannot avoid.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has will and want find open-door always the</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Will the day before the expected end of the world, the Thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 p.m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Will take place the Incheba Arena of Prague, Fléda of Brno and 12 in Ostrava and participate Plynojem and others musicians groups Czech</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">The three cities connect the veiled through videoconference to sing together song the group The TAP TAP 'End of world cancelled'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The objective of concert is gather necessary resources to finance equipment multifunctional of central barrier-free education STUDEO on Jedličkův ústav of Prague, which cost rises 25 million CZK.</seg>

<seg id="6">I remember, for example, the conference A. Šternfeld the Observatory Warsaw astronomic, the 6 December 1933, presented its ideas on the study pioneer 'Introduction to cosmonautics'.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ideas of young engineer (born the 1905) left assistants indifferent and, after years, Šternfeld recalled Dr Jan Gadomski was the only had shown interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">The year 1934 Šternfeld achieved France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for their 'Introduction to cosmonautics'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier became later a great promoter of Astronomy and cosmonautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Published hundreds articles magazines Polish and wrote a number books devoted to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known worldwide and contribution science was rewarded when was behalf one of the cráteres of the hidden side the moon.</seg>

<seg id="12">Already year 1925 built on Poland a dresina was to be employer-based of an engine rockets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, is unknown who was the author of the proposal and not the project destalles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is not clear if rocket was to be used for grubbing the dresina or for braking.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information on this dresina merely collection on the press the time.</seg>

<seg id="19">However, with the arrival of German troops, was research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The year 1937 the press specialised the prototype a missile hunting photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza', of author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were military use engines for missiles.</seg>
<seg id="22">Little earlier war, the Committee adviser provisional scientific (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) responsible for all technical projects rockets to military use and all the work coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Committee was founded on 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted for starting war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Others studies devoted to cosmonautics were on the Polish press after the war thanks to the work Society Polish of astronáutica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">The November 1954 of the magazine Problemy refers first society with four articles very extensive efforts astronáutica.</seg>
<seg id="26">One of them, of Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society devoted to cosmonautics.</seg>

<seg id="30">Played office until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956, the PTAs involved significantly on the development of rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), a success and became the first Polish rocket which carried out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was concluded 1957 and launched first 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket had a heyday of 1,800 metres, around 80 cm and not reached the 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, was build RM-1A version and summer of 1959 the proof airlines RM-2 rockets two-stage desert of Błędów.</seg>

<seg id="36">Other developing rocket would be studied real scientific. Rocket RM-34 was to play a heyday of 14.5 km and its mission would control wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, 1962 suspended the work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor early rockets such RM was the rocket Meteor-1, built during the years 1962 and 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">Was designed as rocket two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and a burden initial 32.5 kg</seg>
<seg id="40">Developed three types (so-called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed each other for the space available for appliances scientists.</seg>

<seg id="1">The suspension law on social work is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The week the judged constitutional suspended the traabajos social law.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution awakened a heated discussion in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Will certainly be interesting examining the problem existed since a broader view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Economic systems liberal EU, like the globalised world, on the principle of greater economic competition and less legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Consequently, this means the different ways systems economic and national economic conflict permanent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause is the free trade principle and of free movement private capital unlimited, together with financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The effect of large disparities in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation the manufacturer, with the goods imported cheap to gap and for this' causes a bajadda 'the price of competitor with the aim of be with most of the market and thus increase profit margin.</seg>
<seg id="10">Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, delocalise production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where the price of work compared with other economies, is higher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital is not social responsibility and, with this, is not responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows State necessarily social spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">All this conducive the full disinterest of entrepreneurs for pay taxes and damage social and economic caused to profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is universally so known that is not necessary statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Practices little handle of private capital create situations, certain economies, when governments of these countries forced to compete with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of the own population and thus attracting capital abroad the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Said otherwise, governments are private capital available to its own population disregarding the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is patent on all on changes laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to force people to accept dictated of private capital, especially as to wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This takes place, partly through the system obligation economic case long term unemployment; using the right restricted employees rights work.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a increasing poverty alongside the increasing differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">For a number of years, are Germany delivery points of food for poor people cannot be with their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people receiving such assistance arrives already million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Under the increase competitiveness German economy produces a case quite: people employed with a salary so under the state must pay rest to minimum necessary for survive.</seg>
<seg id="23">Was public a scandal of this kind on the situation of employees ancillary of Parliament German.</seg>
<seg id="24">Savings measures practically all States southern EU lead undoubtedly the same situation. Persons pressured by decline social status abysmal, forced to emigrate and the nineteenth or malvivir paid in the limit rotten society, hoping someday private capital investor reaches the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Need preguntrarse where is?</seg>
<seg id="26">The case of other EU countries, then poverty happens of a country to another or is never Chinese, since, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or African still work by a tiny part of a European salary.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also affects all Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Theories Liberals and the media claim nauseam the state ought not capital bring the economy, to economy leads to its failure.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital defends tooth-and-nail the thesis the state ought not intervene on the economy meddled on control.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then is necessary wonder if private capital influences with its selfishness on the march policy and therefore around the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here the answer is clearly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Proof is the existence of lobbies, practice very powerful and omnipresent, all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a straits to provide corruption, mutual the favors, of legislation is practically reprehensible everywhere but not is punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">Germany the situation is: state ministries, lack of financial resources, responsible wording projects bill legal private companies, which are often linked with industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Such projects laws are adopted after the Bundestag, Parliament German.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of this way, all power not from the people, as announces constitutions of democracies Western, but the strong financial groups representing their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Is obvious democracies with a liberal-minded are rapidly describing situation how Appiános to his work The crisis Roman Republic times Caesar and Pompeii: 'the State wore time disintegrating and administrations thinks force'.</seg>
<seg id="38">To change bribes, favors achieved illegitimately and help finance stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people going into the polls with the vote apalabrado of advance... had not people with nature aspirara to an administration once because of this disorganisation, the been spent eight months without consuls... began be seriously the sole remedy for a very serious situation was autocracy and need choose a man energetic '... Although Appiános thought in Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy for always autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion, in antiquity, is society in today inconsiderate preferences the individual benefits without taking account of common interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital is not able, essence understand and claim the benefits all society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is the same that the then, a decadence of unprecedented elite, without a effort to deeply reforming it.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causes booming fascist and communist regimes must sought therefore unbridled liberalisation systems economic twentieth the nineteenth and.</seg>
<seg id="44">With respect to the current situation, is possible consider disappearance of these systems benefit of a democracy, as a pause defined, waiting next blow.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact really damning is the elite current ignores losses hundreds of thousands in lives, disasters social and humanitarian of the we witnessed and crimes against humanity, as the know the history and the latest.</seg>
<seg id="46">The suspension of the law on public is not the solution contracts; at least not long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure of economic competition, both internationally as within the EU, the government Czech Republic obliged to follow seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">Is the solution reforms specific socio-political, capital reinforce both the participation influence the state as the government citizens and undermine the monopoly position of private capital in society benefit of state.</seg>

<seg id="17">The details on the operation remained secret long, the film has made to memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film of Affleck is a mix singular of several genders.</seg>
<seg id="19">A political realistic; thriller, a so-called caper movie ', history a episode which went well (an example deception can be the number Ocean's Eleven).</seg>
<seg id="20">The film combine the moods. Are a Tehran well-documented sequences. The sequence of appropriations are photographs flagship times events, which were embodied similarly the film; no many differences here.</seg>

<p>

<seg id="25">ARGO is its third largometraje, after 'farewell small, farewell' 2007 and the thriller 'The Town. City thieves' (2010).</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is the disorder arises of the need show too too action places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very facetious as contributors role Hollywood, although his characters deserved more area and not are, alone in this film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For these reasons, the film of Affleck loses a little layout dramatic, but is a Amelio to can continue moderate interest, value fulfilment and the style retro a thriller it evokes the 1970.</seg>

<seg id="1">The study MVRDV architecture the real adventures not only the forefront - the example library of Spijkenisse and the newly completed 'mountain of books' - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">'I think the building is fun, looks futuristic and, finally, something interesting to do', States Lisette Verhaig, a transeúnte through the street.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, technical IT a large company located close library, points: 'furthermore, the building is beautiful'.</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why we need a library today.</seg>
<seg id="5">All Internet, tablets and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">It by happy to those libraries passé?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a city bedroom situated the doors of Rotterdam scarcely deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honour having taken a record for forget.</seg>
<seg id="8">The population 80,000 inhabitants presents the rate of literacy lowest of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">For counteracting this shameful, some years decided contribute somehow general culture and copying the represented fake appear seven bridges on euro notes part armed concrete miniaturas decoradas.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the education offensive was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">And was as policy-makers decided only was a opportunity to improve statistics: had to build a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, study MVRDV Dutch architecture, all a master the art of the diagrams and responsible rods buildings fun while cynics, took the issue with its usual serenity and appeared the presentation the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and smiles.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury looked perplexed around and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to piling books size forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the following words: 'Dear,</seg>
<seg id="14">Here the you, my proposal to the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years after, the mountain of billion closed 30 the runway.</seg>
<seg id="16">This part revitalisation, project supplementing with a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and asset-backed.</seg>
<seg id="17">To early November the mountain of books was awarded second prize 'Best Library of NL 2012'.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furthermore, the draft is also nominated the 'Dutch National Wood Award 2012'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Of this way, small city history lacking hitherto not had nothing more to offer pedestrian a zone post-modern and a local government incredibly ugly following whose façade blanche one intuiría rather a central dairy now has a work contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long way to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression is is a paradise books under quesera.</seg>
<seg id="23">Well there is lift we transported fair the heart of this mountainous massif, but the real football-loving the reading space and not use it, but prefer merged with its topography each step escalation to the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">The internal completely acristalado is bright and easy of cover with view, the ground brick recocido and the glamour street lamps support unequivocally the public condition library.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">The look can reach visualise the park, dogs and children play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books and more books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">'Normally the bookshelf are ready throughout the façade and the focus opens a huge room obscure generally usually something uncomfortable and impersonal', States Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">What us is put upside down classical configuration space and draw the area of reading Interior abroad.</seg>
<seg id="30">The mountain is well taken: the are offices, the Internet library, the club chess, the Education Centre environmental and room maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Deserve special mention black bear shelves the role padding mural, parapet and barandilla the same time.</seg>
<seg id="32">View, the tact and the nostrils are strangers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and civil engineers more the day shackle the forefront when hear speak of this material unknown.</seg>
<seg id="34">'We wanted work with materials recycled', explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="35">And is as a day on a farm Friesland, we have the by-product appropriate from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, the greenhouses and the fields of the Netherlands uses fabric plastic scarce millimetres thick as basis to restrain the root crops.</seg>
<seg id="37">Is a materials cheap and efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">This fabric hard fine two stations and after dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="39">To the library this fabric prensó, first such quantities, to achieve planks four centimeters thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour and becomes a materials obscure, homogeneous and resilient than smells a mix car new and zapatilla of sport.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Following 105 rungs is the mountaintop.</seg>
<seg id="42">This route continuous almost half metres around the mountain awaits us the reward: from cafeteria not only has fantastic view of the city, but it can also be enjoy the flavoursome Dutch croquetas and their ficus planted huge pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">These create an environment Nice the couple maintained humidity air adequate to this mountain of literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations to a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">'Although perish the thought given their hypermarkets acristaladas, this building is a project exemplary regarding ecology', indicates Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heating and cooling necessary gained from geothermal.</seg>
<seg id="47">Despite the mountain of books is located under enormous glass pyramid, even the days more sunny the sun only shines during few p.m. inside.</seg>
<seg id="48">The huge cerchas timber on sense cross-cutting the glass serve to give shadow and absorb the majority rays the sun.</seg>
<seg id="49">This creates a internal climate comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest is thing of the shutters automatic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker sector IT, already has dared to put on the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Equally, the professor of medicine traditional Chinese Cynthia Bogarde visited the library. It qualifies the 'Boekenberg' and the 'late soul' of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason is, the opening that took place a couple of weeks, invited all city residents to donate a book their private collection.</seg>
<seg id="55">This to fill, the gaps optical of a library yet with its full archive; currently has 70,000 exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has significance deep.</seg>
<seg id="57">Are full shelves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">'not is nothing worse than a library half-empty', says the architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">'I believe thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a link with this building.</seg>
<seg id="60">All know their book forms part library.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although only there for embellish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: 'The Germans must play a role stronger'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, US expert relations UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin diplomatic position rather sharper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: early weekend, Germany hinted which vote against the proposal to give territories Palestinians State status UN observer.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, finally Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany non-support what Israelis have fact Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, to the special relationship unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the same time nor supports the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted demonstrate independence without be too critical with Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising Libya on March 2011, Germany abstained when it was was of establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has finally been declared NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is Le is difficult Germany posturing clear when are at stake important international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other, is.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is because currently re-allocating its foreign policy, alienating a policy led,, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">And what further hinders things is Europeans have consistent policy and uniform.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, Germans are at a crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of them expects play Role more independent, but are unaccustomed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Believe still probing what its role, but have already started way towards a policy external normal '.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy similar to the countries as France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What means foreign policy 'normal' from terms German?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Is a policy when is national interests, persuades to defend different positions to the United States or its European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">Believe German foreign policy is a powerful motivation economic policy, is say, exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic interests Germans are to some point different from other major powers and therefore Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Are these economic interests have influenced the position taken regarding the conflict Middle-East and the vote of the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By a hand, Germany has large markets Middle-East, especially Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">For this reason careful and not must be into of Arab public opinion nor elites Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is important, of course.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would such importance which is not a relationship perfectly unilateral.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, yes play a key role in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Has Germany undermined its relation to US the abstain on important decisions and vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Believe Europe and even US German, the position enjoys a huge degree understanding.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore think has occurred drastic a break as Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps with this Germany has achieved curry a respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all, all this has only demonstrate a country which take seriously as international player and whose interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Europe is different views Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, US has clearly shown for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is there disparity of views between US and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Have always existed these disparities due to internal policy American.</seg>
<seg id="40">Believe government Obama shows secret a great understanding towards the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But, because of the situation policy live here clearly cannot defend government in public this position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think the genuine disparity of opinions has no the importance attributed to it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Looking at relations between Obama and Israeli Premier Netanyahu, Obama is to nothing enthusiastic with the policy develops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is Le is difficult Germany reconcile the close relations with Israel and United States, for a hand, with the position of its main partners at the EU, for another?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Think this making difficult for Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course be a little easier for Germans if a European policy consistent and homogenous, but is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, not have the possibility part of higher BLS, but must boost things from its own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">This is precisely what are doing now with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe the future Germany assume a leading role forcing Europe to adopt a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course this is nothing easy for Germany, whether simply by the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a tough subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">But the Germans have clear must play the role of contained independent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Is Germany itself into the role of important international player? does actually Germany assume a role protagonist?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or perhaps I remains proving difficult accept leadership?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not yet accustomed, is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country remains costing play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If see the euro crisis, for example, each time positions itself as Germany mega-player, unlash certain feelings antialemanes.</seg>
<seg id="57">This is not easy for Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">Is a old problem nobody wants be surrounded the countries enemies.</seg>
<seg id="59">Seen this way, Germany uniquely much more difficult United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">Must show receptive the different views neighbours and and this not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of US in European policy diminishes increasingly, but the EU not moment covers this vacuum, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="62">Germans not left to take a role stronger.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if dislike, if it is unpleasant or if makes them a people even more unpopular, c'est the vie!</seg>

<seg id="15">More 40% of the population is already positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Partnership voices for Africa has encountered Germany godparents for the 180 orphans AIDS people of Esitjeni.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the main sexually-transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">Between the ETS of origin bacterial are the syphilis, chlamydia and the gonorrea.</seg>
<seg id="37">The ETS of origin virus more usual are AIDS, the virus papilloma, the genital herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The ladillas and the Sarna are between the ETS water-borne parasites.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">The syphilis and the gonorrea occur more frequently men have sex with others men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute Robert Koch part that at least four five cases of syphilis registered Germany originate contact between men. Sexual</seg>
<seg id="42">For adults heterosexual sexually-transmitted diseases more usual are infections chlamydia, tricomonas, the virus papilloma, the candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrea.</seg>
<seg id="43">Contagion HIV among adults heterosexual the country is relatively low; however, around 20% of new HIV infections on this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Between the young, infections chlamydia are much more usual other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">European surveys, three quarters of all infections young affect 15-25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Our country virus papilloma also adds to diseases more between the youth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How evolved number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually-transmitted diseases are subject to declaration compulsory.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Institute Robert Koch, the number of infections syphilis doubled their figure of 2001 3.698 to 1.697 cases where 2011.</seg>

<seg id="55">Often not cause pain or cause others symptoms and therefore not detected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce contagion risk, but not provide protection the.</seg>
<seg id="58">Some pathogens of sexually-transmitted diseases also can be transmitted through infections dirt and contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">For this reason, experts recommend be regularly examinations doctors, especially if changes frequently of partnership sexual.</seg>
<seg id="60">If early diagnosed of way, most the ETS can healed and is late avoid any result possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through cooperation donations and, last but not least, fees of the chorus for their action throughout Germany, reach collect rather money.</seg>
<seg id="62">'total have sent already 200,000 EUR Esitjeni', indicates proud Annette Lennartz, chairperson of the association.</seg>

<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">'AIDS is taboo all', States Annette Lennartz, 'because concerns sexuality'.</seg>
<seg id="72">Something strange a country where King has officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.</seg>

<seg id="78">Is another culture, here only accept contact skin against skin '.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="82">Despite this small population barely appear maps, River Valley is very known Ezulweni.</seg>
<seg id="83">'Acércate to Esitjeni, there shines the light', the people.</seg>

<seg id="11">However, we are the most southern Azerbaijan; here the border with Iran is only a kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here live 'talyshi', a people of not know much, dominate perfectly Persian and the Azeri and are very ageing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Our destination is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">This small city boasts a architecture perhaps too maciza designed the Soviet-era and is fit within a landscape mountainous so scenic.</seg>
<seg id="15">European tourists are hardly this, since the way from the capital Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.</seg>
<seg id="16">To go the 323 km separating both cities, need eight-hour because road is.</seg>
<seg id="17">The staggering wealth enjoys the country through oil Caspian has not yet reached this recóndita region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has be to become a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Baku became famous in May with the conclusion Festival Eurovision and next year hold Festival of people more elderly world' Fatulayeva, points.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">A son own died to the age of 136 years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the star indisputable of museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, no starting birth what certify.</seg>
<seg id="26">And considering the man greater age documented lived 122 years, the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="27">'born in the region 1805 when and died in 1973', explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time devise a daughter more to the age of 136 years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Has wrong then Şirali Müslümov its age a couple decades?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo on the Institute Max Planck Society Rostock, has also heard of the elderly this inhabitant Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">'In some regions China, Japan Valley or Hunza Pakistan also live elderly very advanced', States Scholz, 'even Sardinia many older men'.</seg>
<seg id="32">Because lack of documentation, is impossible provide scientific evidence on age, especially when there no civil register.</seg>

<seg id="35">Today 20 people over the 100.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why live here, South, many elderly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The tour guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains is the special genes of the talyshis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes in change that the cause is food.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, from a seem logical nutritionally, not precisely food rich calories of the talyshi, which love meat, bread and mainly dairy and many of the which, furthermore, drink daily a glass butter derretida, so healthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or perhaps the way of natural life which keeps the young people? on Cengemiran, a small settlement not far city Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">Their 97 years is relatively young to what is estila for these latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, which states have 143 descendants, lives in a simple home timber typical all the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sitting on soil, moves tirelessly a huge VAT of butter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live under a ceiling, between them one of children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also brincan around two toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen preparing tea guests, tea which serve in few glasses typical with way abombada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and perfectly aligned and under the headscarf hides two long trenzas of hair dark their child we discovers proud.</seg>
<seg id="48">Always I laundering the hair never milk therefore I has fallen and has maintained colour.</seg>

<seg id="55">Yet again track when the 'dear father', Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Such propaganda sounds rare from a woman greater.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, Azerbaijan the cult to professes the contained paternal of the nation, which is country as a dictator, not bounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">This remained power until 2003, when surrendered the baton to his son Ilham.</seg>
<seg id="59">At least the elderly of Azerbaijan not know what is poverty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva is 230 manat (roughly the same amount) of monthly pension, to live well given the situation here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And perhaps the canoso son of Mirzayeva is right: 'Our culture the greater well-respected'.</seg>

<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to criticise the were; says recall Mexicans of those times difficult</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette said the mexicano-estadounidenses trapped between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely was down by the Dome and reached the area of discussion immigration and was already totally unclear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A indicated posters towards two queues: a to 'Mexican' and another to 'Foreign'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I was there seconds without be sure where should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having grown Central California, all my life I drew Mexican ''.</seg>
<seg id="9">Is taquigrafía ethnic, similarly my friends Boston relate to themselves as' Irish 'or my friends New York define themselves' Italian.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided to 'mexicano-estadounidense'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, homeland of my grandfather, the taquigrafía or the hyphens were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Was simply American.</seg>
<seg id="14">Speaking Spaniard. Sufficiently well to manejarme during a interview this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But have not the level of vocabulary a and cannot native because of my accent American.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So took my US passport and I made the queue of foreigners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Thought in this week where President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">The agenda, as always meeting leaders consisted these two countries,: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Peña Nieto was forward speak also the growth of the economy Mexican, a of the reasons why currently Mexican a is so likely to is Mexico as venture to go to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">To partnership with United States and Canada and creating in America a trade bloc the EU style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Furthermore, Peña Nieto promised continue fighting cartels drugs Mexico, although not gave details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relation to the United States is complicated and grudge.</seg>
<seg id="23">US probably most remember never in 1848 the US invaded Mexico and forced its leaders cede half of its territory gunpoint.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who think centuries, not Minutes, the elements remembers are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So, when the a United States official say anything involving the slightest criticism Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both the press as between the Mexican elite, on how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="26">And children of Moctezuma rose of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, for Mexico the relationship really is a challenge is the with the more 35 million mexicano-estadounidenses living the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Are of rancor?</seg>
<seg id="29">Much.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico winners and losers, persons to the country provides opportunities and other for which is not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason we people living cities Mexican descent as LA, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is, somewhere our family tree, person, the parent or any of grandparents was closed door opportunity Mexico and had to leave northwards.</seg>
<seg id="32">And most the times anyone fit into a profile certain: dark-skinned, a level of studies low, from a people poor etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their top-down and I loyal.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mexico not.</seg>
<seg id="35">And, despite perhaps we experiencing now the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good work, cannot lose never that what are experiencing is, the American dream, and not Mexican the.</seg>
<seg id="36">Is possible sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty it is.</seg>
<seg id="37">Is for the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Moreover, aware many of Mexicans belonging the elite class leader gustamos not.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">See us as a reminder a humiliating defeat and we look above shoulder as if we a inferior not sufficiently Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong.</seg>
<seg id="42">To their view, our existence is failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed Mexico, not gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And now we would not trapped after this smokescreen gloves, living well to the United States but, still, as souls solitary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My woman, born in Guadalajara and wine legally the United States when was a girl, I recalls is this friction between the Mexicans and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more solidity who are and the seconds this resent.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although citizen of the United States, it feels part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Meanwhile, many mexicano-estadounidenses I know feel not part of none of the two.</seg>
<seg id="48">Love Mexican The hear the group Northern Tigers, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Have the best of each country, but you are not rooted to them.</seg>
<seg id="50">Mexico see us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the United States we believes Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, to complicate things, for what I learned during my trip some leaders Mexicans and intellectuals want reconnect to the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">Want the mexicano-estadounidenses work as' ambassadors' of Mexico makeshift, representing their interests the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We say to our colleagues US fantastic which is visit this country and presionaríamos leaders politicians to strengthened ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, clear...</seg>
<seg id="56">This will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Is too rancor.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, with inequality wages, corruption rampant and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure fantastic is a country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear you you will be alone with this idea friends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States way treated a century ago and environment Mexico, then must accept the fact some mexicano-estadounidenses are still resented how treated less relatives long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps be more 'Mexicans' what thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a basis unlikely for peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can have someday lasting peace between Arabs and Jews Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another bloodshed which seem to any hope is vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Amid the pointless and usual discussions on who began first, piles buildings left in rubble; 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis murdered and, first, missiles from Gaza have fallen close Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But, despite Israelis and Palestinians appear anchored to their former conflict, all to Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Spring has left Arab all shattered like or not, Palestinians and Israelis stranded the regional fuss.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this make your fight even more bloody than before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, its lethal impasse could desencallarse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war which or loses or wins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To first view, optimism currently looks very difficult to justify.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if maintained ceasefire agreed 21 November, clashes this week have strengthened hawks sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Leaders Hamas, the Islamist movement which has governed Gaza since 2007, will say have obliged Israelis to withdraw despite Gaza has received a good whacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite having killed some of its leaders got pressure and the 1.7 million Gazans one corners grimmest and villages of planet, Israel has not solve Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of fact, Hamas is gaining ground West Bank, the other part Palestine currently governed by its hard-hitting rival Fatah, the Palestinian faction more moderate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Furthermore, leaders Hamas may conclude time plays its favour.</seg>
<seg id="17">Given Islamists have gone gaining influence for all the Arab world, Hamas has fact rich friendships and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a resurgent regional power which previously the Muslim ally closest to Israel, has embraced the cause Hamas. Also Qatar, States more rich Gulf and dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Member exhilarating Hamas say the Islamist Crescent collects Israel, from Lebanon north, where dominates the partido-milicia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels a trend increasingly Islamist could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where allies Hamas are threatening the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Especially the South Israel, growth of the Brothers military-led Muslim the President Muhammad Morsi Egypt, with difference the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, despot secular government Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, not had too time to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, the Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and their more leaders popular opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">On future action diplomatic, Hamas emerges as protagonist the cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the hard wing Israel will conclusion opposite.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the military question, have put Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="26">The anti-missile system Iron leadership of Israel has proved effective and many missile Hamas have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israelis dormirán more confident... for some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">Regarding diplomacy, United States is firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas of initiating the last wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Above all, Israel prospered. Especially under the government Benjamin Netanyahu, a first minister has ignored widely the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed a 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier dissolves West Bank, the main hunk of a territory would-be become state Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements which are increasing even though, under international law, are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined a group line even more hard Iranian-led Avigdor Lieberman the run-up to elections the 22 January, is good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why coddling these clever Palestinians giving them own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If really ruled by, not dispararían rockets as have compatriots Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">Is better taken after this wall and to a good blow if rose head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps prevail hard wing, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although Islamists to take power and elsewhere Egypt not have much appreciate Israel, its priority will address the internal difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defence budget of Israel is greater than the its four Arab neighbours together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the superpower area hardly help new governments Arab improve their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire augurs well and could usher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also Israelis should think long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">With elsewhere Arab becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians its right to self-determination means creating a tinderbox a day will explode at Israeli-occupied territories, this week exploded a bus Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression is already undermining democracy on the state Jewish and demography worsens the situation as the population Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="43">The harsh missions on Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas pay diplomatic a toll growing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a nudge of outsiders the conflict.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The solution touting people remains sensible sides, most of the world foreign and this newspaper: two states and ceding territory Israel for safety reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hope, small short-term the ceasefire give a little more impetus outsiders struggling.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, must start stop arms entering Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on borders 1967, with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem shared.</seg>
<seg id="48">Arabs unrelated to the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.</seg>
<seg id="49">This more the creation of a state Palestinian the imminent seeking a category of State virtual the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr Obama is also a important role in regard to achieve Israel to the table.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first mandate omitted present its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">The White House, seems as reluctant to devote their attention.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">After examination investigations published and raise the idea before a group of discussion formed per 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of 'wish, but, participate in a activity you full'.</seg>

<seg id="22">Points which with apathy there is the wish do something.</seg>

<seg id="26">Sometimes think we bored, when what happens is actually we problems for concentrate.</seg>

<seg id="34">We all aburrirse sometime: late plane, a speaker monotonous, a film especially boring.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people have more tendency to aburrirse other.</seg>
<seg id="36">To help measure, some researchers extraneous the 1980s a 'scale of trend the boredom'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes issues such as' many of the things I have are repetitive and monotonous' and 'there is so much interest me not have time of do everything'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology University West Florida,, using those scales, researchers have found boys have more tendency to aburrirse more often than girls, and specifically need more stimulation external and more varied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But generally adolescents are a kind group weary rather easily.</seg>
<seg id="40">1991, Reed Larson, Development Professor human and Community University of Illinois, carried out a experiment which represented contact with 400 adolescents and his parents between seven and eight times daily through a seeks.</seg>
<seg id="41">Discovered the 32% of adolescents said to aburría while school or making duties, while 23% said to aburría when was not school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Furthermore, 3% of parents had they bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said not knew if percentages boredom current, 21 years after, would lower superiors or.</seg>
<seg id="44">But said what knew was' adolescence is a period where boredom reaches its higher inexpertly ', largely because both children as adolescents are not given a great control over what want do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, turning to my question of principle: is good aburrirse?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes it is not, since, led to extreme, could make we expose physical risks absurd, as do bets and fall consumption substances as method to combat it, as demonstrate investigations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Furthermore, many philosophers and writers speak the connection between the boredom and creativity, claims Professor Vodanovich, which has State studying this matter for more two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">'The boredom is the brain of say to should be doing else, "says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology of New York University.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain not always know what more appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you are boring and you this energy to touch the guitarra or cooking, this you will.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if are television, you satisfies short term, but long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">'So, if your son is boring and I a iPad, already aburra not, but no learned to dilly-dally itself or to dosificarse', States Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And 'this capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations',.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your son not only learns to dilly-dally alone, but learns to be better controlled elsewhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Not really want praise the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But should not be too critical with him.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our objective should be, rather the be comfortable paragraphs of persistent rumour activities and technologies.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">Knew the government to many things, as launch perfumes with feromonas or organise veiled quick citations (speed-dating).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas can have been creative, but not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we think, why not do the more creative effort to resolve this problem, which is compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Not taken so lightly is government Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Spent $1.3 the policies year to encourage citizens have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A government package to marriages and parents attaches until $15,000 per child, extends maternity and distributes tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city high-tech rich and State south-eastern Asia, also known for conservatism their leaders and their stringent controls social.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth-rate of Singapore, agree with its division national population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last was above 2 - known as rate of reposición- was 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why the singapurenses not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">So Wei Ming, director Policy marriage and Family of Division National Population, says is' better education 'and' a wider range of career opportunities'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">'That has given the people have a wider range of options in terms objectives of life and priorities, beyond marry and a family', explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social standards contributed to increasing soltería, and delay marriage and births, resulting fall birth rate Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, a immigration policy should tip to increase drastically immigration to confront the population decline has created resentment between the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">Singapore is websites where abounds xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, criticising for maintaining low wages and not integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Increasing immigration is also seen as a reason why the last year the party Singapore government experienced its worst result election since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections an attempt of correct the problem quotas and higher charges for workers foreigners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Consequences unexpected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax income healthcare costs and policies immigration, the example Singapore is also having some consequences unexpected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government tries to not build houses small. Many</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These flats have areas of 46 square metres and have had great success sales.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern of could promote a lifestyle of soltería and discourage developers to build family large houses,.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon CEO the company property EL Developers, says their boxes of shoes' sold much faster units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Are more popular, sense units is deplete days, even weeks, faster units greater size.</seg>
<seg id="40">This makes it much better for our flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, admits the new rules clearer guidelines for give developers, previously they put obstacles if wanted offer too small units a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too stressed-out</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>

<seg id="44">While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the birth-rate national speak with the singapurenses working on the financial district appear centre not will have much effect.</seg>
