<h1>
<seg id="1">A republican strategy to hinder the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The republican justified his policy by the need to fight against the electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, the Brennan Center considers this to last a myth and claims that the electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die because of a lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, the lawyers republicans have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively on the rate of participation.</seg>
<seg id="6">In that sense, these measures will undermine part of the american democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Contrary to what happens in Canada, the american states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in this same line of a majority of the american governments enacted, starting from 2009, new laws that hindered the process of registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has been extended after the elections in November 2010, which saw the rise of 675 new representatives republicans in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Accordingly, during the year 2011 were introduced 180 projects of law restricting the exercise of the right of vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, along with proof of american citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, these laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the election day and removed their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, no american state demanded that the voters to present an identity document with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="14">The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore, the republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In recent years, these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states to force the voters to submit an identity document with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the american citizens do not have an identity document universal, such as the Social Security card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of the american citizens, that is to say, 21 million people in age to vote, do not have any identity document with a photograph issued by a government agency in your state.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack of an identity document with these features.</seg>
<seg id="21">But, often, the obtaining of identity document required costs more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low income.</seg>
<seg id="23">In effect, a 25% african-american, 15% of people earning less than $ 35,000 a year, 18% of the citizens over 65 years of age, and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have an identity document with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And there's even more.</seg>
<seg id="25">In many states, the students, the voters more vote for the democratic candidates, they can not use the identity card with photograph issued by your institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, those same states allow the members of the clubs of fishing or hunting that tend to vote for the republicans to use the documents issued by such clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona became the first state to introduce such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to show that they are american citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are looking for, clearly, to limit the hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems that two of every three hispanic voters support the democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of voting in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who would like to sign up.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, in the 2004 general elections, the campaigns of registration of the voters contributed to the record of around 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken since 2009 managed to which the rate of registration of new voters were to fall in 2010 in comparison with the year 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, republican lawmakers have adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the period of voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were african-american, while the latter does not amount to more than 13% of the voters of the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the case of hispanics was exactly the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">These do not represent more than 11% of the voters, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">However, the whites, representing a 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have objected strongly to the adoption of laws that restrict the register of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">In this sense, the governors, democrats have blocked a number of bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Prosecutor's office of the United States intervened to suspend the laws most controversial.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics democrats denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are an attempt to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the scale of electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively on the rate of participation.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, the measures will undermine part of the american democratic system.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Detection of prostate cancer: how to Take the test or not to give it to them?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In effect, the test of PSA presents, sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform medical interventions useless.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a reason more than enough to make you doubt the men, already reluctant itself, on whether it should be done or not detection tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">How to take the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked council to two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies conducted in the United States detected a high rate of infection among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret the data and to make firm recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">For its part, the european study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been made in the detection and those who do not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, was also shown that there is between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if you have not done the screening test.</seg>
<seg id="9">I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or after the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men of african-american origin have an index of highest risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. You will need to provide all the possible options and do not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten the life in the long term, in which case you should opt for an active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today many men who have been detected cancer are not treated, since the cancer is not aggressive, or poses a risk to his life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if this progresses, we offer a treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We determine increasingly precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I recommend that you do the test in any case.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine if you should take the test or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the test the PSA.</seg>
<seg id="20">You can download this document (for the moment only in English, but will be offered translations within bit) at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is not a miraculous recipe for preventing cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits are still the best way to reduce the risk of developing the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We estimate that if all the world to eat well and to move enough, it could prevent a 30% of the cancers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one smoke, that rate would rise to at least 50%", stresses Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Society against Cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many others remain totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The tobacco is linked with the 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It hurts greatly to the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">A figure of hope: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The fat and obesity favour the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and cervix.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout the life protects against breast cancer," they add.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The power</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The agency recommends, also, to limit the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In large amounts, they climb the risk of developing colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">The sausage products should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of the meat to his smoked, dried or salted can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Can damage the cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer", they explain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, by the time its investigations are not conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the SCC, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D in cancer has not been able to determine with clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talk about the concerns and a family history of each one with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Do the screening test does not cause cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a lot of commotion last summer, and with reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed, in effect, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.</seg>
<seg id="4">And what is more, it is the particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter, which has still not been observed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physical is not completely clear concerned Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a doubt that there is a new particle, and that seems a lot like the Higgs particle predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data revealed this week in a major congress of physical held in Kyoto seem to confirm that yes, it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, because the chances of making a mistake seem few. We will see what this is about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There are, in this great world, a law pervasive and inescapable that means that two things can't be found in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is No way of breaking this rule and do not try too much, because you will end up getting hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that also in it there is a law of these features: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; "a state" that consists, roughly speaking, some of its features.</seg>
<seg id="12">Physicists classify the particles in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermions, obey wisely at the beginning of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who has no respect for nothing, or at least not by this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the website the Particle Adventure Labs Berkeley, which, by the way, it is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the inns, of which we won't discuss here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons, would emphasize here, there are the bugs exotic that we could believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson extremely banal: the photon, or the "particle of light", which acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">In effect, when a particle with an electrical load accelerates or changes of address, "mess with" the electromagnetic field at that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is not anything other than a photon; that is to say, one of the bosons "carriers of force".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Field more stable</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, Higgs field, which needs to be "messy" for this boson appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it makes it necessary to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a pond ice cream in which only a coarse rock could slide along the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this, you will need a huge particle accelerator such as CERN, the large hadron collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference!) to achieve such levels of energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all the particles or all of the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, they do, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will not be maintained ever by himself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), you do not have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Now, what does "can provide" all of those investigations?, question Mrs Plamondon.</seg>
<seg id="29">For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, in addition, that the physical escrutinen the differences between the observations and predictions of MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">For their part, many wish fervently that they are, well, the less difference it could open a door to a "new physics" that cover certain holes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, it must be said, has still enormous gaps, as it does not propose any explanation on the severity (oops!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But we have not found such differences in the CERN up to the moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of such investigations in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that mistake to say that it will not have any.</seg>
<seg id="35">For you to see: at the beginning of the 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would result.</seg>
<seg id="36">Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, as already said, the physical Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell laboratories, where he invented the laser in 1960, and which produced the first laser continuous (the first was pressed) in 1962, at the beginning, the laser was rather considered to be a "laboratory apparatus".</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, applications can also come from all of the instrumentation that surrounds the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle drew up a gauge of light in 1969 in the course of its research in the field of optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">Despite the fact that it was not at all his original intention, this gauge is now "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel prize for physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC want to necessarily transform our lives, but you never know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In his Commission to Die in dignity, Quebec has recently been discussed in the delicate question of the end-of-life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The discussion should be resumed soon as you are preparing a project of law.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, within that domain essential, there is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has tried to see it up close.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. he lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer that was destroying had given him a respite of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I had been given five years of life, but I've already had so seven," he says, made a pass, lying in your bed in the middle of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which came the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, not so we can be prepared for this," he continues.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has caused havoc: a weakness huge that prevents him from going to the bathroom and even eat alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, you agree resigned that will help you to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brave, she even to smile, to speak with strangers they devote attention, will bring medicines and offer a bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is that I heal diarrhea, it is humiliating," she confesses.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team found a remedy to that bad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does pee standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the centre Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Go back to your childhood, for certain people, it is a humiliation unacceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression", notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, according to the opinion of the majority of the people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of this regression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">All the patients who come into the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Have a life prognosis maximum of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them because they don't offer the care "healing".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The biggest fear of the Sra. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned".</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has made him discover to their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have some good children," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I do not have more desire in this life," he says, before accepting that you place a mask to help her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">And expect, in the next few days, a last visit to his son who lives in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps to power.</seg>
<seg id="29">Are palliative care that will give them when you can not do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="30">To help that his death would be more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for each 11.700 citizens.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, because we know that all we end up dying a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dra. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether at the level of physical comfort, emotional, or spiritual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The dying are offered to rinse mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">Death is a part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday in the evening we serve you a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, your child will be finished the beer at the foot of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help both to the patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever be the same.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the side of a man 94-year-old who savor your last family gathering in the courtyard, well-placed among its pillows while all drink to your health, a young man of 36 years dies in a tragic way, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"From six months ago, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 years sick of cancer", is concerned the Dra. Christiane Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients who are admitted in the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes to your house and 47% of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">77% of canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to care, to relieve the suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.</seg>
<seg id="47">And various agencies, such as the centre Victor-Gadbois and the society of palliative care at home the Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is precisely such a large relative lack in the health care of Quebec, which makes many specialized doctors in palliative care may fear thee, to the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since the month of October, a manifesto signed by leaders of palliative care, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to the Dra. Christiane Martel, the health system in Quebec is not competent enough as to ensure that anyone has the right to palliative care quality before acceptance to proceed with euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Recently", he recounts, "I've seen a patient to spend 14 days in the Emergency room suffering great pain without you've done enough to alleviate it.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive the appropriate care".</seg>
<seg id="53">And in parallel, many oncologists dig in their heels with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">The hopes of survival of Helene Richard were already under minimum when he left a chemotherapy treatment exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="55">"When I told my oncologist who wanted to stop the treatment, she said to me that he was very sorry that I would like to stop fighting," he says.</seg>
<seg id="56">"However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There isn't care all-powerful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Dra. Martel believes that 90% of people who request to die thank their caregivers who do not have attended to in their claims once they have been relieved their pain thanks to a team of palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But I have to say that in palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in regard to the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care home Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to the treatment of pain in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep to the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scandals real estate of large amplitude in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, collectors of funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia have, day after day, what you know of a formidable "system", which form part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.</seg>
<seg id="3">An "industry" that went too expensive to the taxpayers quebecois, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is curious how the system is sprayed once we hunted the big media", jokes, Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former head of the Police of Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="5">He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to a thorough research on the embezzlement related to contracts of roads in Quebec, the liberal prime minister of that time, Jean Charest, had not consented to more than delay.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "report Duchesneau" established a direct link between the industry, the clandestine funding of the parties and the corruption among officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"From the beginning of the research in 2010, only the ministry of transport, it would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of their instincts to stay with a proportional part.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Commission Charbonneau "has already made it down to two mayors", he adds, while you wait to get to "demonstrate the stratagems existing behind the individuals".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A permanent unit anti-corruption, created in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Unit permanent anti-corruption, created in 2011, also applies with his team of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">This unit works in addition to the police of "the squad Marteau", that, from 2009, have made the "cartel of the sewer" Montreal moderate at the time of inflated contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">These last few weeks, the unit has proceeded to the registration number of the allegations of fraud and corruption charges against municipal and Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a city outskirts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The next of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, you just resign from his post of mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is suspected that has pocketed repeated bribes to public procurement contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has been formally indicted engineers of the road network of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Linen Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter has caused shock to explain to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">He himself paid for three years, 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of the mayor Gerald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">M. Zambito dished out money right and left during the year 2000, giving more than 88,000 canadian dollars (about 68.000 eur) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted, equally, have organized a collection of illegal funds to the ex-deputy prime minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The inflation of the cost of the contracts of sewage</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years, received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and kickbacks from companies in the construction sector for a total of 736.000 dollars, all in exchange for contracts of sewage whose costs inflated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in the concept of false extras.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having turned a blind eye deliberately budget parallel, and filled their coffers of dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to Montreal to a huge crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first policies elected from Montreal who sounded the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">As mayor of the district of Riviere-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, is opposed from 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired for $ 5 million and resold by 1.6 million to the developers in the real estate boom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of the money of the electoral campaigns was dirty money</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The research that will eventually be carried out, it ensures that pulls a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fishing are the guilty".</seg>
<seg id="30">And he adds that the process is painful, but positive."</seg>
<seg id="31">We are cleaning the wounds but would lack a research unit clean in Montreal and be very alert to the dubious practices are not repeated.</seg>
<seg id="32">How do the cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is restless, especially for the role of '"politicians elected to the current of the device".</seg>
<seg id="35">Estimated at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was allocated to the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, jokes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of the reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The quebec government proposes to limit to $ 100 donations to political parties, but this will not change the donation, according to him, "while not strictly limited to the expenses of election, there will be dirty money in politics."</seg>
<seg id="37">It recommends a comprehensive review of the system of awarding of public contracts and financing of the parties: "we must not fall more low; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story is tarnishing the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at himself in the mirror.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!!!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season has acquired a new entity with PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How would you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">It could be explained by a decision of individual consciousness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Have reached great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">I go from day to day at his side.</seg>
<seg id="7">Technical staff also brought me a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">And those elements push me on a daily basis to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a game, that it is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything goes very quickly in football.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not acaloro.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the beginning of my career in the centre of preforming INF Clairefontaine up to my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in leaps and bounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Going to get the benefit of the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">The recruited from this summer are used to play games very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know that every training is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">That makes a player as I have a desire to fight and give it your all.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is backed by attachments such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">What Ancelotti is the man that the team needed?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect to all of the technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, there is no one equal in the League 1 and is among the top european coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">Has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think I will take other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a conversation very comforting to him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had just come out of a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust you have in me also explains my good performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?</seg>
<seg id="30">In League 1, Lyon us has taken the position of leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our major objectives is the champions League: we have qualified for the knockout stage with style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the aim of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We're going to try to get as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we have much to say in front of a lot of very good teams in europe.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want to start to finish first in our league against Porto in order to receive the return of the final round.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">What the PSG can turn into a big european club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">You already have the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a big european club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to your ways and means so that that project is realized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not to win the cup in the League 1, as in the last season, what would be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we will invest all our efforts in take that title of champions.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we didn't get far.</seg>
<seg id="47">In may we took a disappointment, as we had with the optimum conditions for you to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had a season strong.</seg>
<seg id="49">We ended up with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points should have been champions...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, had a stint quite a lot better.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year I think it will be good.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think that we have the weapons to llevárnoslo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expect more of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal to expect too much from us, if we believe in what has been invested in the players that we have.</seg>
<seg id="56">What we have fully accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="57">After that earn 4-0 at home to Troyes, that are still reproach ourselves with things that is a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what most people will expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">Never will we be able to win 4-0 every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!!!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to launch a project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.</seg>
<seg id="64">Just look at Manchester City, after two seasons, has not managed to qualify for the final round, and they have also invested a great deal!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the sums invested, os we'd imagine with a 15-point lead in the day.</seg>
<seg id="66">That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, has been seen as "driven" by this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the League 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in may we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished leading the trophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia".</seg>
<seg id="72">That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and gets a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">It has come to prove that he is the star of the League 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">And has shown all the equipment has been that it is a great player, a star of the world.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group we respect the man and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">And he also respects to the men around her.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">That pushes to the other to increase their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows also that all we see progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the team of France?</seg>
<seg id="81">It has been a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I was very excited to participate in this Championship.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things out there and I came out strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today achievement play good matches in the selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus".</seg>
<seg id="87">We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and to this must be that today we have an exemplary behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What vision you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps to the front of the "bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">It is getting results.</seg>
<seg id="90">They are well-located in the qualifying group for the World.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires them to win.</seg>
<seg id="92">As was the case of Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't want to make comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc achieved its goal to qualify for the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps lead to the selection of Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">What the draw (1-1) on 16 October in Spain served to lay the foundation?</seg>
<seg id="97">That game gave us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each one fought by all.</seg>
<seg id="99">Prior to that shock in Spain, had not lived a game like this in my entire career.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the contrary, the monetary exchanges current, based on the central banks, the transactions identified and processing loads between the parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of monopolies, banking, leading to the financial crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to us dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol of positive change to the way BitTorrent, which allows the sharing of files equal to equal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Have been registered about 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers of the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">And close to a few thousand web sites accept free as gifts or as a form of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The price of bitcoin, after having reached the top 30 dollars (23 euros) in June of 2011, fell to $ 2 five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (the quotes are censan on the page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">There is nothing impressive, if we compare it with the global changes in real currency or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on the virtual coins issued in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">In it, he described the bitcoin as "the virtual currency with more success", "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional coins".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other systems with the types of virtual currencies as the "credits", used to advance in a video game and you can win playing or you can buy (and even on occasions redeem).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But in all sharing a central authority controls and about the changes.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the bitcoin, all the network nodes are both depositories of books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does that network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is done in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a system of encryption dual-key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes bitcoins stated in the book of accounts public, which spreads throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key milestone consists in writing that new transaction in that book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This happens for the resolution of a math challenge thrown to the computers and the winner, a kind of a central banker interim, you will have the privilege to add that line complementary.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase of pieces of file, that is to say, of transformation of a large file in a footprint numerical shorter and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers to "catch" the new transaction and added a number before "chop up" the set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number that offers a unique mark (more leading zeros).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once you find that number, the other nodes in the check easily that is the good thing.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, for committing a fraud, a user would like to pay two times with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept as valid as one of the two transactions; the other would be an orphan, as both have different tracks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 free.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of free circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are split up the cienmillonésimo, which leaves a wide margin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase of the computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network already has its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The web sites that offer services to Bitcoin have been attacked and have been stolen free on deposit.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The ruling used does not affect the same protocol", says Pierre Noizat, which has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency using the network Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also take into account the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this service is anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the money in cash has the same defect.</seg>
<seg id="38">The actors of weight as Wikipedia reject the payments of this type.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron, Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, they released the "sales giants".</seg>
<seg id="42">"Is changed to $ 30,000", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the free gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, author of a book teaching about that currency, believed enough in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or to a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transaction, as well come out cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The carrier, in addition, it manages your identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement in the trades, they don't have to install new terminal or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">They simply provide an address that a phone can "shoot and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement of review of the systems hierarchical systems more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take a long time for Bitcoin is imposed, but in 2013 could be a change," he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Moreover, in its report, the ECB plans to revalue the various risk, today considered high, in the event that this currency is to be successful.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A Constitution with forceps in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new double or nothing of the president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives provisionally full powers, he decided to play all.</seg>
<seg id="4">Caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote for your final text the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week, the head of State was given two months more to the Assembly to finish their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And almost two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, several times amended, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has not done more to increase the fracture in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For their opponents, the president perseveres in its "delirium " autocratic" and continues "betraying his word" and "trampling on the right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the part of its supporters, it ensures that it is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the next 15 days should be organized a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short time span that force the Brothers to give up his project to explain the text, article by article, to the egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way of retrieving a popular legitimacy and democratic while the debate rages across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the egyptians will vote in his favour, as he stated in an interview to the american weekly Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that this resource has been voted very fast, contains an ultimatum to the egyptian people: "or vote my text or keep the full powers"powers that supposedly will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, islamist in their great majority, approved the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the liberals did not attend the call.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they thought that they could not enforce their points of view.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of the human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, substitute member, in a hurry.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the muslim brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">As expected, the items voted on what they have been unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day is expressed, almost to the hour of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the watch of the Constituent assembly, was wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday afternoon I was still being voted on, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2 the object of all the looks, it is still finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source of law".</seg>
<seg id="25">The parties salafistas, for whom the establishment of islamic law is a fundamental claim, they hoped that he would replace "the principles" by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of your good will and respect for the other components of the egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">The liberal dubbed hypocrisy and consider that this is not more than a wile advertising.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University in an advisory role, in particular for those who have to confirm their compliance with the laws of the Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, is disturbing because "the people called to rule is not chosen and has no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here we see the premises of a theocracy".</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of the university would be far less restrained than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For now, there is an implication religious concrete.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, we are in the framework of the civil status.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the jurists who have been working in this text are not scholars but college students, some of them trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the constitutional transition egyptian.</seg>
<seg id="36">But acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about the article 220, because the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We refer in particular to the term iqh [islamic jurisprudence, editor's note].</seg>
<seg id="38">And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule over all of this."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received a lot of criticism, which refer to the extended powers conferred by the president of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The muslim Brothers alegarán that are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another flashpoint: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to desire of the military, the review of the Defense budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but to a national defense council.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is also not prohibit the trial of civilians in military courts, as asked for associations for the defence of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These also showed its concerns relating to the text, that considered freedom-killing.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Although the egyptian president was supposed to come out last night on tv, are planned demonstrations to this noon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The supporters of the head of State was demonstrated on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While representatives and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that would bring the law on the required exam, have already appeared in the country scammers who trade with certificates "false"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year, 13 million migrant workers are coming to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">In their majority are citizens of countries of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its only aim is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">From the 1 of December enters into force a law, according to which each immigrant labour will have to perform a test to check their knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this rule is applicable only for those who have the intention of working in the sector of provision of services, institutions of community services, domestic services and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, with the time, as they promise in the Federal Service of Immigration, the tests will be made mandatory for all immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it will not be enough to pay the examination of the language, if not also the history of Russian and the fundamentals of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The knowledge of the language is a must confirm even to receive and renewal of a work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Are the exception to the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Shall not be subject to this law to the people who managed to get their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Utility, doom and defense of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of testing centers will work sponsored by the Institute of Russian Language Pushkin, the University of the Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education in Russian.</seg>
<seg id="15">Immigrants may be submitted to the tests in all the cities, now in Russia are open to more than 160 centres of this kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, managed to many times to ask this question to the press: And what will bring this in reality?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes will bring the obligation of the knowledge of the language, both for the russians as to the migrants themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the first place, respond to the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labour".</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people speak today about the defense of the rights of migrant labour, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">The defense of their rights must be started before his departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of selection organized will allow solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be sentenced to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of help, I would get a "trip paid" to a creepy and close covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In their homeland, they will promise one thing, but you are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, do not pay them the wages promised", confirmed by the Head of the Directorate of immigration, labour migration Service of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Don't be angry, jefecito!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, in the meantime, many citizens of the republics of Central Asia who wish to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, uzbeks, tajiks who can afford to receive primary education normal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is because their families do not even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention already dress them, calzarlos and buy what is necessary for the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">When you reach adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"One feels humiliated and bottom".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, in regard to the law on language, the human rights point out an important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have that status, there will be neither examination and, consequently, no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or forbidden to strangers"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many visitors say that receive the official status in our country is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the legalization costs money: twelve thousand sixteen thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, a false registration can be done quickly and by only one thousand five hundred roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that generally carry false documents, we are not registered and are the cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We ask for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," he commented to the journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, don't be stingy, purchase a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it became clear that not only the registration documents of immigrants may be false.</seg>
<seg id="47">Multiple certificates "false" of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="48">The forged documents had been printed on printers color standard.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they came to the hands of new owners not as a gift: every immigrant, willing to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for by the document, seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure of examination, which will cost the immigrant worker to three thousand roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption for the "diplomas" can't buy, converge government officials and human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="52">So far, the authorities may promise to migrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basics of the language.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with the people.</seg>

<seg id="8">In the network has appeared an open letter, whose authors, representatives of different social organizations of shooters, require that you desist from such measures of "strictness without sense".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percentage of acts of hooliganism with use of registered weapons is minimal, commented to the service of BBC news of Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of the year 2012 is committed 142 crimes with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, in front of the total 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are confident that a more stringent legislation in the sector of guns for civilian use shall not be a drawback for the offender to go to the black market.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, in the Ministry of the Interior stated that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Vendors: from factories to official</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The black market of weapons supplies through various channels.</seg>
<seg id="16">The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who for ten years he worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High State Higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screen shot of the web site that accepts orders of weapons</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first, "vestige of the army or military", that is to say, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The weapons were hurtadas by the Russian officials and by the same caucasians", says Baranets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The next type of "weapon black",stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranets explains that here include the weapons hurtadas of the stores of the police and those stolen directly by officials of the organs of law enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The illegal weapons they go on sale from the arsenals of the military.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many arsenals military often there were explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There are versions demonstrated that some of the fires were started deliberately to cover the missing", says one an ex military man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also put their grain of sand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Now has been a proliferation of private factories of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the rope to the black market, including that of Moscow", says the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">One more source of the black market is the smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Large quantity of guns and machine guns come from poor countries as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There have its own production, sometimes craft, and has formed a mob that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where are the weapons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts have calculated what is the participation of approximately each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for problem analysis and planning of the public management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminological literature and data of public access portals whose theme revolves around the arms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of the illegal weapons, according to the researchers, from the armed forces and the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of the arms black market has reached there, "the fault of officials whose work is related to arms", is said in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, the 17% of the guns come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of the cases is stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the "archaeology illegal".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The clerk at one of the stores of weapons, who asked that her last name not be mentioned, said that the weapons found by excavators not illegal purchase no one for a long time because they are too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">More often, he says, vendors target stores military when they need a game.</seg>
<seg id="39">Through some ensign, the supplier purchase a unit, for example a TT pistol.</seg>
<seg id="40">The eliminated from the register and pass it over the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This one takes the gun to the city and sold to 900 euro per unit with two magazines", tells</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so that periodically, when it is necessary to fulfil the plan of discovery of crimes, carry out test purchases to traders of illegal weapons," added the clerk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"As a boutique of luxury"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The seller and the buyer are usually found through acquaintances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would take me to a "corner" where we could negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="46">The price of the weapon, I found only there."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Commentator military Viktor Baranets</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the clerk at the store. "I have a friend as well, but I don't trust too much into it".</seg>
<seg id="49">In the markets there are sellers, but there also has to reach, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked her to say that he had dropped a tooth to your daughter."</seg>
<seg id="50">I can even get a pair of brass knuckles of steel through a trusted person.</seg>
<seg id="51">He also told me the supplied only to me because he knows I will not reveal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The novice looking for weapons of different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when it was preparing to publish an article on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="54">The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">They handed him a photo album, where they had not "everything".</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like in a boutique of luxury", recalls the military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, will not offer a bait-and-switch: all there is you can try it.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we're going with the seller to the forest, where we put a white one.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Give Me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure you that the weapon shoots well, we start to negotiate," describes the procedure for the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", which offers to buy weapons "for different purposes".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">To this it does not require any document or personal meetings.</seg>
<seg id="63">"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buy a gun or a machine gun".</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Put on strike the employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the USA.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Up to a quarter of american teens find their first jobs as cashiers in "Mcdonald's"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the last days, in the United States has started a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast-food chains, such as "Mcdonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">By now no one dares to assert whether you will come or not this wave to the nine points, or if you have destined to lose forces and calm down in its early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protest actions have the support of the trade unions and a number of NGOS from the left.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase of the modest salaries paid by the employees of Wal-mart and the system of fast food, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions of workers in these companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this sector of the economy practically has not been occupied by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">What forty-six cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Stocks started the week, the day after thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States coomenzaba the orgy of discounts that captured millions of people, and that sometimes it was accompanied by clashes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">That day, some workers of the corporation Wal-mart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed picket of protest, along with trade unions and activists of the left in the shops of the corporation, whose products are addressed to people of modest income and moderate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Wal-mart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, and even vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the larger supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many poorly paid workers Walmart buy only at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and range of products have made Wal-mart one of the largest corporations of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the words two critical, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low price, in part because they pay little to their workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">These latter also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of a forklift or handheld scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That "Black Friday" the participants of the rally demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">For a typical worker of Wal-mart, which receives $ 9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to$ 12 per hour, this will cost the corporation of $ 3.2 trillion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is approximately 1.1% more than what you spend on wages now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart placed the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store they will only 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a year they will be spending the ridiculous amount of 12.39 dollars more than what you spend now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The supporters of Walmart comment satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and which is not caused any loss to the corporation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "Black Friday" lasted in their shops from 8 Thursday afternoon until midnight the following day, and, during that time, Wal-mart sold about 5000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total, their cash registers were the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the website of the left Huffington Post, who left his job "less than five employees of a Wal-mart and that the protest had been nothing more than "another trick of public relations", organized by the union of workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"It's free cash!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not precisely the large department stores Walmart (which in this progressive city do not have appreciation, and that's why for now there is none), but the "Mcdonald's" and other inexpensive restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">I mcdonald's says that sells billions of portions, and then not even you attach the sick and do not pay you for your honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, in accordance with the federal law and New York, the minimum wage is 7.25$ per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food restaurants are going to increase with time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one earns less than they do in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when almost the fourth part of american teenagers went through the Mcdonald's and worked there, behind the counter, part-time after school, but she still lived with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or they planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, constantly stumbling on some of the interviews with workers of Mcdonald's who complain that they have to live with this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment which author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning of Thursday in the Mcdonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the atm and cooks food quickly they start to pay at least$ 15 per hour, or whatever, that they are double its current minimum salary.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that in the fast-food industry will believe trade unions of workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The U.S. law prohibits the administration deny them this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with subtleties and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, rarely by the administration makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">But, for objective reasons, it is easy for the trade unions covering the sector of food rápid.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main is the excessive staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discordant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place that same day in other inexpensive restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action took place half of the rally in the Mcdonald's located near Times Square, which included several democratic politicians premises, in particular, the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: "Mcdonald's says it is selling billions of portions, and then not even gives a hospital or pay you for your honest work".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The protesters received the support of other leading democrats of New York, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the workers in the sector of fast food to achieve receive fair wages and the economic prosperity it deserves every new yorker".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times newspaper, this has been the greatest manifestation of this kind in the history of american fast-food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it took only a few hundred people, even not all of them were employees of the service of fast food, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people of New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not yet clear if this will serve as a spark to ignite a mass movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"For now, tricking the brain is not so easy"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The theme of the augmented reality, so popular among the fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal mainly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and subsequently, in November, it became known that Microsoft had also filed a request to claim the corresponding patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, a conversation with the head of the technology group interactive 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, we saw that for the scientists of the company, the glasses because they belonged to a last stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are attracted to the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dedicated to the human-computer interaction, but also we try to expand the limits of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">By now the humanity in their mass has been caught in the stage of work with the pixels of the screen, sometimes touch it with your finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess cardinal changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console, and the sensors Kinect represent a step forward, and today any Xbox is sold without Kinect, because all they are interested in the gesture control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What does the future hold?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that Kinect has led the interaction at the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of information has been improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very good yet.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, we work in systems of visualization truly three-dimensional, based on different technologiesa including the design.</seg>
<seg id="15">You must free the world of the computer to ours, the physicist, to make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the first place, to the devil with those fools helmets of a virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about the voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">A detail very popular, but don't you think that what they overestimate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It clear that it cannot be considered a panacea, it remains to solve the issue of privacy, because you do not always want the others know of our actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think of the gestures, but not in movements loose, but shorter.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but for a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">For now it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How is that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- How, for example, I would ask you to pass this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will speak and show at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually just talk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So, you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not do at this point the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine with precision the reactions of the person.</seg>
<seg id="35">These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If we talk about his work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect, what complaints you have a modern digital cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">What they lack is a resolution, depth or something more?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the recognition of three-dimensional.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get an 8-megapixel camera to the speed of 1000 fps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this would give more work to the designers of algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X And y axes, but also in Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The human movements are fairly dynamic, and the current of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for the gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable delay processing of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands what extent this affects the man-machine interaction.</seg>
<seg id="47">To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second to be more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And what is not necessary to increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the emitter of infrared rays and second, the receiver of reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the third house is actually a simple sensor range visible.</seg>
<seg id="51">This is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially the most amount of cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or, on the contrary, to increase and increase the required amount of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be good to create a similar flexible microsoft, play with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help to determinr the three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, it has not submitted his glasses to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Don't you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of technology of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms more visible?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, spend all the while holding high a smart phone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could spend the glasses to the smart phone,</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are devices very personal, that is their strength (the private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality-based glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of objects holographic virtual in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile feedback!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands don't feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers can prepare your group for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my speeches I often say that augmented reality is the seventh appearance on the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, one of the tricks most interesting is the use of the second-hand in the quality of support for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">Registers feel perfectly!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are truly aimed to provide tangibility to these "pictures in the air". For example, the interference of various rays, ultrasonic aimed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to the one you feel if someone was soplándole on the tips of your fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets to the wrist that influence the nerve ends of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to trick the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">What make you think that he feels what seems like I ought to feel in the moment you see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Personal taste is subjective in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Rosbalt" continues the project "Avant-garde of Saint-Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens that are in front, at the cutting edge of art and culture.</seg>
<seg id="3">In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: often found recognition in Europe without Russia to know even that.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found close to the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in meetings of fashion, and openings.</seg>
<seg id="6">The pictures of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, where you want to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of those scientists purely sociofilósofos of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg of the late 80's - early 90's.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it is a urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city wakes up in the citizens smiles and lifts to all the mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, he took his hands on a street organ and became the organ of St. Petersburg, as it has matured to make it as difficult role, for their existence bohemia, his philosophy and his image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose the color red, because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to the appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image-makers and the society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although in the society, everything that is not a little gray raises aggression and agitation of properties anything good.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are aimed to start a conversation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole story of my actions are provocative an invitation to the debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - When do you understood that you were to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - An exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where it is exhibited my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I realized that this was my path.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the surge of old artists who are not officers had been completed, and the new, free, like me, they were still misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">I became a friend of artists of the new wave, with the subsequent faced in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and already finished the new wave.</seg>
<seg id="22">I fell in the theatre for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - And all this is brought together in your Clinic of art... - it was important To me to find myself in the cultural centre of St. Petersburg, where he had to bring together the best creative minds.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I took a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reforms, there was a club artistic, musical, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian life of St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way in which Schnur brought the project to "La oreja de Van Gogh".</seg>
<seg id="26">Schnur and his friends sang songs light under a phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the currently composer of fashion Igor Vdovin.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg was animator many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training he has received from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Gallery "D-137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Clinic of the Art.</seg>
<seg id="31">There were our employees and permanent clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the award was "The people of our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was chosen me, so ended my culmination.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these new times is not convenient to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In our times it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are separated. One may be popular but very little cult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - There are in your work somewhat recognizable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - Many of my paintings are hits, in them is clearly expressed the present and the occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'm going to make an exhibition scheduled, "The Russian Museum in the clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns are a category timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">I was previously sociable, but now to be so painful and frightening.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clowns all smeared and the tragedy is removed.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the salvation of the world through a change totalitarian and mandatory clothes.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now one follow him on clothing, with a focus on the external, but not in the interior of the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">And, perhaps that person does not owe you or give the hand, but spat upon in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the deception will be deleted when you change clothes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - Recently we saw you in the role of organ grinder city. - A city cultured must have a hero as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who better than me to be!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Well, but, what the best commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Now the commercial art should be careful, sweet, have touch.</seg>
<seg id="52">We are witnessing the disintegration of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before people are brought together in herds, the bohemian wanted one thing, the simpletons other.</seg>
<seg id="54">These have now all been divided into microcomunidades, it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to appeal to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now we have to think about who you want to like it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now, every hero worship has its 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - And to listen to Stas Mihajlov come by the thousands!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - Go to see the abandoned, there works the sphere sex-social.</seg>
<seg id="60">And a cultural event, go 300 inhabitants, 10 thousand never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is withered.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have my fans, the most important thing is not to cheat, not to spoil what you have achieved.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young it was these paintings that a collector's had hung on the wall at the side of Falk and Larionov.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with paintings, with which people usually ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often confuse the concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">Say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money just to paint pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I'm in favor of this culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, what is it that you lack in St. Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - Good experts in culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is a concept: an official of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all of them may engage in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">When the kings were the correct all was in another way, the kings maybe they didn't understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to maintain the proper experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow there are now very good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have people in St. Petersburg that could well be experts, but are closed, because it requires experts to a higher level to assess properly to them and open up the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now is thriving personal taste is subjective.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all of the modern art is accepted, there are some artists that have to search for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - What is it for you to St. Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is a lot more culture, there is no ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">But on our stones it is difficult for the art grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need cultural field and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there are a lot of curious people who are going to exhibitions and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In our case, this class is tiny.</seg>
<seg id="84">We have to make art that is in vogue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project will be implemented with a grant of Saint-Petersburg.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board depart in search of a planet replacement.</seg>
<seg id="5">To preserve the humanity becomes the main question: How to continue the species in the conditions of weightlessness, or on the same planet of spare?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that there is little to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"These are Venus and Mars", says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, P.K. Sternberg (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if the conditions on Mars are best for life, on the surface of Venus is temperature of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in the space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">A half-century ago, which were carried out experiments with plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in anything from the varieties land.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, fruit flies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, he was sent to the space quail eggs to see how it develops in the embryo in conditions of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We get as a result a chick normal.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is that this chick has to find support, should be maintained on their own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Not finding support, the chicks were credited to chance.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 hours in the newborns will be given a total atrophy of the instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks not reacted to light or sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And the misfortune was that at the end of four days just to die.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And two times we were born chicks, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them",says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in the space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last time a "miniarca" biological flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, in the biosatélite "Bion" only travel species of the same sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats, which were submitted to the space already with fetuses.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there was nothing supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This was precisely in the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies such as this should be carried out", says Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing, the rats spatial had offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it has still not managed to address the problem of reproduction directly in the space.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is a difficult challenge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The animals, to lose their usual habitat, simply unable to perform his sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is able to create a fund appropriate emotional.</seg>
<seg id="36">Similar experiments not carried out for ethical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women travel into space from 50 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The increased risk what happened Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the most precious thing that has humanity is the female body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if you are after a flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">May or may not have a baby after this flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, this question no one has responded," says the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only one year after the flight to the space, the first female cosmonaut , Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut .</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, he had a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk persists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We are few, are counted astronauts who after long flights all of them have turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", summarizes the pilot-cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">However, humanity must find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, in the creation of the artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The hidrolaboratorio of the Center of preparation of cosmonauts is a compulsory stage in the preparation for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">In conditions of buoyancy null, the cosmonauts practice their skills of work in the space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water simulate weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If for an adult, the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, to a newborn child is your native elements.</seg>
<seg id="54">The young men-amphibian seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that the baby will be approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be more easy to get then to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bathroom spend only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, instructor of swimming of newborns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In summary, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary to gravity, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the weightlessness of the abdominal muscles and the pelvic decrepitan very fast, the capacity of expulsion of the fetus is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can, of course, to give light in a special chamber, the latter will push.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And what then?", Valeri Polyakov is doing this original question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs to artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress with a special suit to training, and to adults.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Simply deprive you of what it is vital for him.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment that we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring the Earth to a disabled person, a person totally unsuitable", provides for the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">By now, the birth of children in the space is a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, with time this will become a reality, when the human beings in their vessels to go to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in the space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given with the politician guilty</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and legislation of quality, although its implementation is missing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">So says Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect", but their application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack", and describes the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The joint controls of the inspectors czechs and germans also come to similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of a bad practice, mentioned the attitude of Petr Nečas to the system of autonomous being only on paper, which is known as the system "švarc".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) not bother to entrepreneurs with inspectors. Then, what is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be regulated in some way and if prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can hinder the performance of the office, which has the obligation to perform such controls or require obligations", notes Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the monitoring committee in the Congress of Deputies, You spoke of a joint project between the Czech team and the German, in the framework of which they compared the legislation regarding the public adjudications in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly is it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control that we started to get about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Said of a simplified way: the european legislation regulates how to organize the public adjudications, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and, later, the practice itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have united all and, even if the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained differences very interesting. Generally, the legislation of our country is "more strict and more complete", however, the praxis concrete in some parameters is better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This therefore confirms that it is not enough to incorporate rules becoming more stringent, but it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What can you bring to this project? What do you think are the conclusions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Precisely a common control of this type could contribute to that we stopped investing efforts in the implementation of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this does not have an impact as positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy of the savings of means to get a thing that is suitable for a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not for the fact reduce the limit of allocations want to say that we are going to get it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps because the system is saturated with both "paperwork", that those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do that more easily than if the limits are kept as high as now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You speak of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prácticaa of the public adjudications.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of controls in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">What is an office similar to our NKÚ or organized in other way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">How to offices, as the NKÚ, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a college also, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the powers are to a certain extent analógas, however, in both Germany has a federal organization, the courts of auditors are even at this level. In this aspect is slightly different from our system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we here call state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds, which are managed by the regions and the municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Accounts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In terms of the local law, what is more simple than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Usually, I would not like to establish a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany continues to be a model in some aspects, but you can't pin down exactly what is best.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What could be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I do not like to do this kind of comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to say that even those countries which we take as a model must deal with a large number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">If it were not, it would give them no benefit to collaborate with our office, don't you think?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In terms of the legislation of our country, what is meant to his Office the amendment of the law on the public adjudications? What manifests itself in any way to their incidence?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet manifested in the actions of control.</seg>
<seg id="35">Given that we carry out ex-post controls, it is necessary to count with a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For now, it is in the process of preparation of the controls future: we have started a new tool "detection of risks of non-economic", for which we have done spend nearly 14,000 public adjudications, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, because they change the limits, are rectified the conditions of some kinds of the process of selection and similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial, or, rather, represents a mess for the bureaucratic system?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that it is so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that may arise is that the legislation "harden" and that it is impossible to do it.</seg>
<seg id="40">As with the previous legislation, the persons controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law is not respected in the field of public adjudications meant the violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Does it make sense then to toughen the law this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think not this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not to punish those who commit a fault formal, which has no impact on decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">A system of this type will only create a more bureaucratic pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">What and how do you get out of this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We'll see where we take this road started.</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister has recently said that the ODS did not bother to entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called system švarc, with reference to the fact of being self-employed only on paper. What does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Does the system švarc" is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be regulated in some way and, if prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can hinder the performance of the Office, which has the obligation to perform such controls and demand obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say: "we will Change the law and allow it", but you can't say that we will do as if nothing had happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict in the way that they should act formally. And that is as it should be to protect the public authority.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic that you exclude the candidate with the best offer does not comply with the formal requirements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but their application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is said that in a little less than a month is going to reach the end of the world, what do you think about it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is only one among many other news alarmist to which we like to hold on to.</seg>
<seg id="4">The music group The Tap Tap we like rather to make jokes about this, and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that is able to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In addition, in December you also organize a project really original: three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you explain to our readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a charity event state that we have been planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to take advantage of the potential of marketing that has the end of the mayan calendar statement to the 21st of December at 11:10 in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">The previous day, the 20th of December to 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">Will end up at about the same time that the mayan calendar ends on the island Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially it was my idea, after we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key chains against the end of the world which can be purchased in www.e-tap.czanother form of support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group of The Tap Tap, along with other performers, he also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, who goes by the title "End of the world, cancelled".</seg>
<seg id="16">It is currently very popular on YouTube, what you may hear in the charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Yes, and it will be just the latest, good, as long as everything goes well and it is not the end of the world...</seg>
<seg id="18">The sing all the performers at the same time in the three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hymns will be linked among themselves simultaneously thanks to the relay special live on Czech Television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and interprets the role of Jesus in the video clip, where she also sang Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did this collaboration?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We put all our effort in participating in this project.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in and we have fun to work with us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What you will use the money raised at the concert against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.</seg>
<seg id="27">The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers who perform activities that are fun and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students do not have sufficient financial means to pay the teachers and we efuerzo to make it possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building that we will continue with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In every concert act several groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What are the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Do you have scheduled some other "spectacular action" similar in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In may we will act for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here surely we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">The next year we would also like to touch on the Bohemian National Hall in New York and to me, personally, while we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your plans in foreign countries are not exactly minimalist, up to now, ye have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How is the logistics and organization of these trips?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not so difficult how can seem at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">There are five members in electric wheel chair, chairs must travel in the baggage compartment and in addition we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the tools...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, up until now, we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, a thing that never ceases to amaze me.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we have come back a little while ago, everything went smoothly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of the society towards the handicapped, and other aspects.</seg>
<seg id="46">What have you found so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here, in Russia we have been witnesses of that in the east there is a long way to go.</seg>
<seg id="48">Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common that a person move alone through the centre of the city in an electric wheelchair.</seg>
<seg id="49">Something as mainstream as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair lift, there is not.</seg>
<seg id="50">Luckily, he has created a civil association that strives to thematize the problems of persons with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In what aspects we should take example from countries more advanced?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many aspects in which we are behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the development and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people it affects directly.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is very normal for people with a severe disability to move on their own in public and you can go to the service, to the museum, where you want to...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities to participate in the social life of active form, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap go a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes in the arising eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will start to change all of the truth.</seg>
<seg id="57">Up to now, are isolated cases of people who have a great strength of will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group of The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if you look a few years ago, what drove you to form the group in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I joined as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, founded a group amateur with a coworker.</seg>
<seg id="61">And with the time, as it says in our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we were a little out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">However, the popularity did not come up to these past few years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us quite the fact connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work is not seen, it is as if it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can afford in addition to quality teachers, equipment, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">What you were intending to reach so far with The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I saw the potential that he had, that you can do something in another way.</seg>
<seg id="68">The world of the show is full of things that look like the one to the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical, in its own way, everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are a few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...</seg>
<seg id="72">But compassion is entirely superfluous because people with disabilities are not beings abandoned to suffer and that we should have compassion.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that you have the necessary means.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if something goes well to people with disabilities, then, is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">What helped the fact that You are a demanding boss, as he describes many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that is completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come with a romantic view and with the head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the test in high school and spend a lot of time travelling, and in concert, the initial excitement them quickly leaving.</seg>
<seg id="79">But this is how it works on all parties, in each group that you want to work and get something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently the group the Tap Tap has twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were already in the beginning of the year 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, the people coming in and out, you can't avoid.</seg>
<seg id="84">Whoever has will and desire you always find the doors open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 to 21 hours</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Will take place at Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda of Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups, and other musicians of the Czech Republic</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">The three cities will be connected to the end of the evening through video conferencing to sing together the song of the group of the Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance equipment multifunctional educational center without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav of Prague, the cost of which amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entrance at the option of advance sales in Bohemiaticket</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">At the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held the last week was accepted Poland as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member country of THAT of the old block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in the year 1994, and during the subsequent years he participated in the commission of the projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began long before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Enthusiasts poles because they were dedicated to the flights to the space before the Second World War, although it is not always understand his work.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas about the pioneering study "Introduction to the cosmonauts".</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one that had shown interest in your work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the year 1934 Šternfeld obtained in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch by his "Introduction to the cosmonauts".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, was later turned into a major driver of astronomy and of the cosmonauts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Published hundreds of articles in magazines Polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonauts, was known all over the world and their contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that would be provided with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and not known the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresina or braking.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the year 1933, the Polish artillery began to engage missiles.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia, in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the material preserved, it becomes evident that the research came to the stadium of the practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, with the arrival of the German troops, he interrupted the research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the year 1937 appeared in the trade press the prototype of a missile hunting photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were intended for use by the military of the engines for missiles.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, the scientific advisory Committee, provisional (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all the projects of technical missiles for military use and coordinated all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other studies dedicated to the cosmonauts appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">In the November edition of 1954 issue of the journal Problemy is referenced for the first time to the society with four articles is very extensive dedicated to the astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, prof. M. Subotowicze, it proposed the creation of a society that is devoted to the cosmonauts.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time we had already launched projects of artificial satellites, and it was obvious that the research cosmic was a discipline with future prospects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and, in the fall of that same year, the PTA became a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), he became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">Served in this position until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first rocket Polish in which he carried out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket had a height of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and there came to the weight of 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, he finished building the version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 testing began aerial rockets RM-2 two-stage in the Błędów desert.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was to 1.4 metres and weighed about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another type of rocket development was to be the object of scientific study real. The rocket RM-34 was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission is to control the wind height.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962, he suspended the work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor of the first rocket of type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Developed three types (so-called Meteor-1A, -1B-1C), which differed from each other by the space available for the scientific apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the rocket Meteor-1A to the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The peak maximum at the three types age of 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between the years 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Institute of Air rocket Meteor-2, whose first tests airlines began in October of 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to bring a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km height.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later-built version Meteor-2 and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is necessary to mention also the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on artificial satellites soviet and, in the year 1978, the Polish driver Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimir Remek.</seg>

<seg id="1">The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The last week the constitutional court suspended the law traabajos social.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution aroused a heated discussion in the society.</seg>
<seg id="4">From then it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, is based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.</seg>
<seg id="6">In consequence, this means that the different economic forms and economic systems nationals are in permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free movement and unlimited private equity, along with rampant financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The effect of the large differences in the cost of labour (wages) produces economic stresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, try to shorten distances and for this "causes a bajadda" of the price of the competitor with the aim of becoming the largest part of the market and, thus, increase its profit margin.</seg>
<seg id="10">Large-scale means, for the majority of entrepreneurs, to shift production abroad, where we can buy cheaper or disappear. The result is high unemployment in those countries in which the price of the work, in comparison with other economies, is higher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the private capital has no liability for any social and, with it, nor is it responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows necessarily the state social spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">This whole situation conducive to the total lack of interest of employers by paying taxes and compensate for the damage in economic and social, which have resulted in their eagerness to obtain benefits.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to submit statistical data concrete.</seg>
<seg id="14">The practical little scrupulous of private equity creates situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of the population itself and, in this way, to attract foreign capital to the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Put another way, the governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is evident especially in the changes of the laws in force.</seg>
<seg id="17">The objective is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in regard to wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This takes place, on the one hand, by the system of financial obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, by the restricted right of the employees in terms of employment rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty along with the increase of the differences between the rich and the poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">For a number of years, there are in Germany points of delivery of food to poor people who cannot stay with their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people receiving this type of aid arrives as one million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the framework of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a common occurrence: persons employed with a wage so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.</seg>
<seg id="23">It became a public scandal of this kind in connection with the situation of the support staff of the German federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The savings measures of practically all the states of the south of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. The people, led by a decline abysmal of their social level, they are forced to migrate as in the NINETEENTH century or malvivir with a salary lousy in the limit of the society, with the hope that some day it arrives in the country's capital private investor.</seg>
<seg id="25">What it is necessary to preguntrarse where it comes from?</seg>
<seg id="26">In the case of other countries of the EU, then the poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, because chinese, indian, brazilian, Turkish, moroccan, egyptian or africans still working for a tiny part of a salary european.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also affects the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theories and the media claim to the gills that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, to steer the economy leads to their failure.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private equity defend tooth and nail with the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy getting in the control.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then, it is necessary to ask if the private capital does not influence with his selfishness in the gear policy and, therefore, all over the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this case the answer is clearly yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all the states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation, which manifests itself in the field of corruption, in the favors to each other, in a law that is practically reprehensible in all parts, but is not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is the following: the state ministries, lack of financial means, in charge of the drafting of bills to law firms, private, which are often linked with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">This type of bills are approved after the Bundestag, the German parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this way, all power emanates from the people, as is announced in the constitutions of the western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like the one that describes Appiános in his work " The crisis of the roman republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations are occupied by force."</seg>
<seg id="38">In exchange for bribes, favors obtained unlawfully and helps to finance stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption are extended without any impediment and the people went to the polls to vote agreed beforehand",... "there are no people with character that aspirara to a post in the administration, so that once, because of this confusion, the state was eight months without consuls"... "Began to speak seriously that the only remedy for the situation so serious was the autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic guy"... Although Appiános thought in Pompey, Caesar came to power and transformed democracy forever in autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion, in the same way that in ancient times, is that the current society is based on preferences inconsiderate of the individual profit without taking into account the common interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital is not capable, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is the same as that of then, a decline of the elite unprecedented, without make an effort to reform it in depth.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must be sought, therefore, in the liberalisation of unbridled economic systems in the NINETEENTH and TWENTIETH century.</seg>
<seg id="44">With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems to the benefit of a type liberal democracy, as a pause defined, waiting for the next blow.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact really devastating is that the elite current completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, catastrophes, social and humanitarian that we have been witnesses, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in the ancient history and the most recent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the economic competition, both at international level and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is, therefore, systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is to reform socio-political concrete, to strengthen the participation of the capital of the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the society to the benefit of the state.</seg>

The other supports the palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel and the genocide perpetrated against palestinian arabs and blemish to Israel of state terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="6">I don't want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. In the end, the citizens of today's Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not lived the beginning of the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">My intention is to provide readers with a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who takes advantage of the tensions that are dragged from 95 years ago (calculated on the basis of the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, in other conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the issue, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the history of humanity, the history of the struggle for the power is in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every age we can find an Alexander the Great, or a Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">But what is not as clear is if you always were these characters that directed their steps autonomously or if behind his throne there was someone who guided their actions towards a certain goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power that this implies, has not been able to reach in a single generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among these families astronomically rich highlights one that could be considered to be the most prominent (if still there is someone behind, I don't know, but do not rule out): the Rothschild.</seg>
<seg id="14">Do not write much about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Naturally.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the 90s of the XIX century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to cease to associate its name with criminal acts of a lot of gravity. The power and wealth, or both of them, they covered the back, something that for them it always meant a strengthening.</seg>
<seg id="17">Have significant holdings in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries that are not represented, has been declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq were 5, after the overthrow Gaddafi there were left only four, but in the meantime Russia has made the central bank of the Russian government.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to print money and I wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was assassinated in 1963, the congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after wanting to sue the FED have triggered by the great economic crisis of 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">His eagerness for the world power led them over the years 1859 - 1871 to map out a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, awarded with the degree 33.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was marked as the objective to remove the large states monarchists in the whole of Europe; the second he wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (like amount of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and does not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more that a draft for such a solution), and the final adoption of the absolute powers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method with which operates the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschild, follow the dynamics of the outbreak of the crisis and the subsequent offering a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always carry a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created to not allow a crisis as the year 1907.</seg>
<seg id="25">So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the throne of austria-hungary, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, should have sparked the First World War, destroyed the tsarist Russia with the beginning of the bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the point of view of military and economic, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end with the tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent break-up of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.</seg>
<seg id="27">To prepare the ground of the Second World War, allowed the bankers and politicians to create, stealth mode, a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, which created the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the masses of impoverished people. Later, they took with them to the germans for the solution of the Fuehrer, which was strong enough and simple, and pointed out the guilty, and build after a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority who was to represent and accounted for as well the function of the fifth column, which took the flame and led to the outbreak of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the NINETEENTH century, the Rothschilds, promoted the foundation of the zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a jewish state, preferably in the region of the ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The Balfour declaration, referred to above, laid the groundwork for the massive immigration of jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the arab population of the place.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were terrorist attacks in both parties.</seg>
<seg id="31">After the outbreak of the Second World War: it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope to which he had tied the international bankers in the beginning or if all they did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of european jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the jewish state in the world society.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, in a way similar to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way towards the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was created, the focus for a third war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers managed to log back on, the jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now along with the arab population, or, generally, a muslim in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is a laboratory immense, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the framework of its country, but also at the international level. Let us take as an example how to split so blunt the supporters and critics of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian conflict? Where the injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of violence in endless, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of a few individuals and their eagerness for the world power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as it happens in our country, the international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist, loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything possible to declare war on Iran, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the strait of Hormuz, through which passes the 20% of all the oil the world (the corridor of navigation has only two miles wide), which would lead to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Movie Argo: If you put a crude, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a group of the manifestation of islamist students occupied the american embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.</seg>
<seg id="3">His release was going to be to change the overthrown shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution, he fled to the USA, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the american administration the situation does not offer any positive perspective: pull the shah overboard could not afford it, because, if I did, would endanger the trust of its partners in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, it was not within its scope.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified even more with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention negotiator of the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the USA, your destination caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="9">The failure in Iran contributed in a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the presidential election of 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film "Argo" of the director and actor Ben Affleck tematiza an episode of this story, which was a small success for America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Little before taking the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a difficult journey, ended up in the residence of the canadian embassy.</seg>
<seg id="13">CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for it helped a story disguised a point extravagant: and they went out with canadian passports, as members of the film crew that examined the location in the country for the filming of a blockbuster science-fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan outlined in the expert "exfiltración" Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the lie it seems true, they wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, organized press conferences, the production company fictitious even had an office real.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film was made from the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film Affleck is a unique combination of various genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, a political thriller realistic; on the other, a so-called "caper movie," the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, we combine the states of mind. We find on the one hand sequences well-documented Tehran. In the sequence of credits are displayed photographs emblematic of the time of the events, which were reflected in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other, typical scenes of Hollywood a much more lightweight, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And in addition, scenes from the central of the CIA and other institutions: men in tails that analyze the situation at the table of negotiations, in the corridors of the office, by phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career as an excellent way.</seg>
<seg id="24">The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, it has become a director respectable and its mode of action has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye small, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is the first film to Affleck in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that was located to the directors of old films above standards of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck and it shows in Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events is true. The introductory sequence of the decision of the embassy is impressive by its ability synoptic that, at the same time, conveys the excitement of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, in any place, the story takes a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on the fictitious scenes (the computer impostor in the bazaar of Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to accept the fact that a story explained not offer much in the sense film the scenes more intriguing.</seg>
<seg id="33">And manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here not get everything so elegant (the scene in which threatens the crisis in the airport of Tehran, the deviation of a call to America and the wild search after your tennis become a craze).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin, and John Goodman have a role very funny as collaborators of Hollywood, even though their characters are they deserved more space and are not, or much less, the only ones in this film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For these reasons, the film Affleck loses a bit of stroke dramatic, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate rate of interest, assess its performance, and the retro style of a thriller that is reminiscent of the 70s.</seg>
<seg id="37">But to collapse, it will be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">As evocation of a true story, and as evidence of the exaggerated that may be the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, it is enough.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules for the inflated balloons, bananas, and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on bank rates more absurd, has now decided to announce the competition on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the workshop of the EU".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a share of 40 percent of women in management positions in large european companies," he explained hungary and croatia Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the absurdidades nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the european court of unifying the insurance policies between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, women are held with best rates on life insurance because objectively represent a lower risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Other great ideas from the workshop of the EU may be proposed by the people until the end of this year."</seg>
<seg id="7">The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013", reported Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the regulations controversial of the EU is, for example, the mandatory addition of components of the fuel, as a result, damaging the environment; another ban the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or guideline about the size of cages for hens, which has contributed to the considerable increase of the price of eggs this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It has been criticised the ban factual use of the expression "butter to grease" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb of the trades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A banana quality should have a length of 14 inches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The apparatus of the Union takes this type of decisions, often under the pressure of one or another lobby commercial or industrial, whose petitions in Brussels are defended normally by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that bananas higher quality should be taken in the EU to a length of at least 14 inches and could not present "abnormal curvature".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended himself by saying that with this only seeks to harmonise national rules are not adjusted to date, which only complicated marketing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rules that make reference to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the EU last year, according to which in the inflatable balloons that are marketed it is obligatory to warn that children under the age of 8 years old are not allowed to inflarlos without the supervision of an adult.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU made no reference here to an american study, according to which, when speaking of toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is also force a similar restrictions applicable to the use of matasuegras on the part of children up to 14 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Occurrences curious born even in our country</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Equally absurd is the regulation concerning the european officials: anyone have any official role in the EU can not use the name of Macedonia. To not offend the sensibilities of Greece, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of economists liberal Laissez-Faire, was nominated in the survey, between some absurd proposals referred to above, the prescription of the Union about the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU determined the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">After, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for mushrooms in retained, which was a threat of substantial fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey also were interested in the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of giving a grant to the grant application.</seg>
<seg id="24">This kind of ideas do not emerged in Brussels but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage due to the fact of not having sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We ask the European Union to compensation", declared in the fall of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">I argued with the fact that in our country, it produces much grain, and, as a result of the call of intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and I had to export.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Bits, given that the Czech Republic is far from the sea port, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission is ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">The grant to receive a grant was given to the municipalities by the ministry for local development led by the minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is aimed at the drafting of requests for subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: The prescriptions rare are an exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in the area of regulations and, also, a functioning and development more effective in the whole Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of the european integration, but that the member states have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The czechs were also strikes a chord, in the same way as other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country is not always have emerged victorious from these struggles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The czechs, after six years of disputes with German and austrian, defended successfully the appellation of origin of cottage cheese of Olomouc, but they had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the NINETEENTH century, and was renamed "tuzemák".</seg>
<seg id="36">Only products made from the distilled from sugar cane can be called ron, but not those made from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the formal listing of protected designations of origin in the EU, along with cheese feta and gorgonzola known all over the world, the marzipan of the German city Luebeck or Parma ham, as are, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Pohořelice and Třeboň, and even the variety of hops Žatec.</seg>

<seg id="4">If in our country everything off well, then it would not present my candidature.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can't bear to see how it steals in the last twenty years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had ambitions of being a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">When I see something that I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I already have forty years, and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Senate has already come, but soon after it has been put on the path to the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is not giving back to those who have voted?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the elections of the senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I pointed out that if he was elected senator, would present my candidature for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can realize my own ideas.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the mandate strong as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticise in the bar or in front of the television, but that we ride roughshod over anyone who wants to start a change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this we add the media, that you desprestigian and confuse the freedom of expression and the freedom of lying.</seg>
<seg id="17">Part of me says that I have bribed journalists or that I have been advisor Jiri Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's talk about your ideas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is presented to the fight presidential thesis financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property for over twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To do this you must change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the president does not have this competition and only the senate as a whole, may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a citizen, I have formed part of a group lobbying for the job of a guide to be recognized as autonomous work, and what we got.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is in the policy: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either right-wing or left-wing, is rejected by the way and this affects the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups.</seg>
<seg id="26">Without encasillamientos or dogmas of the party, I have the ability to choose something from every party that is best for our country and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What is considered rather a man of right-wing or left-wing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I considered to be more left-wing.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it does not matter, whether it is a bit of a left-wing or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">What matters to me is that we come out ahead.</seg>
<seg id="31">I don't care if someone is right or on the left, I want to bring people together.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or of the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Makes a joke when it is said of You that is a populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But what is not showing with what it says?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you try to approach them.</seg>
<seg id="37">There will be those who call populism, but all the proposals of which I speak are already working in the world or known experts speak of them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of the parliament he has only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that, it can not survive in the long-term policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that if it is directed to the people and talk with them, get, for example, a criminal liability and financial?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I don't have another option.</seg>
<seg id="42">Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to get it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If elected president, there should be no problem to arrange a live broadcast on television in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties that legitimaran criminal responsibility and financial support to politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.</seg>
<seg id="44">And, eventually, they would have to communicate, why don't you want.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong character that points to the dispute, it may put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the case of the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of the public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time I say that I'm just an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For my opinions and ideals try to look for allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">I just started on the policy and try to get as much support as possible for my program.</seg>
<seg id="50">I try to take things forward it myself, but in case that doesn't work out, within six years, I'll leave and I'll return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Sounds a bit as if Okamura off to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that with a person I don't do anything, that's why I have visited a number of well-known personalities, for if you encourage to submit his candidacy to the senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to see Radim Jančura, but refused because I had a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, that brought to light the fraud with light oils of heating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I sat on the basis of which the people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in the balance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of the population went to the polls and, those who did so, they voted for the representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the senate we are two of the independent sector.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people elected to the senate, in such a way that it will be hard to achieve changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, I will defend my own ideas, as for example the direct election of mayors or governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">What is considering to form his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I haven't considered because I don't have time for it, to check the past unblemished of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I don't have money even to the campaign for the presidency, in my account transparent only 20,000 crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Do not have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">Speaking of statements of the property, how is yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I estimate my private ownership in some 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a floor reviewed ten million, another floor priced at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, it was gallant with the women, and, at the same time, struggled against the evils and injustices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">What drives an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic but do not want to put too much money on your part.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million to the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Do I have to endeudarme?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that you don't have any sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my program.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money out of my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">The expenses of the campaign covered in essence what will I receive in respect of the salary of a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I could not make a living doing it. For example, I could not pay my son the English school, that it costs 30,000 crowns a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I would like only to make money, then I would run as a candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">What is so that it will continue with its business activity in order to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">What has not been said before that I was going to stop this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This has nothing to do with a salary greater.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, in part have I left my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people would like the samaritan save the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I need to live for something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much do you usually win a monthly basis as an entrepreneur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Between 200,000 and 400,000, that I keep winning.</seg>
<seg id="89">If you were president, then he would leave the business.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The study of architecture MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I think that the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by passing by in the street.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "in addition, the building is nice."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder, do we need the library today.</seg>
<seg id="5">We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one comes to taste in those libraries old-fashioned, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the doors of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honour of having been raised with a record to forget.</seg>
<seg id="8">The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the literacy rate lowest of the Low Countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">To counteract this situation as shameful, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven bridges fictitious that are represented in the euro notes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete decorated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the offensive education was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so it was as policy-makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: we had to build a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, the study of architecture Dutch MVRDV, a master in the art of the bar charts and responsible for buildings fun at the same cynical, took issue with his usual quiet manner, and appeared to the presentation of the contest in the year 2003 with five books under one arm and a smile on the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury looked puzzled her around and shrug, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and he concluded his short speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:</seg>
<seg id="14">Here it is, my proposal to the mountain of books Spijkenisse, the so-called `Boekenberg'".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the expected place.</seg>
<seg id="16">It will form part of the revitalization project, which is complete with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of blocks of flats and terraced houses.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize for "Best Library of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In this way, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian area postmodern and a town hall incredibly ugly after whose white facade one intuiría rather a central lechera, now has a piece of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first building of the cultural public of its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long way to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is true that there is an elevator that takes us right to the center of this mountain massif, but true lovers of space and reading not to use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of your climb to the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">The interior completely glassed is bright and easy-to-cover with the view, the brick floor annealing and the elegant lamps support unequivocally the condition public library.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">To boost the view can come to the view on the park benches, dogs and children and girls playing football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And by all sides books, books and more books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that, in general, tends to be rather uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">What we have done is to upend the classical configuration space and make the reading area of the interior to the exterior.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet, the chess club, the center for environmental education and the room maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special mention deserve the shelves black assume the functions of the wall, parapet and railing at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sight, touch and smell are strangers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and civil engineers more the day you shake your head when you hear talk of this unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so it is as a day, on a farm in friesland, we find ourselves with the product right from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">From many years ago, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands is using a plastic tissue of a few millimeters thick as a basis for holding the roots of the crops.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a cheap material and efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">This tissue lasts for two seasons and then dispose of it.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library this tissue is prensó, for the first time in such amounts, up to get plates of four centimeters thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and resistant that smells like a mix of new car and sneaker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps you will reach the top of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain ahead of us the reward: from the coffee shop not only do you have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy a tasty cakes Dutch and their ficus planted in huge pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">These create a pleasant atmosphere to the few that keep atmospheric moisture appropriate for this mountain of literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Although it may be hard to believe, given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," notes Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The heating and the cooling necessary are obtained from geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours in its interior.</seg>
<seg id="48">The huge roof trusses of wooden located in the transverse direction to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb the majority of the sun's rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">This creates a comfortable indoor climate.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest is a thing of the automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker of the industry of Information Technologies, already has dared to set foot in the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Equally, the professor of traditional chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "soul late" for Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks, you are invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection.</seg>
<seg id="55">This form is intended to fill, for the moment, the hollow optical a library that does not yet have its entire file; currently has 70,000 copies.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has penetrated deep.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are full to the brim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than a library half-empty," says the architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the citizens have a certain link with this building.</seg>
<seg id="60">You all know that your book is part of the library.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although only be there to adorn.</seg>
<seg id="62">In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a success in this discipline reigns in the slang specialized known as "creation of an identity."</seg>
<seg id="63">The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">Regardless of how young and uneducated that you can be.</seg>
<seg id="65">Finally a starting point to conform to his identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The germans should play a more active role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in the relations EE. UU.Europe, this puts Berlin in a diplomatic position rather tricky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: earlier this week, Germany gave to understand that it would vote against the proposal to grant the palestinian territories, the status of observer State of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Eventually, however, Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the israelis have done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, due to the special relationship that links the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think that it does not endorse the american stance.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising that took place in Libya in march 2011, Germany will also abstained when the point was to establish an area of prohibition of flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has been declared finally by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do you find it difficult to Germany to adopt a clear position when they are at stake international issues important?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is because in these moments is refocusing its foreign policy, moving away from a policy-led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">And what makes things worse is that europeans do not have a coherent and uniform.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, the germans are at a crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="18">They would be expected to play a more independent role, but are not accustomed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think they are still trying to get a feeling what will be your role, but you have already started on the path to a foreign policy "normal".</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What do you mean specifically a foreign policy "normal" from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is shown prepared to defend a different stance to the United States or its european partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in the economic policy, that is to say, in exports, and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests germans are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and that is why Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What these economic interests have influenced the stance adopted regarding the conflict in the middle East and in the voting of the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the middle East, especially in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">For this reason, you must be careful and not alienarse of arab public opinion, nor of the elites of the arab.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is important, of course.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not give so much importance because it is not a relationship entirely one-sided.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it does play a fundamental role in the considerations German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">What has undermined Germany its relationship with EE. HE is to abstain from voting on important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position has a huge degree of understanding.</seg>
<seg id="33">For this reason, I do not think that there has been a break so drastic as in the case of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps with this, Germany has managed to gain a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the end, all this has done nothing but prove that it is a country to which taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests are taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the initiative palestine.</seg>
<seg id="37">In contrast, EE. HE has shown clearly in favour of a ban.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is there a disparity of opinions between EE. U.S. and many european nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">There have always been these disparities due to the american domestic policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration shows in secret a great understanding to the european position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But, because of the political situation that you live here, it is clear that the government can not defend in public that stance.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think the real difference of opinion does not really have the importance that was attached to it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we analyze the relations between Obama and israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for nothing enthusiastic about the policy that develops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Do you find it difficult to Germany to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that this is precisely what makes it so difficult for germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course that would be a little easier for the germans if there is a european policy coherent and consistent, but it is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, do not have the possibility of being part of a superior being, but that should push things from your own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future, Germany will assume a leadership role at the time of forcing Europe to adopt a european position.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course this is not at all easy to Germany, as it is simply because of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a topic a sticky.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think that the germans have clear who should play the role of independent figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Do you see Germany itself in the role of significant international actor? Do you want to actually Germany take a leading role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or maybe he is still finding it difficult to accept that leadership?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not yet been used, it is always a little uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still costing play a more important role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that each time that Germany is positioned as the main actor, they are dismissed certain feelings antialemanes.</seg>
<seg id="57">This is not easy for the germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is an old problem, which is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">Seen in this way, Germany is in a position much more difficult than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It should show an attitude which is opposite to the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of EE. U.S. policy in the european decreases each time more, but the EU does not cover of time that void, who is left then?</seg>
<seg id="62">The germans they will have no choice but to assume a more active role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you don't like it, if they find it unpleasant, or if it becomes a town even more unpopular, c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a drawer, in which saves seats of the trademark office of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the 14th of September 2010, a chinese company ordered to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also served as the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The chinese are the world champions in that copy and violate the intellectual property rights is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities there are large department stores of various plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the cases of Pattloch are of another nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office granted an official chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered in another place.</seg>
<seg id="17">The chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or brand companion.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word has its origin in the chinese term "Bang Dakuan",</seg>
<seg id="19">that refers to women who have "caught" a rich man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The chinese authorities do not feel guilty</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is detrimental to the business, we have to fight against this", requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is huge."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and the costs of the proceedings of the affected sectors are millionaires, especially in the case of the flagship products of luxury.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data of the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of up to 15,000 million euros a year China is, in size, the third market of luxury goods and the growing pace.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, to achieve the cancellation of registration of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks it is difficult, and also makes a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="26">The processes can be extended up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because he had been so for a long time that the name subject of the complaint since it had become a "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"If the applicant has bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged the brand of this in China," notes Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has been absorbed by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is why today the chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used at the beginning of a logo in white, and blue that reminded greatly BMW; the issue was solved in the courts and Geely had to modify it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer of clothing Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The chinese authorities do not feel guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The trademark office CTMO in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.</seg>
<seg id="37">Last year, however, "the situation of emergency work returned to normal".</seg>
<seg id="38">In this way, the amount of processes of complaint no deal has been reduced by 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57.000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, 81.500 claims are still pending resolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To fight against this costs a lot of money</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As usual in China, the numbers are staggering.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for protection of marks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It would be a new record, and it means that China leads for the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations throughout the world, as shown by the trademark office.</seg>
<seg id="45">It seems that this also happens with the number of logos valid, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 they would have pocketed 1,800 million yuan in the concept of rights.</seg>
<seg id="47">Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To fight against this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the group fight in the courts against a chinese imitator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Although the germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacturing of auto parts watches,</seg>
<seg id="51">the simulator has managed to ensure the rights of chinese on the brand Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the last names are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Ceo of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the munich.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the following two instances I have given reason to Freudenberg, but the opposing party is still fighting in the present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">You have to have very, very carefully</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the case has come to the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler hope to be able to favorably resolve the issue and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".</seg>
<seg id="59">It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the file's business has had to review records of up to one hundred years old to be able to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago Freudenberg offered to the other party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly settlement, but did not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This shows how much we care," notes Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers that lurk in the Far East, threatening even to affect Europe,</seg>
<seg id="63">specifically, if the imitators ensure there the rights on trademarks are not protected.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thus, a chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.</seg>
<seg id="65">A long time ago that the group abandoned this business area, nevertheless managed to prevent the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"We have to be very, very carefully," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the attorney Pattloch recommend to German companies to be extremely careful when doing business with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what you have to do is to "register also in China everything that may be subject to protection", as noted by Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the subject may be much more expensive than a simple registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, in the case of Freudenberg missed the last assault of your particular battle, then he would have to pay to the other party rights of a license by its own name, as explained Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Either that or in the segment in question we expulsarían of the market.</seg>

<seg id="1">World day of the fight against AIDS: dancing, singing, help</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg tried the choir Imbongi and in Swaziland are glad AIDS orphans</seg>
<seg id="3">The story of a link able to overcome that much more of 8.733 miles away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First it begins with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes and loafers are looking for the bar on the ground floor, and find it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">One, two, three, four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only then begin to rise slowly to the voices of the singers (alto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, entorpeciéndose and followed each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatens to spiral out almost of their boxes when you try to put in order with his energetic gestures and soft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">They have also reached the fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years, from the geneticist human until the master of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every voice in the chorus has a different text and also in a foreign language, hardly known: the zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in south Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help for self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to an estimate of UNAIDS, the United Nations program for the fight against AIDS, in all the world there are approximately 34 million people infected by the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million of them live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland there is 245.000 AIDS orphans.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than 40% of the population is already hiv-positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The association Voices for Africa has been found in Germany sponsors for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.</seg>
<seg id="17">Seventy of them attend secondary school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.</seg>
<seg id="19">This contribution will cover the tuition of the school, the uniform and ensure that you have a hot meal a day in the Gogo Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in zulu "storyteller" or "advocate".</seg>
<seg id="21">In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this bantu language, but sing themselves know.</seg>
<seg id="22">From ten years ago this choir rehearses the songs on this soft foreign language sometimes achieved by transporting them to their place of origin: south Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">To 8.733 kilometers of distance in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of the choir German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent is infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Approximately 2,000 people live there, some even in simple huts of mud and straw, a large part of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 no longer have parents, because they have succumbed to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="27">Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the rate of AIDS infection higher and life expectancy lower around the world, according to Unicef.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population does not see with good eyes circumcision, a practice that according has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40% of the population of Swaziland are carriers of the virus of immunodeficiency, and die with something more than thirty years it has become something usual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">During a trip set to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw on the whole were many children in the streets that they lacked not only of the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing, and training.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without title and education, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the beginning it was only the commitment particular of the few that made it possible for a child off to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for just a few euros.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, a year after the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which since then has occupied professionally of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">Between the ETS of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="37">The ETS viral most common are the AIDS, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crabs and scabies are among the ETS-borne parasites.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main groups affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch Institute is part of the base that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the case of adult heterosexual, sexually transmitted diseases most common infections are chlamydia, trichomonas, the human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungus), and gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, in approximately 20% of new HIV infections recorded in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to european surveys, three-quarters of all infections affecting young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the diseases that are common among the youth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has it evolved the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections remains on a downward trend since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, we recorded approximately to 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is one-tenth less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often they do not cause pain or cause other symptoms, and that is why they are not detected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can one protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer protection to one hundred percent.</seg>
<seg id="58">Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and by physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">For this reason, the experts recommend to undergo regular medical examinations, especially if it is changed with the frequency of sex partner.</seg>
<seg id="60">If diagnosed early, most STDS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through partnerships, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances in the whole of Germany, they raise a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", notes proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini a woman sure of herself and with leadership skills administers the money sent from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">Takes care of the orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The "dancers", as is called for elderly women in zulu, are the pillars of the people.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof where to live and deal with that children attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who have no one left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a school sewing, has built two houses and, in collaboration with the organization of u.s. health PSI, has achieved many of the inhabitants of the village have had an HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not something obvious, since, in spite of the patent who is this disease all over the country, it is not generally speak openly about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Something strange in a country in which the king has officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch, Black Africa, the king Mswati III, is known for its opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy in place of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This way of life is not officially accepted is in large part responsible for the spread so fast that it has experienced the HIV virus in the last few decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other and you carry it wherever they go.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are rarely used.</seg>
<seg id="78">Is another culture, here only accept the contact skin against skin".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To promote the cultural exchange, the choir Imbongi travels every two or three years ago by the south African singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs, many in the most southern tip of the african continent still reminiscent of the apartheid era.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of whites, who sing songs in a language that is black; both recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and a lot of joy, but also has managed to rip off a couple of tears to some other soldier border rabid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey takes them forever to Esitjeni, where the singers visit to the sponsored children.</seg>
<seg id="82">Despite the fact that this small town just appear on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very well known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Come to Esitjeni, there shines a light," says the people of the place.</seg>
<seg id="84">And go after the 8.733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of the street Bergheimer full of singers marking the way, one realizes that it is also possible to see your light shine from there.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">NASA, the american space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there are also ice water, as is clear from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".</seg>
<seg id="6">The probe Messenger would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has formed a layer of ice.</seg>
<seg id="7">It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters in thickness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water comes presumably kite or, with great probability, asteroid that crashed against Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">No one relates the discovery of ice with the possibility that life exists on the planet, says the chief researcher of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the findings could help clarify how they have reached the water and other components of the life to other areas of the solar system.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This region of star formation, so-called form little bit romantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located to several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided in three), as a dark lanes of dust divide the hot heart of this area of star formation in three lobes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the constellation of Ophiuchus, the astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a fluke cosmic: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of the two galaxies in the process of merger will pounce the one to the other to finish crashing irreparably.</seg>

<seg id="50">Our window to the universe: the major telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes has not stopped growing and images that we provide are becoming more depth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">His mirror, the image, had a diameter of five metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA. UU., it raises the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - just the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in south Africa is segmented to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Despite this, reaches a diameter of approximately eleven metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">The drawback of this most economical building is that the telescope has an elevation angle fixed, so that their mobility is limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas also has an elevation angle fixed.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite having a diameter of mirror comparatively small, such capacity is comparable to that of the telescope mirror largest in the world.</seg>

<seg id="72">Until 2018 is not expected to be able to take pictures.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">These include two mirrors, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Keck telescopes are part of the Observatory on Mauna Kea, that together with them explore the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of mirror thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is a picture of how it would be.</seg>

<seg id="83">The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="86">The researchers are based on the assumption that in the south pole of Mercury there are also ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there are no hard evidence, since the probe Messenger revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">For decades the measurements of radar point to the existence of ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, the scientists now have the certainty that it is so.</seg>

<seg id="5">In the south of Azerbaijan many people manage to achieve ages biblical.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity.</seg>
<seg id="7">A search of traces in a country in which the people of 97 years old are still considered young.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The minibus is advancing with great clattering through the winding road that passes by the side of wooded hills, rivers of great wealth and of the simple houses of the local farmers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is located in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However, we find in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here to the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here live the "talyshi", a village in which not much is known, apart from that perfectly mastered the Persian and azeri and they are very long-lived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Our final destination is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">This small town boasts an architecture maybe too solid designed in the soviet era and that doesn't seem to fit at all in a mountainous landscape so picturesque.</seg>
<seg id="15">European tourists just come to this place, because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, it is too heavy.</seg>
<seg id="16">To explore the 323 kilometers from both urban cores, you need eight hours because the road is one-way.</seg>
<seg id="17">The amazing wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to the oil of the Caspian sea yet has not reached this innermost region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became famous in may on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision song contest and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the older people of the world", says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here is documented the lives of eight dozens of talyshis of the place that you have exceeded the 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Her son died at the age of 136 years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of the sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, there is no birth certificate that certifies.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if we take into account that the man older documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time to conceive of a daughter at the age of 136 years.</seg>
<seg id="29">What has been wrong then Şirali Müslümov in your age in a couple of decades?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live people of very old age," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age, especially when there is no civil registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">All the days glasses filled with melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is a fact that, surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants of the region located around Lerik tend to achieve a biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">At present there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why do they live here, in the south, so many people of advanced age?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The tour guide azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director of the museum, la Sra. Fatulayeva, believes however that the cause lies in the power supply.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that it is precisely the food rich in calories talyshi, who love the meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drinking a daily glass of melted butter, to be so healthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or maybe it is the way of life natural that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">Its 97 years is relatively young for what it is customary for these latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sitting on the floor, move a relentless a huge tub of butter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live under one roof, among them one of the sons and a daughter Mirzayeva, both became grandparents for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also bouncing from one side to the other two young children.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen prepare tea for the guests, a tea that is served in a few glasses typical shaped domed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blond hair that your child discovers us proud.</seg>
<seg id="48">I've always wash the hair with milk, that's why I was never has fallen and has maintained its color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Nor I have never used a"shampoo", says Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The pension is enough to live</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Has always eaten only so that it produced on their own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">In all my life I've never been to make the purchase at a supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then it tells us of her husband, who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">The worst was the time after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, everything returned to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">This type of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in Azerbaijan, the cult that is professed to be the father figure of the nation, who heads his country as a dictator, knows no limits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">It remained in power until 2003, at which time you gave witness to his son Ilham.</seg>
<seg id="59">At least the older people of Azerbaijan do not know what is poverty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva cobra 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) in respect of the monthly pension, an amount that you can live well taking into account the situation here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And perhaps the gray-haired son of Mirzayeva have reason: "in our culture elders are highly respected".</seg>
<seg id="62">Living in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">As if this weren't reason enough to stay alive many years...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the Constitution lack the expression "Human Rights"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The revolution has returned to Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrations that are competing in Cairo highlight the tremendous division that has gripped the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The future constitution, with sharia law as the basis, it is very controversial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The egyptian president spared no pathos.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We must overcome the transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">And that happens is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on public television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was directed to all the people, especially the coptic christians, liberals, the muslims illustrated and the secular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">All of them, sunk without remedy until now a confusing opposition, they are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile, by the grace of the powerful muslim community.</seg>
<seg id="11">As explained by Mohammed Mursi, almost begging for forgiveness, he has had to cancel temporarily the powers of the Constitutional Court and to expand his own, "in order to save the revolution".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, neither the egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this engineer 61-year-old with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California wants to save really.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Do you intend to deprive you of your power to the judiciary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members, predominantly islamists in a meeting night of 15 hours, and are truly disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, in the draft also says that the case-law is based on the "principles of islamic law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, what does that mean "the beginning"?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that the islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of maneuver of the legal brings, to impose a strict interpretation of sharia law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is, at least, suggests a new article added: in all matters relating to the sharia, it is mandatory to consult the University Al-Ashar, the institution's most important islamic country with a great power in all of islam, sunni.</seg>
<seg id="19">It doesn't have to be this way, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A large part of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What is also problematic is that it aims to maintain the military jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts were used to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.</seg>
<seg id="24">As set out in the draft, the State has to protect "the true essence of the egyptian family," and "promote your morals and values".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is a formulation so vague in legal terms that with the help of this article the state institutions could even control the content of the film and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Speaking of course it is not about anything other than censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">By the way that any article explicitly set the equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">In currency other prohibited to offend or defaming the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, it is not clear what is an offense and how it has to be sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="30">Equally questionable is the formulation that prohibits the "offense to the people"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">What is enough a caricature of the president or a joke on a lawyer?</seg>
<seg id="32">Matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution has become"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir square of the Cairo and vowed to derail the Act before it can enter into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution has returned and we'll end up winning," he says Hamdin Sabbahi, which occupies the third place in the lists for the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace prize and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft of the constitution should be "in the dustbin of history."</seg>
<seg id="38">Through Twitter accused followers of Mursi want to lead a "coup against democracy".</seg>
<seg id="39">"When convening the referendum, we will go to his palace and derrocaremos," says the opposition Jasser Said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We are still not tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been cleansed", is quoted in the egyptian media to opposition political Chaled Ali.</seg>
<seg id="41">And several judges announced that they didn't want to monitor the referendum, so that it would not be considered valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For its part, the muslim community well organized and made an appeal to hold a demonstration; for if not in Tahrir square, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the salafistas took part in it, to the cry of: "the people requires the application of the divine law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They demanded to Mursi "to clean up the country", at the same time proclaiming: "the Koran is our constitution."</seg>
<seg id="46">A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir square, where it all started, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is evident that the supporters of Mursi did not want to take the risk that something like this happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The muslim brotherhood claimed that both those who are opposed to the draft of the constitution as the supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now would come the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction it should follow the country.</seg>
<seg id="50">In this sense, it seems that the draft of the islamists has guaranteed the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced which in reality should have lasted until February and have included all the social forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">This lawyer 48 years specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial for the dictatorship of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="54">Not because they agree with their ideology, but because for him, the Human Rights are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">For this reason he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="56">"And now the term `Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution", he laments, in conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".</seg>
<seg id="57">The extension of the powers of Mursi of the three powers of the State made that this attorney is resignara.</seg>
<seg id="58">The measures taken are blatant violations of the rules of the democratic game, and be carried to Egypt to a new dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening the civil society, which has made the president is to abolish it," he laments Saeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, democracy can not function without the civil society organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.</seg>
<seg id="62">This could turn against it.</seg>
<seg id="63">A protester in Tahrir square warns: "you are designing a monster that you can not control".</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five billion people of Norway have one of the highest levels of life, not only of Europe but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is it possible that the success of the country to save some relationship with their greed for a fish extremely smelly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a series of cheeses excessively cured.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place them in the middle of a mountain of clothes football dirty and wet.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave it there for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can then smell the crippling aroma of rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is snowing. The scenery is spectacular and that smell, always present, floating in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rakfisk is trout in salting that is allowed to ferment in water, depending on what smelly that you would prefer, up to a year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To the extent that darkens and becomes more and more cold, the Norwegian flock to a festival which is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to the delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Is eaten raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit of a drink", says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the "General Rakfisk", which is in charge of organizing the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On all sides we see people eating this fish that are kept in small cubes and sipping a drink large quantities of the drink.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people like it more aquavit that the rakfisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink may kill the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I try a few pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid passing near the nose, is not evil; it is not very different to a portion of sushi that you travel a few kilometres in bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk is a product that comes from an era very different, in that the poverty beaten Norway and in which, before the existence of cooling, the fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in barrels airtight.</seg>
<seg id="19">Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well-fermented, is taken out and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, eat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Just a generation, thousands of norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.</seg>
<seg id="22">A stream of citizens of Sweden, the old rival and even a not too much richer than Norway, come to this country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, although quite smelly, the last of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is located between the dishes more expensive that you can buy.</seg>
<seg id="25">But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer or a sandwich't cost you a whopping 10 euros ($14) each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and the majority of norwegians like that so be it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here the people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Russian Grain, the racist extreme right-that shot down shot and killed 77 people, among which there were men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, refer to the shooting as "the event of the 22 of July".</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegian they have a really hard to believe that in its peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After a lot of the current wealth of Norway is the growth since the beginning of the 70's, one of the industries of oil-and gas-largest in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason why the us is going so well," says Anna, our waitress, while moving trays rakfisk and that, with her long hair blonde and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of the well-being Norwegian.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We are, as you say, people cautious."</seg>
<seg id="33">Their English, as the majority of people in this country, is impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We don't like to brag, we do not like the ostentation."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; all, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">While all the world wasted money that I had during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed properly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"While we can ski in the winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And eat rakfisk", he adds with a bold laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I'm in the snow queuing for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now a burger moose is certainly something different, and quite delicious to taste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But at night, it returns that smelly fish.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel that I stay is one of the many local held a dinner rakfisk in which diners can vote for the best fish, or maybe the more tests the nostrils.</seg>
<seg id="43">A television connected live with a host that takes a bow-tie, and it is surrounded by dishes of rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">It looks like the Eurovision contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What are your ratings for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here is our score, Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There is laughter and applause.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls off the chair, perhaps overcome by aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or perhaps the vapors of all of that fish.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you will remember with fondness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Its residents attributed to the merit of the growth of tourism in the area and of the construction of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">To reach the town, you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr. Pena Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the roads cracked and full of potholes that were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="17">You can also see plate with your name at the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about the climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We are confident that he can make real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera-Hernandez, deputy from the party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"Particularly, in regard to security and the economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After a continuous period of 81 years in power, the PRI was driven by Vicente Fox in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="21">The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years out of the presidential palace of The Pine trees, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also rejects the qualification that the opposition makes a lack of essence of the new president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"He is a man very sincere, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a fantastic man of state and, above all, is a person who knows how to listen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">However, the other side of the state that is not the impression you have a lot of people about your former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under stretches of motorway high is, in many ways, a suburb of the City of Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier this year called for the intervention of the military to assist in the struggle against the bands of drugs that operate in the neighborhoods and the violence against women is particularly severe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On a plot desert, located next to a garbage dump, have been left abandoned in just the last two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, sadly famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say, in the best of cases, which failed to address the problem of femicide while he was in office.</seg>
<seg id="33">The more critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a house made of concrete, typical of deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to hold back tears while showing me pictures of his daughter died, Mariana Moon.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of the facts, Mariana is committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, his family believe that his partner was killed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I got to their house, it seemed as if they had cleaned the body," recalls mrs Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">"There were signs that he had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observed from the walls, along with a cross that reads a single word: Justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, that is exactly what the family says that he has been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"The authorities of the state have treated me as if it were an old gossip, a strong drink is raging, a complainer.</seg>
<seg id="42">What they want is that one simply accept what they say and that street."</seg>
<seg id="43">"But that may not be so when there have been so many irregularities and much negligence," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The presidential sash that the President Pena Nieto will receive the Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico during the last six years, and the new president has pledged to give priority during his tenure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope it's the same kind of president that was when I was the governor", says the deputy of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, this is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza more fear.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Bradley Manning not denounced ill-treatment, according to claim the tax</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Prosecutors try to deal with complaints of abuse of Bradley Manning during their stay in prison</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The trial focuses on the period of Manning in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defense wants the court should dismiss the case on the basis that the imprisonment of Manning was severe</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Prosecutors tried to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost opportunities of denouncing the ill-treatment he now claims that he suffered while he was under detention by the military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">During the interrogation to the prosecutor's office conducted to Manning on a preview of the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said that the registrations of the weekly visits from officers of the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaint regarding the treatment he received.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interrogation, which was conducted during a hearing held following the request of the defense of that desestimara the case since his incarceration had been hard and that it had already course punishment enough, came a day after that Manning had testified that he had thought about suicide while in detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The analyst of army intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has not confirmed that never Manning outside source of information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the view of the Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the official rellenaban after visits to Manning during his arrest at the military prison at Quantico, where he was imprisoned in the regime of maximum seclusion from July 2010 to April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The official would have been carried out questions to Manning and recorded their responses.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that had qualified for the treatment that they gave the guards as "excellent" and received treatment in the facilities in general as "very professional".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms do not show any allegation of ill-treatment, despite the fact that the officers asked Manning directly on the treatment he received, he said Fein.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning said that he had expressed their concern on some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken these problems, and we had indicated that it would try, but that they did not leave a record of these issues in the registry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"They wrote 'without incident' (after having spoken of the problems), but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," Manning said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, he also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment they received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the intentions of suicide that had been expressed in a form months before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning said that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the regime of "prevention of injury" under which it was.</seg>
<seg id="20">The military said that it had been placed under such a restrictive regime, which is one grade below the surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and the safety of other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted the state to greater know that I was well and (I wanted) to cease to be under the prevention of injuries... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, it is a better quality of life," Manning said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq, and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the base of the marine corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July of 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait, and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said that the fact that they are not allowed to know what was going on or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world was reduced only to the Camp Arafjon, to that cage," said Manning on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I thought I was going to die in that cage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning said that so you will only be allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He explained that he tried to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he slept.</seg>
<seg id="31">He said that if the guards could not see her face when he was around for the night, I woke to return to go back to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Manning's lawyer introduced in January 2011 a formal complaint about the treatment you received Manning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On Friday, the judge asked Manning on an allegation that had been carried out in Thursday's statement, according to which, after being forced a night to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he was forced for a recount in the morning to stand desdnudo in front of the guards and other inmates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to be covered with the blanket during the count.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the interrogation the judge on Friday, Manning said that he inferred by the order that gave the warden that he should drop the blanket with which could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let her fall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked on the previous night because of an attempt to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning said he had told the officer that you could have used the elastic of her panties or your flip-flops for self-harm, but that had not done so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Manning testified that that evening had been removed from his cell to his underwear, his flip-flops and his glasses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Their lawyers have the hope that the judge has at least into account the experiences he went through during his stay in prison and to reduce drastically its judgment in case it was condemned at the council of war, which is planned to start at the beginning of the next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense said that he plans to do that Manning will plead guilty to minor offences and defending other accusations considered too extreme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">It is planned that the view will resume this weekend and it is expected that the tax argumenten that the conditions of detention were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held according to the rules of application to any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, cause of illegally publishing information on the Internet, filtering of information of the national defense and theft of property or public records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="1">My identity crisis mexican-american</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to criticize those who were; he says that remind the mexican those difficult times</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that mexican-americans find themselves caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico City, had only just gone down to the esplanade and come to the area of processing of immigration and as I was totally confused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Some posters showed the way to two queues: one for "Mexican" and another for "Foreign".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where it should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having grown up in Central California, during my whole life I have been called "mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is shorthand ethnic, in the same way that my friends from Boston refer to themselves as "irish" or my friends from New York qualify themselves "Italian".</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided to do a "mexican-american".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was just american.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle during an interview in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I don't have the level of vocabulary from a native speaker and I can't get rid of my american accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my american passport and I got in the queue of foreigners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought at that moment this week in which the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the agenda of the day, as long as they meet the leaders of these two countries, consisted of: immigration, drugs, and commerce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was looking forward to also talk about the growth of the mexican economy, one of the reasons that in these moments it is as likely that a mexican stay in Mexico as you venture out to go to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wants to associate with the United States and Canada and to create in north America, a trade bloc in the style of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Pena Nieto promised to continue the fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Probably the majority of americans will never agree to that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to give up half of its territory at the point of a gun.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for the mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind us of are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So, in the moment in which an official of the United States says any thing that involves the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the elite mexican, about how americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children of Moctezuma was put on a war footing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And even so, for Mexico, the relationship that really represents a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million of mexican-americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do we speak of a grudge?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to which the country provides opportunities and other for that is not so.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why there are so many people of mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio is that, at some point of our family tree, there was one person, the father or mother or one of the grandparents, to which he closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and he had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And most of the times that person to fit a particular profile: dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants and to them we are loyal.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mexico is not.</seg>
<seg id="35">And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the american dream, to have gone to a good school and have had good jobs, we can't lose sight of what we are experiencing is that, the american dream, and not the mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty yes it is.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is for the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that many of the mexican belonging to the elite of the ruling class not I liked it.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over his shoulder as if we were in a category lower than that is not enough to mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families would not have failed in Mexico, had not gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And now we would find ourselves trapped behind this curtain of silk, living well in the United States but, even so, as lonely souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when I was a child, I remember that there is this friction between the mexicans and mexican-americans because the first to know with more strength who they are and the second this bothers them.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Meanwhile, many mexican-americans that I know they feel that they are part of either of the two.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love to listen to the mexican group Tigers of the North, but also to Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">You have the best of each country, but you're not rooted to any of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, they see us as americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we are considered to be mexican.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, to further complicate things, by what I have learned during my trip, some mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to re-connect with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">Want that mexican-americans to work as "ambassadors" of Mexico improvised, representing their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We would say to our fellow americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and please press the political leaders to reinforcing their ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course...</seg>
<seg id="56">That's not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is too much resentment.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, with wage inequality, the rampant corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not so sure that is a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I am afraid that you will be left alone with this idea, friends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico for a century and a half, then they have to accept the fact that some mexican-americans are still resentful for how he treated his family makes a lot less time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are more "mexican" than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a basis unlikely to peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">How can there be any day a lasting peace between arabs and jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the middle of the useless, and regular discussions about who started it first, dozens of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 palestinians, most of them civilians, and six israelis have been killed, and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the city of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But, despite the fact that the israelis and the palestinians seem to be stuck in your old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The arab spring has left all dashed to pieces like it or not, palestinians and israelis have been caught up in the hoopla regional.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will make your struggle is even more bloody than before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that their lethal situation of stalemate could desencallarse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that neither loses nor gains</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the optimism seems to currently very difficult to justify.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if you keep the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in spite of having killed some of their leaders, and put pressure to the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the corners more miserable and populated the planet, Israel has not been able to end up with Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West bank, the other part of Palestine is currently governed by their bitter rivals Fatah, the palestinian faction more moderate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, the leaders of Hamas may come to the conclusion that the weather plays in your favor.</seg>
<seg id="17">Given that the islamists have been gaining influence of the arab world, Hamas has made friendships rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the muslim ally closer to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Also what has made Qatar, one of america's most rich and dynamic of the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The exultant members of Hamas say that the half-moon islamist is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where it dominates the party-militia Hezbollah, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly islamist could overthrow Bashar Assad, until you get to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas are threatening the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the muslim brotherhood, led by the President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most fundamental of the arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the despot layman who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, not had too much time to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas's emergence as a main character that can not be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the wing hard-Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">In what refers to the military issue, you have placed Hamas on your site.</seg>
<seg id="26">The anti-missile system Dome of Iron of Israel has proved its effectiveness and many of the missiles of Hamas have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The israelis will sleep more peacefully... for some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">In terms of the diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever; many european countries also blamed Hamas have started the latest wave of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">First of all, Israel has flourished. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister that has largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets fired from Gaza have finished with the life of about 30 israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier, which erodes the West bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protect the jewish settlements that continue to rise despite the fact that, according to international law, are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud has joined a group of a line even tougher led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period prior to the elections on the 22nd of January, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why pamper those twisted palestinians, giving them a state of their own?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you really rule in the West bank, do not shoot rockets as they have made their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to have them after that wall and give a good blow if they raise the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the imposition wing hard, although the arab spring could alter their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the islamists to take power in Egypt and in other sites do not have much appreciation to Israel, its priority will be to address the internal difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense budget of Israel is higher than that of its four arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a war with the superpower of the area hardly will help the new arab governments to improve their economies.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the cease-fire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also the israelis should think long-term.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive the palestinians of their right to self-determination involves creating a powder keg that a day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repression is already undermining democracy in the jewish state and the demography worsens the situation as it increases the arab population.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a toll diplomatic growing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a push of outsiders to the conflict.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The solution is still the predicate sensible people of both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">The hope, small short term, is that the cease-fire to give a little more momentum to the people outside who are fighting for this cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which should start to curb the inflow of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is located in an unprecedented situation to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and Jerusalem shared.</seg>
<seg id="48">The arab unrelated to the subject matter should also push Hamas and Fatah to join.</seg>
<seg id="49">That would contribute more to the creation of a palestinian state that the imminent attempt to get a category of virtual state at the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">The law of generic packaging of tobacco enters into force in Australia</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases look on cigarette packs a off green color, which are the same for all brands of tobacco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The australian law on tobacco and packaging generic, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaced the logos and colors of the marks by a wrap-off, olive green, a horrific images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and sick babies to be children of smoking parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a font type small.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the stricter regime of the world applied to the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia states that the purpose is to discourage young people from smoking by the removal of the traits that make this habit has glamour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trust in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance of never do it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"You can see that children, even from a very early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand", stated the minister of Health federal, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how the girls related to the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Despite the fact that Australia has one of the fastest-smoking rooms lowest in the world, and that these changes will not affect too much of the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argued that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco, in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring the counterfeiters China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other people say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Has, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said that the demand of pitilleras and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the packs had been fired from almost zero to two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Sra. Has stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units establishments wholesalers and I was hoping for more stocks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"For us it is a good business."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networking among the demographic sector addressed in the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of australian laws that prohibit advertising in television and sponsorship of sports and force the majority of sellers not to put the cigarette to the view, the marketing of tobacco has gone to be made online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned the Internet advertising companies and local websites, but you can't restrict it in foreign pages.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If comercializas tobacco and so you just have this little window to promote your products, the online space is the place the more compelling in that area," said Becky Freeman, a researcher of public health of the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman was an increase of reviews about brands from "ordinary citizens" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">I wonder if this is just a private citizen who really loves cigarettes Marlboro and has taken the trouble to make a video, or if any firm marketing is behind all of this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on what that implies the new regulation in the marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has come even to pay to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen the new standards; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that is restricting the trade unfairly, despite the fact that none of these countries has a volume of significant trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is likely that the WTO issued a resolution to mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws in the field of packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the year 2001, Canada became the first country that introduced the obligation to include pictures on cigarette packs.</seg>
<seg id="29"> There are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Great Britain, New Zealand, south Africa and India are considering applying for tougher laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In Australia, many smokers are shown challenging.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The photographs do not affect me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just don't do case".</seg>
<seg id="34">"You picked up the cigar and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while purchasing a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Honestly, there is only one reason why you would stop smoking: by my daughter."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, manager of the tight King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, indicates that packs uniforms make it more complicated to put them on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Usually it takes one hour in desenvalar a delivery; now it takes me four," says Yu.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government should have completely banned the tobacco and then, already, it is worth it, it's finished and we closed the store," he says as you lift your hands up.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world constantly linked, is not so bad to get bored a little</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the celebrations of the day of thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane flying suffered a mechanical problem and had to wait until he got another plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I'm not going to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Spend half a day in an airport waiting for you to get a flight is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But there are more and more academics and experts in child development praising the benefits of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">According to them, it is well that we and our children, we bore you from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bored forces the brain to find exciting options and it may be that fosters creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Given that, currently, most of us are connected to this or to that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So, what we should accept in good spirits boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And not.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, as we will discuss this later.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the first place, like many people, supposed to be, now that we have more time for leisure, the boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, as he says Peter Toohey, professor of ancient Greek and roman History from the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, the history of the boredom is very extensive," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on the boredom dating back to the I century d.C.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We must also ask ourselves how we define the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways," said John D. Eastwood, a professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After reviewing published research and come up with the idea before a discussion group formed by 100 people, the Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of "want, but not able to participate in an activity that fills you".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does something, but want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="22">He points out that with apathy, there is no desire to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom may sound awfully similar to the depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the Professor Eastwood says that, even though they may be related, the people who are bored tend to see the problem as a question of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed they consider that the problem you have them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we believe that we are bored, when what we really happens is that we have problems to concentrate on.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were submitted to a previous experiment in which the participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article in a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard in the adjoining room a television program on all volume that does not kept any relationship, others listened with the volume low, so that it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The group that heard the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why, and attributed it to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"When you try to concentrate on a task difficult or interesting, the alteration of care can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, as to detect defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music to distract you can help you to not get bored".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"In fact, we now know that move or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to combat it, as they make that person is physically more alert."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The research shows that those children that allows them to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be quiet," says the Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all know what that is bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a speaker monotonous, a movie especially boring.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people have a greater tendency to get bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 80's a "scale of tendency to boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes questions such as "many of the things that I do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do it all".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, by using these scales, the researchers have discovered that the boys have a greater tendency to get bored more often than girls, and in particular need more external stimulation and more varied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that is bored quite easily.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human Development and community of the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in contact with 400 children and with their parents between seven and eight times a day by using a search.</seg>
<seg id="41">He discovered that 32 percent of teens said that she was bored while I was in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said that she was bored when I was not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents say that it became boring for her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Professor Larson said that he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he said that what I did know was that "adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its highest levels", in large part because both the children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, back to my original question: is it good to get bored?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes it's not, because that, carried to the extreme, you can do that we expose to physical risks absurd, how to make bets or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as evidenced by the research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between the boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is the way that the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of Psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you watch the television, it is possible that you will meet in the short term, but not long-term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">"So, if your child is bored and give an iPad, it may no longer be bored, but there will be learned to relax by yourself or dosed", says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "that ability to be selected is applied to other situations", he notes.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child will not only learn to entertain themselves by itself, but you learn to be better controlled in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that we really want to praise the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we should also not be too critical of him.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our objective should be, rather, to feel comfortable paragraphs of the constant hum of the activities and technologies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The professor Eastwood agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"In our view, we need to get bored any more, but the boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing as to relate it to something that is worth it", he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">Points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a time-out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the sound stops".</seg>

<seg id="1">Colorado: no book of instructions to the new law on the consumption of marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, a 19 year old student at an institute for community and as a player in southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be the law of the state: the possession of a few stones of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Orozco says that a day of September, he and some friends were driving by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when stopped by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences that carry each one a fine of us $ 100) in which you will be informed of the trial date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They treat us like criminals", says Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And what are they?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of lesser causes for possession of drugs is less dependent on the law of the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are negating both here and in the state of Washington, where he passed a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police departments have left to bring charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, which shall be approved legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the prosecutors of the districts most conservative of Colorado have committed to move forward with the open cases for possession of marijuana and are still citing people.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, a number of cities, from the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains to the west, are voting to block the opening marijuana shops, authorized recently, in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be the next", said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just to the east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also mulling the issue.</seg>
<seg id="14">And still looking for advice to establish a system of licensing of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all of it before you reach the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado is ahead of the majority of states in regard to the regulation of the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Commission of alcohol control of the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what could work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is No real precedent that would serve as a model," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The law of Washington, called R-502, enters into force on 6 December, which leaves also a year during which you swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, there are some issues mechanical delicate to be solved during that period, as the way to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to offer an "appropriate access" to marijuana authorized, and the prohibition of carrying on business of cannabis in a radius less than 300 metres away from schools, parks, playgrounds, child or child centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"In no place is more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorized than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for cannabis legal, a research group recently created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, sent an email to its police officers in which they informed that the prosecutor of the city would bring legal proceedings for minor offenses for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 years, and that the police would file charges against those crimes, "with immediate effect".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The chief of police Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the regulations of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue traffickers and drug dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld county or, in the north of Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his office would continue pursuing the cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on the consumer and that they will decide to receive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently, 119 persons are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has the obligation to bring legal proceedings against those faults that at the time in which they took place were a criminal offence," said Mr. Buck in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Table, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police of Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appointment to adults for possession of small amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">Pete Hautzinger, county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not think that you are wasting your time to continue enforcing the law until this change," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55 percent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judicial system were to be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">The conflicting reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence between the officials with respect to the great experiment ecologist in this state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"It is a cultural barrier with prosecutors from the district," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused for possession of marijuana, and that is a spokesperson for the local National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have spent so much time taking people to court, which, in reality, they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">To be the first states to consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at the national level in regard to the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal, sales also looking forward to receive indications from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal offence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope of the Department of justice to give in.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the fact that there have been some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed most of that there are the business of selling marijuana with these purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 more states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"Although it is likely that drug agents do not throw doors down to confiscate a bag of dope small, probably appear reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of drug policy of the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities of Colorado does not expect to act the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them can be opened.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the western town of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and is likely to approve it for the next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation in which authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our community voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are looking for what you voted for the front community to vote in favor of what you voted for the state."</seg>
<seg id="47">Many questions arise in this regard.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't remember any time in my life that has not been dreaming of getting a place in the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had been in the which I supposed was the best place in the world to learn, a symposium of the Greek contemporary era which fostered the two pillars of civilization: the free-thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, two weeks take my place in the Worcester College at the end of the 80s to pursue a degree in History, had already made the room, which triggered the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed and began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper The Evening Standard said that I had abandoned them because he did not allow some fellow of the university keeping sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I was gone because I'm being forced to drink cups chipped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less fun.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away from there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran away, because it had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my extravagant name, nor to the fact that it came from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I harassed by a sole reason, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbarian: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the conservative party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You may ask to what comes of that now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students of the centre-right is suffering a similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The hatred institutionalized and growing towards the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equality of rights of homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of students of grade) of Corpus Christi College assert that they are "often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as not welcome" for their political ideas.</seg>
<seg id="19">Want to create a position on the committee of equal opportunities of your college to be sure of being able to express their opinions freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">His situation was not helped by a recent documentary of the BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The paradise: young, bright, and right-wing) on the policy of the students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a suit case and a cane with a silver grip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, students conservatives say that you treat them as "scapegoats" for the introduction of tuition fees higher.</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, said in a newspaper Sunday that "there is a growing trend of left-wing in the universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club no not even know."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and a student of history in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill of 19 years and president-elect of the OUCA, says that the attitude of the members of the JCR to the people that are the centre-right has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This is a threat for the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I entered the university in September 1986, was a young man of 18 years terribly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to Margaret Thatcher, former student, a degree "honoris causa" after the cuts in funding of Higher Education.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have done shudder of fear of any stalinist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university, when the new students to know each other and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that was waiting for me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that the professors not only made a blind eye to the mockery that was made from the university conservatives, but that participated in it willingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The policy of the miners ' strike, the privatization and the opposition of the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in south Africa came to the meeting of the wood of the seminar.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first one that I attended were to translate the English-French texts of the EIGHTEENTH century and I was not prepared for what came next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said the professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't even one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt, a shortish man with a face that seemed mass of cake, I knew well how to eject bad bile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"What is that thatcheristas refuse to learn French, or is that, quite simply, they are fools?", asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students laughed.</seg>
<seg id="41">I burned the eyes of the tears she was trying to contain.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you go to French lessons in their free time, as long as you are not too busy getting to know people," growled Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to my room like a banshee.</seg>
<seg id="44">That night I sat alone at the time of the dinner in the university; then I felt a light pat on the back.</seg>
<seg id="45">Was a student of English second year called James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," I said kindly.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I am afraid that is the way it's going.</seg>
<seg id="48">Get with anyone who is suspected of being a Tory.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is very complicated, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse.</seg>
<seg id="50">Many Tories newcomers appear to be labour".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in a local pub, I tried to cowardly to hide.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I didn't agree with everything he said the Sra. Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">That trick was useless.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first year student of Philosophy, Political Economy and that, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "you Are the daughter of a fascist pig.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contaminated".</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students took that little song.</seg>
<seg id="57">I became the dirty perverted.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How do you have sex Tories?", asked one.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Will give a beating to one another, do you not?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt the same way that they should have felt homosexuals before the law liberal of the 60s.</seg>
<seg id="61">How could one day lead a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">What I would be forced to stay with people who thought like I just after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">What would that make me labour and suppress my natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years I waited to be presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined to my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">Hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also advisor of Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">I was just barely there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place that he considered country and insignificant, and for its adherence to the marxist view-deterministic of the story.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you're not going to be happy," I said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to move daily from Oxford to my parents ' house in London, finding refuge in my friends and family-minded metropolitan more open.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">Don't believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">When he was studying there in the 40's, is accepted by all political points of view.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But if it is the best place in the world," he said with sadness.</seg>
<seg id="76">"They would never do that, not there between my dear needles dream.</seg>
<seg id="77">Until my friends communists have always had an attitude impeccable."</seg>
<seg id="78">His sore eyes began to blur.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Give him another chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I'm sure you have done it just to tease.</seg>
<seg id="81">I'd break your heart if you leave."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Depleted of many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend of mine, who also was a supporter of the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and he had given up his creed.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week, during a seminar on the other a professor of History had hinted at, talking about totally serious, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Red shame on the inside, admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" and I called them "old stupid".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The truce did not last long.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="88">By that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the newspapers of Murdoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked with a key.</seg>
<seg id="90">I was curled up in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors opting out.</seg>
<seg id="91">When you were did the suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">Never went back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">Maybe I you call it weak moaning.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only has trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party but which, today, is in hiding after a reputation deserved nothing of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The model argentina Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his floor.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were twenty people, among which were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.</seg>
<seg id="21">In every detail of the floor, the decorations, the food, the music, everything looked and felt his spirit.</seg>
<seg id="22">"To each one of the guests made us feel important and loved", recalls the "top model", which started to work with him during the Week of Haute Couture of Paris, in 1995.</seg>

<seg id="26">He loves people with good education and better titles, and they will love him.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous gateway sixty metres long proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and should parading through the gateway to contemplate a "hearing" of dream that looks masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that you chose Jackie Kennedy for your wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool coat and skin that once belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."</seg>
<seg id="31">I remember it perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest, "gillette", and a jacket of the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was a gift that I did it," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I prefer him above others for their femininity, for his great love to the women, because it enhances our beauty," adds the former duchess of Fair.</seg>
<seg id="35">I really like the colors you use, have great light and are "donors" of the face.</seg>
<seg id="36">The proportions are perfect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The princess and prescriber of fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time I wore a Valentino.</seg>
<seg id="38">When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of to get the old and the chance to be able to use one of his suits night...</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally the time came at the end of the 90s.</seg>
<seg id="40">I bought my first dress Valentino for use at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was a red suit, with skirt blown up, "corsage" draped neckline and word of honor.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explained the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="44">The princess D Arenberg saves your party dresses of the designer with "the maximum care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that entails."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The "king" of the fashion</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The grand final of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress Marie-Chantal Miller at his wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.</seg>

<seg id="48">According to the journalist, Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high fashion of the late TWENTIETH century, "the return of the customers of the high society".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Obnubilado for years with the "savoir-etre" of the elite, now Valentino is your best copy.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of rank highest in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates so many honours as any of the spouses of their clients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"I have always called attention to its refinement, its calm, its look neat and perfect", recognizes D Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner in the Museum of Orsay.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I was spotless, the time does not pass to him."</seg>

<seg id="1">The office of the world's toughest: human mules of Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros, the porters of the volcano indonesian play the life and health loading 70 kilograms of sulphur through steep stone paths</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their work is hell, and another that, literally, works in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living from removing sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">To do this, you have to get down every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur dioxide gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when in contact with the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After booting large rocks of sulfur, which in total they will weigh about 70 pounds, carries in two bamboo baskets that burden on your shoulders through steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">Are only 250 metres to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 metres of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend to a crawl, keeping the balance and measuring with an intelligent way to work your steps in order not to slip and fall by the edge of the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any setback could cost them their life, as happened to a French tourist who is traveling went off the road years ago by the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents per kilo of sulphur extracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once up, you open the way among the tourists that the shooting as if they were monkeys circus and, uploading gradually and painstakingly, the heavy baskets, walk three miles to the balance that a mining company has located a little further down, at 1850 metres of height.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company operating since 1960 the volcano and never better said, their workers, they pay 662 indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make, matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and up to whiten the sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As is normal load 70 kilos, we took a 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) in each trip", explains Anto, who usually make three ports daily.</seg>
<seg id="14">It takes three hours on each one and just ground, but allow you to put together 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though it seems like a misery for so inhuman effort, is three times what they would earn in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The wages of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is of two million rupees (167 eur) ", clarifies the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the resort island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the tagus river was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, it is as overwhelming as the sulphur: "I married a young man from Bali, where they are hindus, and I brought it to Java to convert to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, shortness of breath, cough constantly and you will irritate the eyes by the toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Its 27 years, Anto takes three played the role in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already started to pass bill despite covering your face with a mask and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">You have asthma, shortness of breath, cough constantly and you will irritate the eyes by the toxic gases that dismisses the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is the price to pay to get your sleep.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French", promises in English more than acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but rather that it is the work of a mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing an unclean wooden hut with other porters, get up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur non-stop stream of night, when its characteristic yellow color is blue and shining in the midst of the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Defy the shadows, Anto low to the crater alumbrándose with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he has purchased with his money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters loaded baskets of sulfur on his shoulders from the bottom of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In spite of its immense benefits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of sulfur to save costs or to provide any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and to both the weight.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charge for the camera, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros), the keepers of this natural park charge to the tourists that flock to photograph the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the cattle, and not for the people", protest Madrusin, a sturdy carrier of 42 years in the Kawah Ijen three decades, since he left the college.</seg>
<seg id="30">Capable of lifting up to 110 pounds, ensures that will hold working "all I can," because they need the money to educate their three children, between the ages of 18 and 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I'll retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulfur burning throat and smart eyes when the wind shifted suddenly and caught the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, are so hard that none complain of suffering from serious diseases... beyond, of course, his regular breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees, and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik because you can only load 50 kg to their 53-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his colleagues start to 15 tons of sulphur in the volcano, that three trucks moved to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 miles away by a way of goats among the weeds.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I'll retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life", proclaims Unainik opening mouth, where it's missing several teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of their five children, the oldest of 30 years, also works carrying sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but the misery perpetuated from generation to generation one of the crafts toughest in the world: the one that make the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.</seg>

<seg id="3">"The population of Singapore needs to grow".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am a husband patriotic, you're my wife patriotic, we do our civic duty, and we believe life!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It may seem far-fetched that these verses are part of an announcement of mints, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at the rate of birth of Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is home to the hope that with the announcement manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of the music for people to comply with "their national duty".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">Is the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in reproduce ourselves, so that we feel that this was an issue that had to be addressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried many things, like throwing perfumes with pheromones or arrange evenings speed dating (speed-dating).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily performed.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why don't we do the most creative possible to solve this problem, that is to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That don't take so lightly is the Singapore government.</seg>
<seg id="17">Spend US$1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A package of government for married couples and parents grants up to $ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and delivers tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all of this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city-State rich and high technology in southeast Asia, also known by the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time that he was above 2-known as the replacement rate - it was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why singaporeans do not have any more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">So Wei Ming, director of Policies of Marriage and the Family from the National Division of Population, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of their life goals and priorities, beyond marry and form a family," she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase of singleness, and to delay marriage and births, which gives as a result a decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy eu tip to dramatically increase immigration to cope with the decrease of the population has created resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are web sites where there is lots of xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, especially the chinese, the critical by keeping wages low and will not be integrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year the party of government of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the fees and charges higher for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the income tax, the cost of health care and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government tries not to build many small houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, has started to affect the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authority for urban development, has passed to control the number of small apartments, known as a "shoe box", which can be build in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there are concerns that they may promote a style of life of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large houses, and family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the company THE real estate Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" are sold much more quickly than the larger units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Are most popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted, days, even weeks, faster than the units of larger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">This makes it all that much better for our cash flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, admits that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, which before were put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too stressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-State.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Privacy.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private or "the scope of private life that has the right to protect it from any intrusion".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">What is private to a minor of 16 years?</seg>
<seg id="5">How do you apply this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks?</seg>
<seg id="6">Do you understand the dangers to which it is exposed by air on the Internet situations that surely he wouldn't share off-line?</seg>
<seg id="7">elPeriódico interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years, frequent users of the network.</seg>
<seg id="8">In four cases, associated with the term "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the key and user name", when applied to social networks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My deepest secrets not would go up to a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when you try to explain the meaning of the private sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where you have accounts from two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Are secret very, secrets, my mom can get to know them, but not all of the world," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On FB get nice pictures or games.</seg>
<seg id="12">I also dabble with my acquaintances.</seg>
<seg id="13">"He wouldn't share a photo that is not mine, or of someone who is doing the ridiculous," he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish photographs, obscene, of naked people, of crimes or write reviews humiliating or violent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge ensures meet the 35 friends you have on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of them are relatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">The mother is included, has the key of one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">I opened Twitter to express myself and write tweets interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I don't know if you respond to me, I only get", he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends so fast," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Do not hesitate to answer that would never accept a request from an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nor would make case to someone who will recommend you to a stranger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of Joseph, of 14 years, is different.</seg>
<seg id="24">The adolescent has open accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, in this last pets not know 20 people added to your friends list.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I'm not scared, because we have something in common, the music by example," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">According to the boy, not one has hinted nor has asked the home address or your phone number.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If I presionaran or I require simply out of my account," he acknowledges.</seg>
<seg id="28">Jose became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The boy are not beyond the experiences of what is known today as ciberbullying.</seg>
<seg id="30">An acquaintance of my friend were extorting in a social network.</seg>
<seg id="31">Being threatened and demanded money.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I never knew who he was," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The victim, according to Joseph, not closed the account.</seg>
<seg id="34">"You just put privacy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Then explains a series of steps to set up the account in a secure way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Unlike Jorge, this guy would go up photos of well-known in situations that are uncomfortable or embarrassing.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yes I would, if I get it wrong, or you've been wanting.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Although I know it is ciberbullying," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Key questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, considers that in order to target the children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social networking is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game", mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras notes that the academic Marc Prensky, master's degree in education from the University of Yale university and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with the technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are digital immigrants that we have to teach them, as we are still learning," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He says that the issue is complex, "because we're asking you to have a criteria defined above what it should be or not to distribute, publish or say to an age that maturity is not given for that."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also that they are selective when it matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences", he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make you think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them not to do it serves no purpose," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then, Batons lists some options: There are things that you don't contarías to a strange, why did you do on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, would you like to post a photo of it like that you posted of a friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the others post about it?</seg>
<seg id="52">When tags party photos, what you asked for permission to other people for tagging?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more, what everyone needs to know what you are doing every time?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to show them that they must act on line as they do off-line.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as it should be in the social networks," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Surveillance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Stuart Guard, university professor, teacher of primary school and educational consultant, says that it is essential for parents to read to consciousness the policies of the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">By understanding each of the items they have solid grounds for talking with their children about the implications of open an account on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, the age and what is permitted to share or publish," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to the Guard, it is key to remember the children the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the treaties and international courts," he added Pinera, and greeted him with a handshake Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The confirmation of both presidents that will be submitted to the ICJ happened then that Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota for the one who had agreed to submit to the failures of this international tribunal, then a decision on maritime boundary with Nicaragua that was considered gravely mistaken.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have an array triunfalista but should serve to expand our production matrix and a glimpse of a better future for our peoples," he added Humala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We have decided to favoring one group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and borders...uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said peruvian president in a message read.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Among those projects, mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it gave no further details.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underscored by the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">"South america should learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship, is a goal that "South america, in this case, yes, you should learn from Europe".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who took part in the VI Summit of the president of the Union of south american Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, said the state-run TV Peru that europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Defended, in that sense, the project to establish the south american citizenship that encourage the countries members of Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have to get the free mobility of citizens and workers for any south american country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still sectors reactionary that we want to return to the past", he warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The ecuadorian president was, in addition, in favour of the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the anglo-saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those who give chair will never agree to anything and, on the other hand, we the south american what we signed all.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of United States," he said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa said that it is regretted that decision, because this has not betrayed its principles, but has met its "deep democratic values and human rights".</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that, in his time, "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange he be extradited to a third country and is not respected its process".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He criticized, in addition, to the justice Swedish require you to submit in its territory to the interrogation by an alleged sexual offence when "the own Swedish legislation allows you to do this using video conferencing, which can be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and mental health of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken with him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that I had a small problem lung, nothing serious," said the representative of ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes there is the danger of damage to their physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to do exercises in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This complicates the health of any person," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto that will allow you to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of european and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closing of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not negotiate with human rights, that word is not used in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the authorities european legal because the attorney-Assange, Baltazar Garzon, is doing a series of procedures in different european bodies", he mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And opined that "if Britain da morning the laissez-passer this is just".</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as perfectly allows its legislation and as it has done in other cases, questions to the lord Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or questions via Skype tomorrow is just this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took the opportunity to assert himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and noted that which does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, that distort the freedom of expression".</seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press we are not politicians wicked and the evil but the evil journalists in function of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this respect, it welcomed the fact that you are not these journalists "or bankers or the hegemonic countries and bourgeois, which dominate in Ecuador", and said that to be re-elected "deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to hold the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until their next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and do not tolerate the opportunism and the golpismo coated legality" because in reality "shattered the legitimacy of the paraguayan democracy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The ecuadorian president considered, in addition, "perfectly relevant" the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate now with Nicaragua in the maritime limits between the two countries, following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the sovereignty maritime nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the moment do not abide by that ruling.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between a south american country and one in central america.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they should be overcome by the will to walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is to process them broadly to overcome them, and move on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also confided in a good conclusion of the dispute by maritime boundary which remain in the same court Peru and Chile, and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries agree to accept failure hard".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In reference to the eventuality that it is presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term of office pointed out that sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that if he loses the elections of February 2013 will retire from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Personally I never have been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be correct from the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My movement pólitico believed that it was I who ensured that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Winning would be my last term in the presidency and from there we went out of the public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is a decision," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also referred to the new treatment of health of venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I just spoke with the vice president of venezuela Nicolas Maduro and tells me that she traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which is expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It don't mean a relapse in the state of health of president Chavez," he said.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Deaths due to aids today are because of late detection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if I dropped a bomb", refers to recall the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to do "more suavecito", with no obvious success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy hid his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Decided to take charge only of his illness and he began to inquire about her; with such an endeavour that has already celebrated its birthday 43.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the patients oldest of the HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine in the early 90's, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, until the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut".</seg>
<seg id="9">Then, having aids was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignorant of their disease, even many people come when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" your immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At 31 years of the onset of aids in the world, at least of the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, it is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to this information was endorsed in April of this year in a scientific publication prestigious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infectologist and expert in HIV/aids, Andrade Villanueva said that from the year 2008, the scientists had concluded that aids was not a judgment fatal, but the year of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement of the immune system in patients when you start the diagnostics, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years of age, when reported 500 CD4 cells.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In simple words, this means that the one who receives the diagnosis of HIV-positive to 25 years of age, under these terms "while you stay in control you can live without problems until 75 years", explained the interviewee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">For the determination of this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of the mexicans today is 76 years on average.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die of aids fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the emergence of aids, 60 percent of the patients on the basis of national data have died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and will 187 deaths until may of this year; however, it ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why there is still deaths?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So what I envision, so has happened to us in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years, we have had shortages of medicine the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they are unaware of their infection status, or, in later stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Gave a data blunt: "Nine out of every ten patients arrive when you already have some opportunistic infection in what you have to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make diagnoses early and, therefore, will have to provide evidence of detection of a massive way, to all the people who need it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council of Aids Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who came to take the test at a particular laboratory, only motivated because I had made a friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of aids, and even suffered from kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have aids.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they are going to die and you don't want to know anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I'm going to die, I better bust three times a week," say not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, I eat well, I'm exercising, taking the medications.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">Live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Work, I have many activities I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of me and to the other person", he listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENNIUM JALISCO to motivate his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World Aids Day, they are afraid.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">They would say, therefore, that the procedures in support of the survival of the signatures that allow the mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, contrary to international conventions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">On the practical level, the recognition of the judgment issued on June 15 passed by the judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas, left defenseless firms mexican facing the possibility of seizure of their properties in the allende Bravo.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Input, while the judge hearing the case notes that the creditors should be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the contest commercial matters dealt with in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would mean ignoring the cooperation procedural international in cases of insolvency of enterprises with profile transnational.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, to that end, we created the Model Law of the United Nations for the Uniformity of International trade Law, positioning himself as an arbitrator of the American Law Institute.</seg>

<seg id="2">Globetrotters basketball Hector "Hetin" Kings was more than 60 years tied to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has a collection of mind of the history of the local basketball as wide as the have Hector "Hetin" Kings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And is that before a stroke what confinara to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, it was as a player of minor categories, player of the Basketball National Higher, proxy and a leader in the BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamon or president of the Basketball Federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I wore many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federations during the 90's", recalled Kings during a visit First Time to his home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball has been my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Kings don't overdo it when you make that assertion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of your house, almost all of them decorated with photos and memorabilias that denote their wide experience, as well attest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamon in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of all, enriching it with the greatest emotion are the ones that remind of its passage through the Jeans from the middle of the decade of the 50's as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or proxy of the franchise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Those were my best years, the more I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of Jeans since 1967, either as a proxy, coapoderado or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of satisfying, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From then on, he took charge "Cute" Ortiz, who was a great manager," said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and I was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), I said: "I've got a player well-deposit box, 6"7" tall.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want it?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who has had Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, which was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a championship in Bayamon, Gausse would help to bring another more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse be enjoyed, but because of the distance, as for 1988 was already contained in honcho of the federations.</seg>
<seg id="21">For that time preferred to enjoy their actions and those of Mincy in the National Team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we first came to the United States during the pre-olympic in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the 1990 World, where we got fourth place and was to have been bronze not be by one arbitrator canadian who made us repeat in the end-game for the second time, Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">What that group's 1990 World is the best National Team you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Is among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team in the Olympic games in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the one of the Pan-american games held in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it a peeling the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that we won the bronze in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">The team not only kept repeating to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but it also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young people, brother Leo (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "don Quixote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90's due to a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A computer that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was in the pre-olympic 1995 in Neuquen, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With role-players as "Caimito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in substitution of players suspended for the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without a doubt, this has been Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has mastered that level as it did Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And that's not counting his career in the different leagues played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who has been the best leader puerto rican?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a litter very good that includes July Toro, Flower Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Towers.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the young people, I like very much the work of Leo Arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Have been a part of was the most glorious of the National Team between 1988 and 1995, and that of the beginning of the 90's the BSN had until 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What you got to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things he wanted to implement, as the regionalization of the minor categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, the boys of Ponce only play in your area, and only to face teams from other corners of the Island in the playoffs national.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the children are traveling and playing too much of an unnecessary way.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the fruit of the certifications compulsorias and course leaders, table officers and officials.</seg>
<seg id="46">That pleased me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you do now?</seg>
