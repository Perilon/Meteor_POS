<h1>
<seg id="1">A republican strategy to hinder the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The republican leaders justified its policy for the need to fight against the electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Centro Brennan considers this last one myth and states that the electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.</seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, the republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A thing is true: those new arrangements will affect the rate of participation negatively.</seg>
<seg id="6">In that sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system partially.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal choices in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in that same line a majority of the American governments promulgated, from 2009, new laws that obstructed the process of inscription or of vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has extended after the choices of November 2010, which saw the increase of 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently, during the year 2011 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require that the electors present an identity document with a photograph, besides a test of American citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, those laws reduce the periods of anticipated vote, invalidate the law to inscribing as elector on the day of the counting and withdraw its right to vote to the citizens with penal background.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the choices of 2006, no American state demanded that the electors presented an identity document with photograph.</seg>
<seg id="14">The State of Indiana was the first in requiring it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The High Court Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of that, the republican authorities hurried to extend that practice to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last years these authorities have based bills on 34 states to force the electors to present an identity document with photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to take into account that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the American citizens do not have a document of universal identity, as the card of the Social Security.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of the American citizens, that is 21 million people in age of voting do not have any identity document with photograph emitted by a governmental agency of its state.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, five million new electors in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="21">But, often, the obtaining of the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With what, the new restrictions affect disproportionately the youngsters, the minorities and the people with low admissions.</seg>
<seg id="23">In effect, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people who gain less than 35,000 dollars per year, 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of the electors out of 18 and 29 years do not have an identity document with photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And there is still more.</seg>
<seg id="25">In many states the students, the electors who vote the democratic candidates more, cannot use the identity document with photograph emitted by its institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, those same states authorize to the members of the fishing clubs or of hunt who usually vote the republican parties to use the documents emitted by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004 no state demanded the test of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state in presenting this demand.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen of states has taken on laws that require that the electors prove that they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those measures look, clearly, for limiting the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems to be that two of every three Hispanic electors support the democrat party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, the republican legislators leaned certain laws that abolished the inscription of electors the same day of the counting in eight states on 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">Besides, they limited the law of the people and the groups to creating a help service for the electors who wanted to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, in the general elections of 2004, the campaigns of inscription of the electors contributed to the register of about 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures adopted since 2009 managed that the rate of inscription of new electors fell in 2010 in comparison with the year 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Besides, the republican legislators adopted laws in another five states that favored the reduction of the period of vote in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the choices of 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electors who voted in advance were Afro-American, whereas the latter last ones did not represent more than 13% of the electors of the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the case of the Hispanics the same happened exactly.</seg>
<seg id="40">These do not represent more than 11% of the electors, which is equivalent at 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">However, the whites, which represent 76% of the electorate, do not mean more that they vote in advance than 46% of the citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, the democratic legislators and its partisans have opposed fervently the adoption of laws that restrict the register of electors.</seg>
<seg id="43">In this sense, the democratic governors have blocked several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Fiscal Ministry of the United States took part to suspend the most controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">The damages could be limited, partially.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of 34 states took on the law that required the presentation of an identity document with photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, it is undeniable that the new adopted rules will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that with them it is intended to be influential in the results of 2012 in the key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Center Brennan of 2011 proves that the states that these laws have taken on represent 171 of the 270 necessary votes in the polling station to achieve the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too soon to state with certainty if these legislative modifications to scale of electoral system will have a significant impact in the results of the presidential choices of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">A thing is true: those new arrangements will affect the rate of participation negatively.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, the measures will undermine the American democratic system partially.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Detection of the prostate cancer: Being the test done or not making it to him?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In effect, the test of PSA presents useless medical interventions, on occasions, wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after those which is decided to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a reason more that sufficient to do the men to doubt, already reticent of by itself, about whether they should be done or not the tests of detection.</seg>
<seg id="4">Doing the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked two specialists for board of advice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies carried out in the United States a big index of infections among the sample groups was detected, therefore it is difficult to interpret those data and to do firm recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">On its part, the European study showed a certain mortality difference among the patients that had been carried out the detection and the that not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study, with a follow-up at the 12 years, proved besides that it exists between the 30th and 40% of possibilities to suffer metastasis if the test of detection has not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">I recommend, therefore, the test from the 50 years, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The men of Afro-American origin have an index of higher risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take a good decision once the cancer detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is really necessary to manage that the patient understands the degree of risk of its cancer. All the possible options must be offered to him and not necessarily treat the prostate cancers that do not go against the long-term life, in whose case an active surveillance of the illness must rather be opted for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Nowadays many men for whom a cancer has been detected are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive nor entails a risk for its life.</seg>
<seg id="15">In its place, we suggest an active surveillance of the illness to them and, if this one progresses, we offer them a treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We determine every time with more frequency precise criteria to decide who would owe or not to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="17">I recommend that the test be done in any case.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important that it talks with its doctor to determine if the test must be done or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Movember has created a tool that allows evaluating the pros and the disadvantages of the test of PSA, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document can be unloaded (for the moment alone in English, but translations will be offered in little) in the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Preventing the illness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is not a miraculous recipe to prevent the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In spite of the progress of the researches, the adoption of healthy habits of life they follow being the best way of reducing the risks to suffer the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">We estimate that if all the world ate well and moved enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If nobody smoked, that rate would be increased, at least, to 50%", underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Society against the Cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, we evaluate that around 10% of the cancers they are hereditary.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many other ones keep being totally inexplicable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Society against the Cancer, the fight against the tobacco habit keeps being a priority in spite of the decrease of the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The tobacco is linked to 85% of the cases of the lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It constitutes, besides, a risk factor for other types of cancers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The health of the people is damaging enormously.</seg>
<seg id="32">"At present, there is still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", the spokesman André Beaulieu testified.</seg>
<seg id="33">A hopeful data: 10 years after stopping smoking, the risk to die of cancer comes down to the half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The fatness and the obesity favor also the appearance of the illness, according to the SCC.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risks of breast cancer, of colon and of rectum, of esophagus, of pancreas and of uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The researches prove that the regular practice of physical activity during all the life protects against the breast cancer", add.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The feeding</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organism recommends, equally, limiting the consumption of red meats.</seg>
<seg id="40">In great quantities, they make a colorectal cancer climb the risks to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="41">The products of pork butcher must also be prevented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of the meat for his smoked, drying or salting can provoke the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"They can damage the cells of the organism and take to the development of the cancer", explain us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the last years, several scientists have studied the links among the vitamin complexes and the cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, its researches are for the moment not definitive.</seg>
<seg id="47">Segú the SCC, the studies about the vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Whereas in one of them a decrease of the risks of prostate cancer was confirmed, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of the vitamin D in the cancer has not been able to be determined either with clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists in the importance of talking on the concerns and the familiar background of each with its doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">To "do the test of detection does not provoke cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The boson of Higgs in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The advertisement of the probable discovery of the boson of Higgs generated a great shock the summer last, and with reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">He thinks, in effect, that this boson is participative of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all what exists in the universe, nothing else and nothing less.</seg>
<seg id="4">And what it is more, is dealt of the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and of the behavior of the matter, which has not been observed empirically yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicists clearing that is dealt of Higgs is not totally.</seg>
<seg id="6">We no doubt know that there is a new particle and that it resembles a lot the boson of Higgs predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">Besides, new data revealed this week in an important physics congress celebrated in Kyoto seem to confirm that yes it is, although more data are still lacking to be completely sure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Anyway, we suppose that they are Higgs, since the possibilities to make a mistake seem few. We will see what people are about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is a generalized and unavoidable law that implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time, in this big world.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is not way of infringing that norm and does not try it too much, because damage will end up being done.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even if the physics of the particles is a very complex world, it has been proved that also in it there is a law of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that figures, grosso modo, of some of its characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">The physicists classify the particles in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermiones, which they obey wisely at the beginning of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">AND for another the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists that respect does not have for of anything, are or at least not for this principle, what means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the web page The Particle Adventure de los Laboratorios Berkeley that, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons divide into two groups: the inns, of those that we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", for which the great forces of the nature propagate and to which the boson of Higgs would be somehow related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons, one might underline here, are not the exotic bugs that we could believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if it manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as "courier" of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">In effect, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or address is changed, he "messes up" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little as when we launch a stone to a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of the light, of the infrared ones, of the ultraviolet ones, etc.) appears, and this wave is not another thing than a photon is; that is, one of the "carrier bosons "of force".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same with the boson of Higgs happens, with the difference that it is about another field, the field of Higgs, which needs to be "untidy" so that this boson appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the field of Higgs is much more stable than the electromagnetic field is. In order to be activated it it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only one thick rock could slide through the surface.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because of that an immense accelerator of particles as that of the CERN is necessary (the big colisionador of hadrones is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relation between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all the particles nor all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, as the magnets, do it, but others not: a paper bit, for example, will never remain stuck to the door of a fridge by itself.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the field of Higgs: those that do it have a mass, whereas the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, what they can contribute all those researches?, Mrs. Plamondon asks.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science, this serves for verifying the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, besides, that the escrutinen physicists the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.</seg>
<seg id="30">On its part, many want fervently them to be found, for the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes of the model up.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, has that saying it, still has enormous lacks, as that it does not suggest any explanation related to the gravity (ups!) or to the dark matter, which it forms around 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But we have not found such differences in the CERN up to the moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Repercussions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The repercussions of these researches in our everyday life are difficult to predict, but we do not think that we make a mistake when saying that it will not have any.</seg>
<seg id="35">So that they see: at the beginning of the sixties, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories did not suspect the revolution that its works would provoke at all.</seg>
<seg id="36">They made out the scientific applications, but just.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, as already it said the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratories Bell, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that elaborated the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "device of laboratory".</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine it...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that it surrounds to the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle elaborated a light pick-up device in 1969 in the course of its research on the subject of optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">Even though it was not its original intention at all, this pick-up device acts now as "eye" for all the digital devices of the world, which cost the Nobel of physics for him in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC want necessarily to transform our lives, but that is never known...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Mitigating cares. The best way of dying... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In its Commission Die in dignity, Quebec discussed recently the delicate question of the end of the life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be taken up soon while a bill is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, in that essential domain, still there is a lot to make.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has tried to see it from near.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Hardly some weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in its apartment of the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cancer of prostate that was destroying him had given him a rest of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Had hit me five years of life, but already take like this seven", relates, done one passes, knocked down in its bed in the center of mitigating cares Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil, to which it arrived on the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared to this", continues.</seg>
<seg id="10">The illness has caused him destructions: an enormous weakness that prevents it to be alone to the bath and even to eat by itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting in the face of a tempting lunch, he accepts that they help it eat resigned itself.</seg>
<seg id="12">Valiente, manages even to smile, to talk with the strangers who dedicate attentions to him, they bring him medicines and they offer him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My biggest desire is that they cure me the diarrhoea, is humiliating", confesses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some hours later, the team found remedy to that one badly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does pis standing", relates Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the center Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">To go back to its childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That depends on the capacity of the person to accept that regression", confirms.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, according to the opinion of most of the people who work in mitigating cares, the great moments they take place in the heart of that regression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">All the patients who enter the center of mitigating cares Victor-Gadbois suffer cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a maximum life prediction in three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In that state, the team of doctors and nurses who already surround them they do not offer the "curative" cares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The biggest fear of Madam A., of 89 years, it is to die "conscious and drowned".</seg>
<seg id="24">But the illness has made him discover its children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have some good children", adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"More desires do not remain any longer me in this life", says, before accepting that a mask is placed for her to help her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">And he waits, on the next days, for a last visit of its son who lives in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In Victor-Gadbois the body care is offered, with a group of volunteers, and it helps the feeding.</seg>
<seg id="29">Care is taken of palliatives that are given to them when nothing can be made more.</seg>
<seg id="30">To help to its death being more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec we have a bed of mitigating cares for every 11,700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, since we know that we all will end up dying some day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, the life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.</seg>
<seg id="34">Be already as for physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">To the moribund one rinsings of mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand, are offered.</seg>
<seg id="36">Its rate of sugar is not controlled for the diabetics any longer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The death is part of what is daily.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday at night we serve a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, its son was finished the beer at the feet of the deceased man.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help to the patients as well as to its loved ones", relates Nathalie Savard, manageress of the cares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the center Victor-Gadbois the days go by without being ever equal.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to a man of 94 years that he savors its last familiar meeting in the courtyard, well placed among its pillows while they all drink to its health, a youngster of 36 years dies tragically, surrounded by its fathers, its woman and its two children, after having tried everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"Since six months ago, there are always from three to five beds occupied by people younger than 45 years ill of cancer", Dr. Christiane Martel worries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients who are admitted in the center Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from its home and 47% of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of the access to mitigating cares</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">77% of the Canadians simply does not have access to the mitigating cares, that is, to the cares conceived to relieve the suffering when one ill arrives to the terminal phase of its life, either in its residence, in hospital or in a center of cares.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organisms, as the center Victor-Gadbois and the society of mitigating cares door-to-door of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">What makes many doctors specialized in mitigating cares fear the adoption of a law that regulates the euthanasia and the assisted suicide is precisely that great relative lack in the sanitary cares of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since the month of October, a manifesto signed by eminences of the mitigating cares, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, it circulates to prove its opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the sanitary system of Quebec is not competent enough as to guarantee that any has the right to mitigating cares of quality before it is agreed to proceed with the euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Recently", it relates, "I have seen a patient to spend 14 days in Urgency suffering great pains without what is necessary having been made to relieve her.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear the patients wanting it alone to die because they do not receive the adequate cares".</seg>
<seg id="53">And parallelly, many oncologists persist with its patients until the last day, in spite of the worst predictions.</seg>
<seg id="54">The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already under minimums when he left a treatment of chemotherapy exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="55">"When I made out my oncologist that wanted that stopped the treatment, she told me that was it very pitiful that it wanted to stop fighting", relates.</seg>
<seg id="56">"However, she had told me that there was not anything more than that it did!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There are not almighty cares</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Dra Martel believes that 90% of the ill that they request to die thank to its carers that have not attended to them in its demands once its pain has been relieved for them thanks to a team of mitigating cares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it has to be said that the mitigating cares are not absolutely almighty as for the treatment of the pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereau, manageress of the mitigating cares door-to-door of Grand Montréal, the patients do not answer to the treatments against the pain by 8% of the cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of the life, the doctors usually recur to the mitigating sedation, which is used for making the patient sleep up to the moment of its decease, either of a sporadic form or in a permanent way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot feign that we do not understand that part of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Every time more, the not relieved illness is going to have the possibility to have that mitigating sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">The ill that they are not relieved say all the same: "I want to die".</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not mean necessarily "I want the euthanasia", but "I want for them to relieve me".</seg>

<seg id="1">Property scandals of great extent in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Civil servants of the road net, businessmen of the BTP, collectors of funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia count, day after day, what know of a formidable "system", of which the building industry, political civil servants, unionists and members of the mafia are part.</seg>
<seg id="3">An "industry" that went out too much expensive to the quebequenses contributors, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is curious how the system is pulverized once we have hunted to the great means", Jacques Duchesneau, representative in Quebec and former head of the Police of Montreal, satirizes.</seg>
<seg id="5">He led the outburst of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a research in depth on the misappropriations tied up with road contracts in Quebec, that the first liberal minister of that moment, Jean Charest, had not allowed more that in deferring.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "report Duchesneau" established a direct link among the industry, the clandestine financing of the parties and the corruption among civil servants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"From the beginning of the research in 2010, only the ministry of transports would have saved itself a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts of staying with a proportional part.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Commission Charbonneau "it has already done to fall to two mayors", adds, while she expects to be able get to "prove the existing stratagems behind the individuals".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A unit permanent anticorruption, created in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Unit permanent anticorruption, created in 2011, is applied also with its team of inspectors, investigators and analysts of the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">This unit works besides the policemen of "the set square Marteau", that, since 2009, they have made that the "cartel of the sewerage" of Montreal is moderated at the time of inflating contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">These last weeks, the unit has come to the series register from the accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of the outskirts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The next one of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from its post of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">Itself suspicion that has pocketed repeated bribery in exchange for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Engineers of the road net of Montreal and businessmen of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been accused formally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter last one has caused shock when explaining the mechanism of the "system" of obtaining of public contracts to the commission.</seg>
<seg id="17">He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary tied up with the Mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">M. Zambito divided up money right and left during the years 2000, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the ruling liberals.</seg>
<seg id="19">It admitted, equally, having organized a collection of illegal funds for the ex-viceprimera liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The inflation of the cost of the sewerage contracts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked with efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, exengineer of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years all that received gifts, invitations to journeys, tournaments of golf, restaurants, parties of hockey and bribery of companies of the sector of the construction for a total of 736,000 dollars, in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs inflated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other civil servants of the road net have admitted that they received money because they inflated the bills between 30% and 40% in concept of false extras expenses.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused to M. Tremblay of having turned a blind eye deliberately to a parallel budget and filled its arks with dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November and took Montreal to an enormous crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first policies elect of Montreal that the alarm made sound.</seg>
<seg id="27">As mayoress of the district of Rivière-de Prairies, in the east of the island, it opposed since 2010 on sale of a municipal ground acquired by 5 million dollars and property boom resold to the whole promoters for 1.6 million.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of the money of the election campaigns was dirty money</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Of the research that finally will be carried out, she assures that she pulls a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and to fish to the guilty ones.</seg>
<seg id="30">And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive".</seg>
<seg id="31">We are cleaning the wounds but a unit of clean research in Montreal would be necessary and to be very alert so that the doubtful practices are not repeated.</seg>
<seg id="32">How to do the cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau, on its part, declares that "the civil servants have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is restless especially for the paper of the 'politicians elect up-to-date of the stratagem".</seg>
<seg id="35">Rating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, satirizes: "they have told me that that is not more than a pale reflection of the reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebecois government suggests limiting the donations to parties at 100 dollars, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as the electoral expenses are not limited strictly, there will be dirty money in the policy".</seg>
<seg id="37">It advocates a complete revision of the system of granting of public contracts and of financing of the parties: more we "cannot fall under; going to the fund of the things, with courage, will allow us to reconstruct the home with some more solid bases, with more controls and laws."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this history steams the international image of Quebec and of Montreal up, M. Duchesneau invites to those that laugh to be looked to the mirror.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season it has acquired a new entity with the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How would it explain that advance?</seg>
<seg id="4">It could be explained for one taking of individual consciousness, but also for the new dimension of the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players have arrived.</seg>
<seg id="6">I advance in the daytime on day at its side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has also provided me a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">And those elements push me daily to increase the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a party, that is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is very fast in the soccer.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not get worked up.</seg>
<seg id="12">From my beginnings in the center of preformation of INF Clairefontaine up to my step for Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced to enlarged steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">He is going to obtain profit for the competence recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">The ones recruited of this summer are used to play parties of very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know that every training is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">That makes a player as me feel like fighting and giving it.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti provides me a lot as for my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is backed up for attached as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">At present, there is not anybody equal in the League 1 and it is among the best European trainers.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that he will take other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I had a very soothing conversation with it.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had just gone out from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that it has in me explains also my good performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What does he think on the PSG in the first part of the season?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the League 1, Lyons has taken away the leader post from us.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we continue in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our biggest goals is the League of champions: we have classified ourselves for the eighth of end with style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Which is the goal of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We are going to try to arrive as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now, he can pass anything.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want, to start with, to finish the first of our league in front of the Oporto to be able to receive the turn of eighth of end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the PSG convert in a big short-term European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">It already has the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to convert in a big European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">At present, that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">At economic standard, the PSG is delivered to its means so that that project becomes definite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not winning the glass in the League 1, as in the last season, would it constitute a great failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we do not arrive far.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May we take a disappointment, since we had the optimal conditions to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had a strong season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finish with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpelier, had a quite better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year I think that it will be the good one.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams as Marseille, Lyons and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to take it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Does he think that the means wait for more of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that they wait a lot of us if we think in what has been invested in the players that we have.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have totally accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="57">After we gained 4-0 at home to Troyes, that they still find things that to reproach us is a little frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what else the people wait for.</seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to gain 4-0 all the weekends.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to start off a game project.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is built with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the League of champions we have proved that we can answer and be present.</seg>
<seg id="64">They look to the Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not managed to be classified for eighth of end, and them they have also inverted very much!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the inverted sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.</seg>
<seg id="66">That would be to neglect to our opponents and the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyons and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been seen "given" impulse by this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">That proves that the League 1 is thrilling.</seg>
<seg id="69">I expect us in May to be able to say with a smile that, in spite of all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Better that we say that we have a "Zlatandependencia".</seg>
<seg id="72">That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that it puts many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He has come to prove that it is the star of the League 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">And, a world star, has proved in all the teams for which it has happened that he is a great player.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group we respect the man and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">And he also respects the men that he has around you.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has made is really exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">That pushes those ones to increase its level of game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of the world, allows us all also to progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you lived the Euroglass 2012 with the team of France?</seg>
<seg id="81">It has been a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was gotten very excited because it took part in this Euroglass.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating time of game.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things there and went out reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today achievement to play good parties in the selection.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is what it waited for from my baptism with the "bleus".</seg>
<seg id="87">We learned the lesson of what he passed in Ukraine and is due to that that today we have an exemplary behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Which vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the front of the "bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He is obtaining results.</seg>
<seg id="90">They are well situated in the classification group for the World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="91">The manager is rigorous, near to the players and breaths in to win.</seg>
<seg id="92">As it was the case of Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want to do comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc achieved its goal to classify us for the Euroglass.</seg>
<seg id="95">I expect Didier Deschamps to take the selection to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Was the draw (1-1) of the 16 of October in Spain used for laying the foundations?</seg>
<seg id="97">That game gave us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought for all of them.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before that shock in Spain, he had not lived a similar game in all my race.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">With Bitcoin, to pay and to sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the contrary to the current monetary exchanges, based on the central banks, the identified transactions and the loads of prosecution among the parts.</seg>
<seg id="3">Besides, as it often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, compound of bank monopolies, leads to the financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a convertible virtual coin at dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol of safe change to the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Nearly 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 computers of the net.</seg>
<seg id="6">And near about a thousand web sites they accept the bitcoins as donations or as form of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The quotation of the bitcoin, after having arrived to the summit of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell at 2 dollars five months later, before roaming again today the ten dollars (the quotations register on page bitcoincharts.com in the census).</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not at all impressive if we compare it with the world changes in real coin or in financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (BCE) showed interest in it in a report on the virtual coins published in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">In it, the bitcoin as "the virtual coin" was described with more success, "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional coins".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is differentiated from other systems with types of virtual coins as the "credits", used to advance in a vídeojuego and that can be gained playing or can be bought (and even on occasions to exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social net Facebook developed also this type of system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But in every exchange a central authority controls and she treats the changes.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the bitcoin, all the net nodes are at the same time trustees of, verificatory accounting books, issuers of coin and buyers and salespersons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does that net work?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction between two users is done in fact between two electronic addresses in the form of electronic mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">A user can choose a different address for every payment, guaranteeing like this the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">An ensemble of information tied up with this transaction is signed electronically through a system of reckoned to double key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The net can verify the authenticity of the transaction like this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to guarantee that the changes of bitcoins figure in the public book of accounts, which is spread by all the net.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key milestone consists in writing that new transaction in that book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This one passes for the resolution from a mathematical challenge launched to the computers and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase of one cut up of file, that is, of transformation of a big file in a shorter and more only numerical mark.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers "catch" the new transaction and add a number before "cutting" the ensemble up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number that offers a particular mark (more zeros at first).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once he finds that number, the other nodes verify easily that it is the good one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then tied up with the chain of ensembles of the other transactions indestructibly; every modification would change the mark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If, in order to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the net would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other one would remain orphan, since they both have different marks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to prevent the inflation, that reward divides into two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is, then, limited to 21 million, but are divisible up to the one hundredth millionth, what leaves a wide margin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of this challenge is revealed also in every increase of the problem solving power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the net already has its up and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The web sites that services offer for Bitcoin have been attacked and bonded bitcoins have been stolen.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The used failure does not affect to the same protocol", insures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a payment company in real coin that uses the net Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The BCE takes the possibilities of blanquo of money into account besides thanks to this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the ready money presents the same default.</seg>
<seg id="38">The weighty actors as Wikipedia reject the payments of this type.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, as the platform Wordpress, accept them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that near 80% of bitcoins it does not circulate.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November the "gigantic lowerings" were launched.</seg>
<seg id="42">"30,000 dollars" "were changed", Jon Holmquist, which works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins into gold, delights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogic book on that coin, believes quite a lot in the potential of this technology besides of in the net of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="44">Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real coin) or to a payment for mobile without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, that like this they go out cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The bearer, besides, manages its identity and can remain, therefore, in the anonymity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to start off in the trades, which do not have to install new terminals or softwares.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is them enough to supply an address that a telephone can "photograph and to recognize", precise Pierre Noizat, who assures to have thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement of revision of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Will be necessary a time so that Bitcoin is imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change", predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">On the other hand, in its report the BCE foresees to revaluar the different risks, today considered high, if this coin has success.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The French troops left its responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).</seg>
<seg id="4">The NATO and the Americans must go out at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is an hour that the Afghan army takes up possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose its future, without waiting for anything of us.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have punished especially the Afghan peasants, who we have considered terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="7">And to ourselves, with our 88 murdered soldiers, more the injured persons and the cripples.</seg>
<seg id="8">Taliban count with foreign extremists and former heads taken refuge in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to defend its traditions, old and archaic, even if the jihadist ones, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the uzbecos or Tajikistanis join its causes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tolerated, sometimes even sites helped by the insurgents, these will not be any longer when the occidental ones are made more discrete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The game of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, which I observed from what was high of the hills planted of almond trees thanks to the French credits, was done for order.</seg>
<seg id="12">The convoys of trucks and of tanks went back, supervised by the helicopters, to Kabul without suffering any attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">There will not be flow of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The circumstances have changed from its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was then emptiness and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the fights among different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its taking of control of the country had been perceived as a sort of release, the return to the safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of its peasants surpassed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but its situation is not better today.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old mujahideens, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to maintain the women in an inferior position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to the power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have converted in speculators, getting hold of governmental grounds to resell them as sites for the refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting at the same time from enormous American contracts of subcontracting.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are discredited; most of them have not fought.</seg>
<seg id="22">The people, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many youngsters want to leave, as those will also leave that have known how to take advantage of the American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The youngsters are tired of the war and of its ideologies.</seg>
<seg id="25">They have lived the modern world during its exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have noticed its advantages.</seg>
<seg id="26">With around of 65% of its population younger than 25 years, Kabul counts right now on 5 million inhabitants, a fifth part of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the cities, the state schools are full of girls as well as of children.</seg>
<seg id="28">Work will have to be given to those youngsters who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties nor to the corruption of certain leaders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They, once the armed opposition has been included, are all eager for mobile telephones. The television and its Turkish serials that present a modern world has great fans in all the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The army is now present.</seg>
<seg id="31">Will the authorities that want to manage the country be considered legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">The former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight already concern themselves to reconstitute the provincial militias, which will avoid the central power.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization to image of the occidental nations. However, the United States have wanted it to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the post of the first minister who existed from the Constitution of 1964.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="34">The president Karzai does not want the foreign control, particularly for the occasion of the choices foreseen in April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, its country depends of the foreign help since the fifties and even before.</seg>
<seg id="36">No industry has reestablished its services, any reservoir has not been fixed nor the important irrigation systems have been repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported and nothing takes place except fruit and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority is left to the private initiative.</seg>

<seg id="42">Without energy to extract the minerals of iron or of copper of the ground and without means of transport to export them across the mountains, there is not mine.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have almost already left the copper mines of Month Aynak, leaving that the international archeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers of the province.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A Constitution with forceps in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is one new double or nothing of the president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whereas Egypt is more divided up that as for the constitutional declaration, which grants it full powers provisionally, he never decided to play the all for the all.</seg>
<seg id="4">He took Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the day after, from all the candid world.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only one week ago, the head of state had given its works two months more to this Assembly to finish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And does almost two years that Egypt uses a temporary text, several times, what weakens the institutional stability and takes judicial confusions, modified.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has not made more the fracture to increase in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For its opponents, the president perseveres in its "autocratic frenzy" and continues "betraying its word" and "trampling on the law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the part of its partisans, it is assured that it is a measure to finish more rapid with the institutional and political crisis and to speed the transitional process up.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next 15 days a referendum should be organized.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short time lapse that it obliges the Brothers to renouncing to its project of explaining the text, article for article, to the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way of recovering a popular and democratic legitimation while the controversy causes destructions in all the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote its favor, as it stated in an interview to the American weekly Time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that that resource has been voted with a lot of speed, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that supposedly will arrive to its end with the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It is in that strange atmosphere in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its great majority, voted the text yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the liberals did not go to the call.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mid November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they estimated that they could not make its points of view be valid.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of the human rights, the minorities religious and of the civil society made the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">So that the necessary quorum was achieved, it was added to 11 people, substitute members, yesterday in the morning as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very near to the Muslim Brothers.</seg>
<seg id="21">As one might have waited, the voted articles have been unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">To the commentators it does grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so much is so several members of the committee got to think that the clock of the Constituent was badly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally the article 2, object of all the looks, keeps being identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source" in a right side out way".</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for those who the establishment of the Islamic law is a basic claim, expected "the principles" "" to be able to be replaced by "the norms", what had allowed a stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of its good will and of its respect to the other components of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is labeled of hypocrisy by the liberals and they consider that it is not treated more than of an advertising trick.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They refer, especially, to the article 220, which confers a consultative paper on the University Al-Azhar, particularly for any one that has to confirm its conformity with the laws of the Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce herself are not chosen and does not have any democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy".</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the liberals are seen besides increased because the next rector of this university would be quite less moderate than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For now, there is not a specific religious implication.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution we are within the framework of the marital state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the jurists that have working in that text they are not ulemas but university students, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he recognizes that there can be a certain ambiguity about the article 220, for the used terms imitate the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We refer specifically to the iqh term [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].</seg>
<seg id="38">And the question that he could consider in the future would be in which measure they are the competent civil judges for this to be pronounced above all".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers that it confers on the president of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few in comparison with which they were during the previous regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another conflict point: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to the desire for the soldiers, the revision of the budget of Defense will not be submitted to the Parliament, but to a national board of advice of defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">The prosecutions of civilians will not be forbidden either in military courts, as they asked for the associations for the defense of the human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These also showed its concerns related to the text, which they consider liberticidal.</seg>
<seg id="45">The blasphemy crime is maintained and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, which could entail severe consequences for the freedom of speech, especially that of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Besides, no article emphasizes the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of the torture according to the article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Although the Egyptian president had to go out yesterday at night in the television, demonstrations are foreseen for this midday.</seg>
<seg id="50">The partisans of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The big and powerful" te will take up to Moscow: immigrants save for the language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While representatives and human rights campaigners discuss on the consequences that it would bring the law on the obligatory examination, swindlers who trade with "false" certificates have already appeared in the country</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the main citizens of countries of Asia are a headquarters: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its only goal is to gain money to help its families that have stayed at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since the 1st of December a law, according to which every work immigrant will have to carry out an examination to check its knowledge of the Russian language, comes into effect.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this rule is applicable only for those that have the intention of working in the sector of rendering of services, institutions of community services, domestic services and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, with time, as they are promising in the Federal Service of Immigration, the examinations will be made obligatory for all the immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides, it will not be sufficient with yielding the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and that of bases of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed even to receive and to renew the work license.</seg>
<seg id="11">The citizens of the countries are an exception where the Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">The people who managed to obtain its certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Utility, fatality and defense of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The net of centers examiners will work backed by the Institute of Russian Language Pushkin, the University of the Friendship of the People, the State University of Moscow, the State University of Saint Petersburg and other institutions of higher education Russian.</seg>
<seg id="15">The immigrants will be able to present to the tests in all the cities, right now in Russia they are more than 160 centers of this type opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the representatives of the State Parliament and by the Federal Service of Immigration.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the defenders of the rights, that a lot people before of the law coming into effect, managed many times to ask the press this question: And what will provide this in fact?</seg>
<seg id="18">Which changes will the obligatory nature of the knowledge of the language bring, for the Russians as well as for the immigrants themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the first place, they answer the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will allow reducing the number of people that suffer "work slavery".</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people talk today on the defense of the rights of the work immigrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Service of Immigration of Russia in Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">The defense of its rights must begin before its game.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only one system of organized selection will allow solving the problem of the immigrant workers by 90% of the cases.</seg>
<seg id="23">The immigrants without profession, education, the ones that do not know the language nor pass the medical control, have the problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the understanding of the language, it states Sebelev, the immigrant future will be seen condemned to finding gutless people that, with the pretext of helping, put a "paid viajecito" to one hair-raising and narrows hovel, where he and dozens of others as him are consumed during months without food nor documents, working from 12 to 14 hours per day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive a large number of complaints of our immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In its homeland they promise them a thing, but when arriving are tricked, its passports is deprived them, do not pay them the promised salaries", confirms the Head of the Address of work immigration of the Service of immigration of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Jefecito, does not become annoyed!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, meanwhile many citizens of the republics of Central Asia that want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but besides in its own language they write with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not its fault but its own misfortune so much: few are the turkmenos, uzbecos, Tajikistanis who can give themselves the luxury of receiving normal primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is due to its families not even having anything to feed the children on, because they do not talk about dressing them any longer, wedge them and buy them what is necessary for the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">When arriving to the adolescence, these boys dare to work to the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if the language is not known, recognize they.</seg>
<seg id="33">"One feels humiliated and inferior".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, as for the law on the language, the defenders of the rights indicate an important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.</seg>
<seg id="36">If they do not have that status, there will not be even examination and, consequently, any official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, most of the immigrant workers keep living in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome or the step forbidden to strangers"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many visitors state that receiving the official status in our country is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in itself.</seg>
<seg id="41">Besides, the legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, a false inscription can be done quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that generally we take false documents, we are not registered and the cases of extortion appear.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They ask us a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea", commented to the journalists on the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Vamos, you are not tightfisted, buys a paint"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was shown that not only the documents of register of immigrants can be false.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several "false" certificates of knowledge of the language already have been confiscated by civil servants of the Federal Service of Immigration.</seg>
<seg id="48">The forged documents had been printed in standard printers of color.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they arrived to the hands of the new owners not as I give away: every immigrant, it being wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is twice and a half more expensive that the official procedure of examination, which will cost to the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task for a near future is to protect the system against the corruption so that the "diplomas" cannot be bought, the civil servants of the government and the defenders of the rights converge.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Ministry of the Interior does not take action drastic against the illegal trade of weapons</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite a lot reduced</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Ministry of the Interior suggests applying the law with bigger rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the reaction of the government in the face of the recent incidents: Tightening shots during wedding celebrations in those that for luck there were not victims, and the massacre initiated by the lawyer muscovite Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Apretar seven people lost the life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The police want to forbid the use and the possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to increase the minimum age for the obtaining of license to carry weapons, of 18 years at 21 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">This idea was supported by the head of the committee of the Parliament on the subject of safety and the one who promised fights against the corruption, Irina Yarovaya, that the reforms in the law on the possession weapons will be taken to the Parliament of the State in a near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Not all of them feel happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counteract this problem applying the "strong-arm policy".</seg>
<seg id="8">In the net an open letter has appeared, whose authors, representatives of different social organizations of handles, demand that such measures of "meaningless rigor" are given up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of registered weapons is minimum, commented in the service of news BBC of Russia, the lawyer criminologist Vasiliy Lésnikov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, in the face of the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period, were committed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are sure of a stricter legislation in the sector of weapons of civil use not being an inconvenience so that the criminal goes to the black market.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, according to its words, in Moscow he can find any weapon to low price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, in the Ministry of the Interior it is stated that the situation of the proliferation of weapons illegal is found under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: from factories up to officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The black market of weapons is supplied through several channels.</seg>
<seg id="16">The main channels are years, withdrawn Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High Staff, says the colonel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot of the web site that accepts weapon orders</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first, "vestige of the exercise or to militate", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasian same ones", says Baranets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The following type of "weapon negra",las stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranets explains that here the weapons stolen of the stores of the police and those ones stolen directly by civil servants of the organs of fulfillment of the law are included.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The illegal weapons come out on sale from the military arsenals.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military arsenals there were often explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There are proved versions that some fires were provoked premeditatedly to cover the mistake", comments on an exsoldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to Baranets, the manufacturers of weapons also put its sand granite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Now private factories of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under string to the black market, that of Moscow included have proliferated", says the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">One source more of the black market is the smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A great quantity of pistols and machine guns originate from poor countries as Kirghizia.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There they have its own production, sometimes artisanal, and has been formed a Mafia that has organized the flow of weapons", explains the ex soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Of where the weapons come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The experts have calculated which is the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this subject was elaborated in 2011 through the Center of analysis of problems and planning of the public management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The specialists analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminologic bibliography and data of public access of portals whose subject he turns about the weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The big majority of the illegal weapons, according to the investigators, originate from the armed forces and from the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of the weapons of the black market has arrived there "because of civil servants whose work is related to the weapons", is said in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the investigators, 17% of the weapons originate from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases is stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the "illegal archeology".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The shop assistant of one of the weapon stores, which asked that its surname were not mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators does not buy them anybody from does already a lot of time because they are too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">More often, it says, the suppliers go to military stores when they need a game.</seg>
<seg id="39">Through some second lieutenant, the supplier buys a unit, for example a pistol TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">They eliminate it from the register and they pass it above the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This one takes the weapon to the city and sells it at 900 euros for unit with two chargers", counts us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"But, clear, the police this one to the so much of all the matters, so periodically, when it has to be complied the plan of discovery of crimes, they carry out probationary purchases to the traders of illegal weapons", adds the shop assistant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"As in a boutique of luxury"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The salesman and the buyer are usually through acquaintances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I visited web pages and blogs even that a type that suggested to me that it went to the platform "Begovaya", where a man would be that would take to an "esquinita" where we could negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="46">I found out only there, about the price of the weapon."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Military commentator Viktor Baranets</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"In order to obtain a weapon I need a friend that has contacts", says the shop assistant of the store. "I have a friend like this, but I do not trust it a lot".</seg>
<seg id="49">In the markets there are salespersons, but there also has to be arrived, we say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked that it told its daughter that a tooth had fallen it."</seg>
<seg id="50">Even I can obtain a couple of steel mittens through a trustworthy-hand person.</seg>
<seg id="51">He also supplies only me with them because he knows that I am not going to report him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The novices look for weapons in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The ex soldier Viktor Baranets tested himself in the paper of buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the years 1990, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="54">The schemas, according to its words, have not changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">They delivered an album of photos to him where there was not "of totality".</seg>
<seg id="56">I "felt as in a boutique of luxury", it remembers the soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">According to words of Baranets, they do not offer, the buyer, cat for hare: all what there is can be proved.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, as potential customer, not only buy; we go with the salesman to the forest, where we put one white.</seg>
<seg id="59">"They give me the opportunity of shooting and when I make sure of the weapon shooting well, we start to negotiate", the expert describes the procedure.</seg>

<seg id="72">The people do the orders.</seg>
<seg id="73">The buyer carries out the payment through an automatic teller.</seg>
<seg id="74">"In answer, they send it a photo and the instructions so that the weapon knows where it is hidden ", the press secretary of the ONG relates "The right to the weapons", Dmitri Kislov.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The employees of restaurants of snack food and supermarkets in the US set in strike.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fourth part of American adolescents up to one find its first works as cash dispensers in "McDonald's"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">On the last days, in the United States a wave of protests has begun against the low salaries that are paid in the supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and in restaurants of the popular chains of snack food, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Wooden Peg Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For now nobody dares to affirm if it will arrive or not this wave to the nine points, or if it has destined to lose forces and to become tame in its first stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protest actions have the support of the trade unions and of a left-wing series of ONG.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besides the increase of the modest salaries earned by the workers of Walmart and those of the system of snack food, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions of workers in these companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">For now, this sector of the economics has practically not been occupied by the union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Forty and six cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The actions started last week, after the day of Acción of Gracias, the called "Black Friday". That day, in the coomenzaba United States the orgy of lowerings that captured millions of inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied of confrontations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">That day, some workers of the corporation Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left its jobs and formed pickets of protest beside the trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the corporation, whose products are addressed to people of modest and moderate admissions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells of everything, from diapers, rifles of hunt and batteries for cars, up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores are of average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the biggest supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is because of what many underpaid workers of Walmart buy only in the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and the assortment of products have acted as Walmart one of the biggest corporations of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the words two critics, Walmart can be allowed the luxury of selling products to very low price, partially because it pays its workers little.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter last ones also complain about the bad working conditions, such as the lack of goods elevator or scanners of hand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase of salaries and complained about the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation passing of 30 at 100 monthly dollars.</seg>
<seg id="18">For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives 9.5 dollars per hour, this expense is excessive, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists of the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to 12 $ per hour, this will cost to the corporation 3.2 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is approximately 1.1% more of what it uses up in salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart places the wage increase in the shoulders of the consumers, every visit will be them only 46 cents more expensive to the store.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a year they will use up the ridiculous quantity of 12.39 dollars more of what they use up now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The partisans of Walmart comment that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the "Black Friday" it went on in its stores since 8 in the afternoon of Thursday until the midnight of the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total, its cash registers carried out on the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the left-wing web site Huffington Post, that they left its job "less than five" used of Walmart and that the protest had not been more than "another trick of public relations", organized by the trade union of workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free box!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York, in those that the goals were not precisely the department stores Walmart (which in this city progressist do not have appreciation for them, and because of that for now there is not any), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says that it sells thousands of millions of portions, and they afterwards not even grant you the sick leave and they do not pay you by your honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, member of the Municipal Board of Advice of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At present, according to the federal statute and that of New York, the minimum salary is of 7.25 $ per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">The restaurants of snack food keep increasing it with time, but only slightly, and of average, the ordinary workers receive dollars in New York 8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody gains less than they in this city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me is a little incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when almost the fourth part of the American adolescents passed for the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part time after the school, although they still lived with its fathers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few were those that saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a lot of time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, constantly slip in some interviews with workers of McDonald's that complain about their having to live of this salary, and sometimes my even feed its children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author indicates that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know how with what to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants in the protests, which started to the 6:30 of the morning of Thursday in the McDonald's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that 15 $ per hour start to be paid to the cash dispensers and cooks of snack food to them at least, that is, that its at the minimum current salary is doubled for them.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also required that in the sector of the snack food trade unions of workers are created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The law of the US. forbids the administration to prevent them from this law and to punish the activists of the union movement with subtleties and dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates them the life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But, for objective reasons, it is easy that the trade unions cover the rápid sector of food.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of the staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discordant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action took place to half of the rally in the McDonald's the member of the Municipal Board of Advice of the city situated near Times Square, which several local democratic politicians took part in, particularly Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says that it is selling thousands of millions of portions, and afterwards not even gives you a hospital or pay te by your honest work".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators received the support of other distinguished democrats of New York, for example of the candidate to mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, that it said that "we must support the workers of the sector of snack food so that they manage to receive just salaries and the economic prosperity that deserves every neoyorkino".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As the newspaper New York Times described it, this has been the biggest demonstration of this type in the American history of the snack food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But in it they took part only a few hundreds of people, even not all them were used of the service of snack food, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people of New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not clear yet if this will act as spark to provoke a massive movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"For now, to trick to the brain not easy result"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The subject of the increased reality, that is so popular among the amateurs of the modern technologies, is mainly lately perceived with normality through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer, in its annual conference Google proved a model in movement and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had presented also an application to claim the corresponding patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, of a conversation with the head of the group of interactive technology 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, was elucidated that for the scientists of this company, the glasses already belonged to a last stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">The perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with the bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces attracts them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please, in general terms, which is the object of study of its research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We dedicate ourselves person-computer to the interaction, but besides we try to extend the limits of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now the humanity in its big mass has remained caught in the work stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes the headdress with the finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and to guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the console Xbox and the sensors Kinect represent a step ahead and no Xbox is sold nowadays without Kinect, since the control interests all of them for gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What else brings us the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Even though Kinect has taken the interaction at the physical layer, a great part of this one still happens in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The information introduction has improved (the system receives more data), and the exit is not very good yet.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, we work in display systems really three-dimensional, based on different technologies, including those of design.</seg>
<seg id="15">The world of the computer science to ours, to the physicist, must be released to make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only to the user, but also the space that surrounds it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects of a more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the first place, to the devil with those foolish helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think on the control for voice?</seg>
<seg id="20">A very popular detail, but does he not think that they overestimate it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Clearing that cannot be considered a panacea for him, remains pending of solving the question of privacy, since it is not always wanted for the others to find out about our actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all the types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in the one that we think in the gestures, but not in loose, but shorter movements.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that registered the movement of the bones and the muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">For now it is very big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How is it that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how would you ask me for you to pass him this soda tin?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will talk and will show you at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Normally I only talk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- That is, do you want to oblige the users to adapting to what can or the machine cannot do now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but is a mutual approach.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in a near future we are mainly going to have to work in the design of new types of sensors that can determine the reactions of the person with accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="35">These can be, for example, laser sensors, since they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If we talk about its work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect, which complaints do you have of the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to obtain 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From this last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives the designers of algorithms more work.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is, that we have to remember not only the resolution in the x axes and Y, but also in Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">The speed, the number of frames per second, is also important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The human movements are quite dynamic and the current ones of 30 fps are really scarce, especially for the gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory in Redmond, made a sensor of contact with adjustable delay of prosecution of 1 at 100 msec and one may mention that the modern mass-produced sensors are nearer to the second value (60-100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not all the world understands in which measure this affects the man-machine interaction.</seg>
<seg id="47">An equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more would be very useful for my work for me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- The Kinect has now three "cameras", some of whom is in fact the issuer of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the third camera is in fact a simple sensor of the visible diapason.</seg>
<seg id="51">This one is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially, more quantity of cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or on the contrary, to increase it and to increase the quantity required from calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be good to create one analogous flexible of Kinect, to play with the curvature of location of the cameras and the three-dimensional position to see how this would help determinr.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Does it not seem to him that, from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of increased reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?</seg>

<seg id="57">- Of course, to spend all the while sustaining at the top a smartphone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" increased reality when, in base of a cloud platform, you could pass from the glasses to the smartphone,</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are very personal devices, in that its force is (the private things only you it will be able to see them), but also its weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow him to work on virtual objects together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem in this idea that the critics usually indicate: there is not tactile answer!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands do not sit anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">Which answers does its group prepare for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my conferences often I say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between the man and the machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It registers the touch perfectly!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are orientated to provide these "images" with tangibility "in the air" really. For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where he finds the finger gives a similar sensation that one sits if somebody were blowing for him in the fingertips, but that sensation still is very weak.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets for the doll that influence the nervous completions of the fingers, this also a promising address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Has treaty of tricking to the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Making him think that he feels what it seems that he should feel in the moment in which he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- That is a good idea, yet we have not tried it.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here another challenge with which we will have to fight for a lot of time is hidden, how to make a person physically placed in a very reduced space think that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are working in the idea about the ribbons of moving, mobile platforms, as well as that of the gigantic balloons, (not as those of the gymnasiums) also.</seg>
<seg id="73">For now, to trick to the brain not easy result, it still has to be worked during many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is what makes the work attractive with the virtual reality for the investigators, who many things find in a state of total conception.</seg>

<seg id="1">Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Rosbalt" continues the "Vanguardism" project "of Saint Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens that they meet in front, to the vanguard of the art and of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="3">In this list of the best they find bright figures of the art and the scene of Saint Petersburg, whose achievements arrive beyond the city: often they find recognition in Europe without Russia knowing them at least.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">All the city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed of red above down, that he can meet near the Russian Museum, near the Garden of Summer or in meetings of fashion and openings.</seg>
<seg id="6">The frames of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of those story-tellers purely sociophilosophical of Saint Petersburg, creators of new mythology.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a representative diamond of the vanguardism of Saint Petersburg of the end of the eighties - beginning of the nineties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city arouses smiles in the inhabitants and lifts the state of mind to all of them.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, it took a barrel organ in its hands and converted in the organillero of Saint Petersburg, since it has matured to make that is so difficult paper, for its bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Kirill, why do you go dressed of red and not of yellow one or turquoise, for example, through the city?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and dedicate myself to the appearance and to the image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the red color is a commitment among the artist, the creators of images and the society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although in the society, all what is not a little grey sparks off aggressiveness and agitation of not at all good properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are directed to a conversation beginning.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - When did you understand that you had to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - In an exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.</seg>
<seg id="19">I realized that that was my path.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the wave of old not official artists had finished, and the new ones, free as me, were still misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="21">I did myself friend of artists of the new wave, with the posterior ones of which they ran the risk in Gaza Strip and Nevskiy, that it took To "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave already ran out.</seg>
<seg id="22">I sank in the theater for the clothes, the music of all the genres, but not for the letters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - And all this was joined in your Private Hospital of art... - For me it was important to find me in the cultural center of Saint Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to be brought together.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were not reforms, was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the Bohemian of Saint Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many appeared there: Noms, Jazz Tequila, I remind of the mode in which Schnur brought the project "The ear of Van Gogh".</seg>
<seg id="26">Schnur and its friends sang slight songs under phonogram, dressed tight trousers, among them it was the at present composer of fashion Igor Vdovin.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group started to be due live, it converted in "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg was an entertainer of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of its great race; the basic education and formation received it of us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Private Hospital of the Art.</seg>
<seg id="31">There went our employees and assiduous customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000, the enquiry was done in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was chosen I, like this it finished my culmination.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, the honesty and the culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In our times it is easy to make itself popular, but the culture and the popularity are separate. One can be popular but very little cultivated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - There is something recognizable in your works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - Many of my paints are hits, in them the present and the occurrence is expressed clearly.</seg>
<seg id="39">I am going to do a programmed exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns are a timeless category.</seg>
<seg id="41">I was sociable before, but to now be like this is painful and terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clowns everything is daubed and the tragedy is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="43">What is grotesque loves me, I have grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now to one they follow it for the clothes, orientating themselves in what is external, but not in the interior of the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">And, perhaps to that person hands must not be shaken even, but to let's spit to her in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the deceit will be eliminated when he changes clothes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - Not long ago we saw you in the paper of urban organillero. - A cultivated city must have a hero like this.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who better than I to be!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Well but, maybe can the commercial art be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, to have touch.</seg>
<seg id="52">We are being witnesses of the disintegration of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before the people were grouped together in groups, the Bohemians wanted a thing, the simpletons others.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now all have been divided up into microcommunities, it is difficult to please all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a note of a hundred dollars them all to like it.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now it has to be thought by whom you want to be liked.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - And in order to listen to Stas Mikhailov they arrive per thousands!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - Are going to see it the neglected ones, there the sex sphere-social. works</seg>
<seg id="60">And to a cultural event 300 people go, 10 a thousand never will come. As result, less management, less money, everything withers.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have my fans, the most important thing is not to trick them, not to waste what you have achieved.</seg>
<seg id="62">When it was young it did such frames that a collector the tapeworm hanged in the wall next to Falk and Larionov.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with paints, with which as a rule the people finish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often they confuse the concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say spiritual culture, consumable culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is not any culture in the consumption, that is another history.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of the culture of yesterday, grew under the example of artists that lived in the poverty and died in the poverty, refused the money only to paint frames.</seg>
<seg id="68">I am in favor of this culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, what is what Saint Petersburg lacks?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - Good experts in culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is a concept: civil servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all them can dedicate themselves to the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">When the kings were the correct ones everything was in another way, the kings did perhaps not understand very well the culture, but knew that it was necessary to maintain the correct experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow there are now very good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We have people in Saint Petersburg that well could be expert, but they are closed, because they need each other expert at a superior level that evaluate correctly to these and make them the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now the subjective personal taste is being successful.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all the modern art is accepted, there are some artists that have to look for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - What is Saint Petersburg for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - Saint Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">But on our stones it is difficult that the art grows.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need cultural ground and have now more writers than readers, this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there is a heap of people with curiosity that goes to exhibitions and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In our case, this class is tiny.</seg>
<seg id="84">We have to do that the art is fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project will be executed with a subsidy of Saint Petersburg.</seg>

<seg id="5">In order to preserve the humanity the main question is made: How to continue the sort in a position to weightlessness or in the same planet in reserve?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that there is little where to choose.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"These are Venus and Mars", the investigator says head of the Astronomical State Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if the conditions in Mars are better for the life, in the surface of Venus the temperature is of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">It can only be lived at great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in the space.</seg>

<seg id="13">Four generations of peas cultivated in orbit did not stand out in anything of the terrestrial varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards the baby animal of insects in the orbit, small flies of the fruit, the drosófilas came.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 quail eggs were sent to the space to prove how the embryo develops in a position to weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We obtain a normal chick as result.</seg>
<seg id="17">But afterwards they start the problems.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is in that this chick has to find support, must be maintained on its own feet and to start to be moved", explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As it did not find support, the chicks gave somersaults at random.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 hours in the newborns a total atrophy of the instincts occurred.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks did not react to the light not even to the sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And twice we get the chicks to be born, but afterwards leave it because it was impossible to work there with them", comments on Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in the space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Last time that one biological "mini-ark" flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 they will continue the experiments.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, in the biosatellite "Bion" sorts of a same sex will only travel.</seg>

<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space already with fetuses.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, it was not at all supernatural.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="35">The homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an adequate emotional fund.</seg>

<seg id="42">"After all, nobody has answered this question", comments on the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only after a year of the flight to the space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We are few, the astronauts for whom after long flights everything has worked out well are counted, and a healthy generation comes growing.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if it can be said more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", the cosmonaut pilot light, hero of the Soviet Union, summarizes hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">However, the humanity must look for some new ways in the biotechnology, in the radiological protection, in the creation of the artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The hidrolaboratorio of the Center of preparation of cosmonauts is an obligatory stage in the preparation for the flight.</seg>

<seg id="54">The small men-amphibian seem to confirm that the life in the earth rose up from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that the baby finds approximately 9 months in its mother in the amniotic liquid, for it will be it easier to the water to be gotten used afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because since the moment of the birth up to the moment of the first bath they spend only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is very little to forget something", says Marina Aksenova, instructor of swimming of newborns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In summary, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for the women the gravitation, the force of the gravity, is necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the weightlessness the muscles abdominal and of the pelvis are decrepitan very fast, the capacity of expulsion from the fetus comes down.</seg>
<seg id="60">Good, we omit that, trusting the action of stimulants for the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="61">Birth can be given, of course, in a special camera, this one will push it.</seg>
<seg id="62">"AND afterwards what?", Valeri Polyakov is done this original question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without the sensation of gravity, the organism does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">To a newborn in orbit is impossible to dress it with a special suit for trainings, as to the adults.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Simply he will be deprived of what is vital for him.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment that we are going to do together, when allowing the birth of a child in a strange atmosphere, will give rise to we bringing to the Earth to one disabled, to a totally unadapted person", foresees the head of the committee of bioethics of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">For now, the birth of children in the space is a theoretical question.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the system "svarc" has not come across the guilty politician</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the subject of public submissions, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a legislation of quality, although its application limps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Like this Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz, states it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what misses us", like this describes the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also arrive to similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As example of an incorrect practice, it mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on the paper, which is known as the system "svarc".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The first minister told recently the businessmen with inspectors that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not be troublesome. Then, is it prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be regulated somehow and if it forbids something, in that case, not even the prime minister can prevent the performance of the office that has the duty to carry out these controls nor to require duties", confirms Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the meeting of the control commission in the Congress of the Representatives, you talked about the common project between the Czech team and the German, within the framework of whom the legislation concerning to the public submissions was compared in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is it exactly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control that we start to carry out about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">This in simplified way: the European legislation regulates how the public submissions must be organized, to this it follows it the current legislation in every country and, afterwards, the praxis in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have joined everything and, although the control yet has not finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the specific praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is confirmed, then, that it is not enough to incorporate rules every time stricter, but it is necessary to concentrate on the law enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What can provide in fact this project? Which does he think are the conclusions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Precisely a common control of this type could contribute towards our stopping inverting efforts in the concretion of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economics of the saving means obtaining one sews adapted to a fair price (what not always means that the price is the lowest) to prevent like this the enrichment and, eventually, the criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not for reducing the limit of the awards it means that we are going to obtain it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those that want to look for failures in the system will be able to make it more easily than if the limits remained as high as now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prácticaa of the public submissions.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of controls work in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or does organize itself in another way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In that how much to the offices, as the NKÚ, there also acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a way one so much different, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the competences are up to a certain analógas point, however, since Germany has a federal organization, the account courts are even at this level. In this aspect it differs slightly from our system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control the federal money, which calls state funds here.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds, which are administered by the regions and the municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Accounts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the local legislation, is it simpler than ours does?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">As a rule, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany keeps being a model in some aspects, but it cannot be needed with exactitude in what it is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Could it be better, for example, as for the quality of the inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That safe than, but, I repeat, I does not like to do this type of comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take for model must face a great number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">If it were not like this, it would not mean any profit to them to collaborate with our office, does he not believe?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As for the legislation of our country, what meant the law amendment for its Office on the public submissions? Does its incidence appear somehow?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment it is relatively short, it has not demonstrated yet in the control performances.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we carry out controls ex post, it is necessary to have a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of the future controls: we have initiated a new tool of "detection of not economic risks", for which we have made 14,000 public submissions, which have been analyzed, pass almost. The changes will be seen perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Does he consider that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it means a confusion for the bureaucratic system?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is probably a step in the correct address and I expect it like this to be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise is that the norm "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.</seg>
<seg id="40">The controlled people were, already with the previous norm, linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operative programs of the regional board of advice), and every law not respected on the subject of public submissions meant the violation of the budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Makes sense then to harden the law this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I believe that not this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those that want to attack it or to take advantage of it and not punish those that commit a formal failure, which does not have incidence in the decision making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">A system of this type will only manage to create a bigger bureaucratic pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how does it go out from this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We will see where it takes this initiated path to us.</seg>
<seg id="47">The first minister has declared recently that the ODS would not bother the businessmen with controls of the called svarc system, with regard to the fact that it was autonomous only on the paper. What means this?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is "the svarc system" prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be regulated somehow and, if it forbids something, not even the first minister of the government can then prevent the performance of the Office that has the duty to carry out these controls and to demand duties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: "We change the law and allow it", but cannot say that we will do as if nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the law on the public submissions, the norm is quite strict as for the mode in which people must act formally. And this is how it must be public to protect the competence.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer because it does not comply with the formal demands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is said that in little less than one month is going to arrive the end of the world, what does he opine on that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is only one out of so much other alarmist news that, which, like to grab each other.</seg>
<seg id="4">The group of music The Tap Tap rather likes us to do jokes on this and we like to say that we are the only group of music of the world that manages to bring sufficient positive energy together to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Besides, in December you really organize a project original: three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can it explain it to our readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a charitable state act that we have been planning since two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decide to make use of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for the 21st of December to the 11:10 of the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the previous day, on the 20th of December at 21 o'clock, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will finish approximately at the same hour in which it finishes the Mayan calendar in the Kiribati island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours in front of our hourly area.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To whom did this idea occur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At first it was my idea, afterwards we all kept forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides wanting to bring sufficient positive energy together and to prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags exchanges and key ring originals against the end of the world that can be acquired in www.e-tap.cz, another way of supporting us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The Tap Tap, together with other interpreters, also sang the called hymn against the end of the world, which is entitled "End of the world, canceled".</seg>
<seg id="16">At present it is very popular in YouTube, will it be able to be heard in the charitable concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Clear that yes, and the last one will be exactly, good, as long as everything comes out well and the world does not run out...</seg>
<seg id="18">All the interpreters will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hymns will be linked among themselves simultaneously thanks to the special retransmission live in the Czech Television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Tomás Hanák has written the letter of this song and protagonist of Jesus interprets the paper in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did this collaboration rise up?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable acts and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We put all our determination in taking part in this project.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has been proved that it interests most of them and it amuses them to work with us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world be destined for?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we take to term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pupils of the school of Jedličkův ústav receive regularly the visit of teachers with whom they carry out amusing and interesting activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pupils do not have sufficient economic means to pay the teachers and we make an efuerzo to make it possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">Within the framework of the ending of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In every concert several groups and interpreters act.</seg>
<seg id="31">Which are the criteria of selection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We try to elaborate a program that is an appeal for all the generations, the children included.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, will act Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">In order to obtain more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Do you plan any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we, Pražské jaro, will act for the first time in the festival, so we will here probably prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">The year that he comes also we would like to be due in the Bohemian National Hall of New York and I, personally, taking advantage of our being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, until now you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disability.</seg>
<seg id="40">How is it the logistics and the organization of these journeys?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not so difficult how it can seem at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">There are five members in electrical wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the compartment for luggages and besides we take a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, until now we have fixed them to ourselves well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly preparations, thing that does not stop surprising me.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, of where we have gone back not long ago, everything came out troublefree.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the exits you can compare the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled ones and other aspects to the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="46">What have you found until now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, in the east, a lot of path remains because it goes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it keeps not being frequent that a person is displaced by the town center in an electrical wheelchair alone.</seg>
<seg id="49">Is not, something as ordinary as it is, for example, to give somebody preference in wheelchair in elevator, there.</seg>
<seg id="50">For luck, has been created a civil association that makes an effort for tematizar the problems of the people with disability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In which aspects must we take example of more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many aspects in those that go at the back...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the perfection and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people that it affects directly.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and in Madrid it is very normal that the people with a severe disability move for its account in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where it wants...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not very common that a great number of people with disability take part in the social life in an active way, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap we go a little in front!</seg>
<seg id="56">A society respectful or without barriers is a thing, but she when it arrives the moment in which eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers rise up, will really start to change everything.</seg>
<seg id="57">Until now, they are cases isolated from people who have a great will power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group The Tap Tap is at present very popular, but if we look some years behind, what led you to form the group in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered as educator in Jedličkův ústav, where it had many young people around me that they wanted to dedicate themselves to something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am musical, I touch, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateurish group with a work colleague.</seg>
<seg id="61">And with time, as our moderator says Láďa Angelovič, a little lost us controls (laughters).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">However, the popularity did not arrive until these last years, or do I make a mistake?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is truth which the fact that it connected with famous singers and it also worked actively to promote the group helped us quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="64">We arrive to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the helps of the European Union, we can allow ourselves teaching staff of quality, equipment, etc besides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Did you have intention of arriving so far with The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the principle I saw the potential that there was, which can be done something in another way.</seg>
<seg id="68">The show business is full of things that are seemed the some ones to the other ones.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical, to its way, all what is new is received with caution and takes it a lot of time to be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The impression of somebody that sees us for the first time is clearly the pity, is a natural reaction...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is totally superfluous because the people with disability are not neglected beings who suffer and of which we must have pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who are capable of living a full life and developing, with the condition, of course, that it has the necessary means.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if something comes out well for them to people with disability, then, it is not only one advance for them, but for all the society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Did the fact that you are a demanding head, as he describes him many people, help?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do a work of quality, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and to require a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that it is completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when they find out that have to go two days to rehearse, to go to the preparatory test and to pass a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">But like this it is, in every group that it wants to work and to obtain something, how it works everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At present the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were already in the beginnings of the year 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, the people enter and goes out, cannot be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="84">The one who has will and desires will always find the open doors</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians will share the Czech Republic</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening party through video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The goal of the concert is to bring the necessary resources together to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational center without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav of Prague, whose cost rises at 25 million Czech crowns.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the meeting of ministers of the countries of the Space Agency European last week celebrated was accepted to Poland as twelfth member of the THAT ONE. It is the second member country of the THAT ONE of the old block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which was converted in full member on 12 of November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland initiated an intense collaboration with the THAT ONE in the year 1994 and during the posterior years it took part in the commission of projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the path of Poland towards the cosmos started a lot before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Polish enthusiasts already dedicated themselves to the flights to the space before the Second World War, although its work was not always understood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Memory, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in the one that, on 6 of December 1933, presented its ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to the cosmonautics".</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas about the young engineer (1905 born) left to the indifferent assistants and, years afterwards, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one that had shown interest in its work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the year 1934 Šternfeld obtained the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in France for its "Introduction to the cosmonautics".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned previously, converted later in a great instigator of the astronomy and of the cosmonautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski converted in a promoter of the cosmonautics, it was known in all the world and its contribution to the science was seen recompensed when its name was put at one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">A track car that was going to be provided with an engine of rockets was already in the year 1925 built in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Regrettably, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the dewaists of the project are not known either.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear if the rocket was going to be used for the starter of the track car or for its braking.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information on this track car is limited to the collection in the press of the period.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the year 1933 the Polish artillery started to be dedicated to the missiles.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was financed by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the preserved material, it is done evident that the research arrived to the stadium of the practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, with the arrival of the German troops, the research was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the year 1937 the prototype of a missile of photoelectric fighter designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the technical press and the following year the study "Rakieta" was published "- torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were destined for the military use of the engines for missiles.</seg>
<seg id="22">Little before the war, the temporary scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all the projects of techniques of missiles for military use and coordinated all the works.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but it after two years of activity, was seen interrupted by the beginning of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">In the edition of November of 1954 of the magazine Problemy is done reference for the first time to the society with four very lengthy articles dedicated themselves to the astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, of the prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a society that would dedicate itself to the cosmonautics was suggested.</seg>
<seg id="27">In that period projects of artificial satellites had already been started off and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with perspectives of future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in fall of that same year the PTA converted in full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), passed to to be the vice-president of the Federation International of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">It held this charge up to its death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956, the PTA shared significant way in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and converted in the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first RM-1 type was finished in 1957 and was launched by first time on the 10th of October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 linear cm and did not arrive at the 5 weighty kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, the version RM finished being built-1 A and in summer of 1959 the air tests of the RM-2 rockets of two stages began in the desert of Błędów.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another type of rocket in development was going to be the target of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the height wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962 the works were suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was designed as rocket of two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three types were developed (called Meteor-1 A, --1B and -1 C), that they stood out among themselves for the amount of space available for the scientific devices.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the rocket Meteor-1 A the amount of space available for the volume was of 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1 C of 0.62 liters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum apogee in the three types was of 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between the years 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first air tests began in October 1970, developed in the Air Institute.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of taking a working load of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later the version Meteor was built-2 H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is necessary to mention also the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Within the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland joined the research of the outer space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in the year 1978, the Polish pilot light Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The suspension of the law on social works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week the constitutional court suspended the traabajos law social.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution aroused a heated discussion in the society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course it will be interesting to examine the existing issue from a wider point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, they base on the principle of a bigger economic competition and less norm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and the national economic systems are in permanent conflict among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause is in the principle of the free trade and of the free and unlimited movement of capital deprived, together with the wild financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The effect of the great differences in the work cost (of the salaries) produces economic tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap merchandise, tries to shorten distances and for that "it provokes a bajadda" of the price of the competitor with the aim of getting hold of most of the market and, in this way, increasing its margin of profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">At a large scale a large scale it means, for most of the businessmen, to transfer the production abroad, to buy there cheaper or else to disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries in which the price of the work, in comparison with other economics, is higher.</seg>
<seg id="11">That the private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with that, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates either, the social expense of the state grows necessarily.</seg>
<seg id="12">All this situation favors the total disinterest of the businessmen because they pay taxes and compensate the economic and social damages that they have provoked in its eagerness to obtain profits.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is universally so known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The little scrupulous practices of the private capital create situations, in specific economics, in which the governments of these countries are seen obliged to competing with the aim of reducing artificially the social standard of the population itself and, in this way, attracting foreign capital to the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">This in another way, the governments make private capital available to its own population without taking the social decline into account.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is made obvious especially in the changes of the laws in force.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to oblige the population that it accepts the dictation of the private capital, especially as for the salaries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic duty in the case of longstanding unemployment; for another, through the restricted law of the employees as for work rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is an increasing poverty together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since a series of years ago, there are in Germany points of delivery of foods for poor people who cannot keep with its own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people who receive this type of help already arrives per million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within the framework of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economics, a quite frequent case takes place: people employed with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to arrive to the at the minimum essential one to survive.</seg>
<seg id="23">A scandal of this related type was made public with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The measures of saving practically of all the states of the south of the EU lead, no doubt, to the same situation. The people, pressed by an abysmal decline of its social standard, see themselves obliged to to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live badly with a crummy salary in the limit of the society, with the hope that some day it arrives to the private investing capital country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Is it necessary preguntrarse from where it comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">In the case that it is about other countries of the EU, then the poverty passes of a country to another or does ever not arrive, since Chinese, Brazilian Indians, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptians or Africans keep working for a tiny part of a European salary.</seg>
<seg id="27">This also affects all Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theories and the media state up to the satiety that the state should not provide capital to the economics, that to direct the economics drives to its failure.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not take part in the economics interfering with the control.</seg>
<seg id="30">Next, it is necessary to wonder if the private capital is not influential with its egoism in the political march and, therefore, in all the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.</seg>
<seg id="32">The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all the states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation that appears in the area of the corruption, in the mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is the following one: the state ministries, for lack of financial circles, order the writing of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">This type of bills are approved afterwards in the Bundestag, the German parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">This way, all the power does not emanate from the people, as it is announced in the constitutions of the occidental democracies, but of the strong financial groups that they represent its own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the democracies with a liberal orientation are found quickly in a situation how the one that describes Appiános in its work La crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeya: "The state took time disintegrating and the administrations were occupied by force".</seg>
<seg id="38">In exchange for bribery, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">The bribery and the corruption extended without any impediment and the people went to the urns with the vote agreed on beforehand"... "there were not people with character that it inhaled at a post in the administration, so once, because of this lack of organization, the state was eight months without consuls..." "People started to talk seriously about the only remedy for such a severe situation being the autocracy and it being necessary to choose a vigorous man"... Although Appiános thought in Pompeya, Caesar came to power and transformed the democracy forever into autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion, in the same way that in the antiquity, is that the current society bases itself on inconsiderate preferences of the individual profit without taking the common interests into account.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the profits for all the society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is it as that of then, a decadence of the elite without precedents, without an effort being carried out to reform it in depth, is.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causes of the apogee of the fascist and communist regimes must be searched, therefore, in the wild liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th century and XX.</seg>
<seg id="44">With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider, as a defined pause, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a democracy of liberal type waiting for the next knock.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact really demolishing is that the current elite is unaware of the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes of which we have been witnesses, as well as the crimes against humanity, completely as we know them in the old history and the most recent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The suspension of the law on public submissions is not the solution; at least not to long deadline.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure of the economic competition, so much at international level as in the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be seen obliged to keeping looking for other ways to reduce the social standard of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is, therefore, systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution happens by specific sociopolitical reforms, which reinforce the participation of the capital of the state as well as the influence of the citizens in the government and which weaken the position of monopoly of the private capital in the society for the benefit of the state.</seg>

The other one supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and defect to Israel of terrorist state.</seg>
<seg id="6">I do not want to center me in whom it is guilty of the killings that are periodically repeated and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of nowadays of Israel, once the autonomous territories had been included, were born in the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">My intention is to offer a look to the readers behind the curtain, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that are dragged since 95 years ago (calculated from the declaration Balfour in November 1917) in a small earth surface of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in conclusions to which I have arrived on the base in my own way of understanding the matter, on whom or what group of people is the main instigator of the events of the modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the history of the humanity the history of the fights for the power is in first row.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every period we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">But what is not so evident any longer is if those that managed its steps autonomously were always these characters or if behind its throne there was somebody who orientated its actions towards a specific goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must accept that we live in a period that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, have not been able to be reached in a single generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Out of these astronomically rich families it highlights one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still somebody behind, I do not know it, but I do not discard it): the Rothschild.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not written a lot to near them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Naturally.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the nineties of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that they stopped associating its name with criminal acts of a lot of gravity. The power and the wealth, or they both, covered the backs, thing that for them always meant a strengthening, for them.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have important participations almost in all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, it has broken out or a war is being prepared: before the attack to Afghanistan they were 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq they were 5, after only bringing down to Gadafi four remained, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.</seg>
<seg id="18">All that one has died that it has tried to be opposed to this family.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renewing the state of the central bank Bank of America de los Rothschild, started during the Secession War to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK started to print money and wanted to suspend the federal standby system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; the congress man Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in the year 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered off the great economic crisis of the year 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Its eagerness for the world power took them during the years 1859 - 1871 to outline a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, honored with the degree 33.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was marked as I objectivize to eliminate the great monarchical states in all Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (similar quantity of slaves for his welfare and luxury would be enough and they would not consume so many resources), besides the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenism is not anything more than a preliminary plan for similar solution is) and the definite adoption of the absolute powers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method with which he operates on the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the crisis gating and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are, however, wrong, and always entail a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis as that of the year 1907 was not repeated.</seg>
<seg id="25">So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after, as a result of that, it broke out the First world war, destroyed the tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War finished, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to finish with the tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire, in a sudden and unjustified way from the military and economic point of view.</seg>
<seg id="27">In order to prepare the ground of the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a hidden way, a troublesome situation as a result of the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, so the optimal conditions were created for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Later, it was enough for them to serve the solution of the Führer, who was strong enough and simple and indicated to guilty, to the Germans, and to build afterwards a Czechoslovakia composed by several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, that it fastened the flame and provoked the outburst of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">To the final of the 19th century, the Rothschild gave impulse to the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the former Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The declaration Balfour mentioned previously laid the foundations for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and they started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks took place in both parts.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know if Hitler pulled too much the string to the one that had it tied the international bankers at first or if all what he made was part of a plan. However, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was founded officially in 1948 and, in a way similar to the mode in which the war repairs imposed on Germany leveled the path towards the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers managed to initiate her, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would turn into victim in first line of combat, now together with the population Arab or, generally, Muslim of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also at an international scale. We take as example how the sympathizers and opponents of Israel are divided up sharply.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does the injustice produce injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything the greed of some individuals and its eagerness for the world power was?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this point it is necessary to distinguish among the inhabitants of Israel and its leaders, because, the same as it succeeds in our country, the international bankers alone present to its candidates in the choices.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, that everything possible to declare the war To Iran ago and, considering that Iran is a member of the Organization of Cooperation of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten in being converted in a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the strait of Ormuz, for where it passes 20% of all the world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles of width), it would lead to the destruction of the world economics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Under which light are the words that David Rockefeller pronounced in 1994 shown now: "The only thing that we need is a general crisis and the people will agree with a new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in its imagination is a world of misters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world in which the rest of the population acts at a handful of people who are part of the well adapted financial aristocracy.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world in which a chip is implanted for every new individual when appearing that controls everything his to be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Film Argo: If it puts raw, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 a group of the demonstration of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 holders of a diploma as hostages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Its release was going to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, that after the revolution ran away to EE.UU, country that had sponsored its regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the shah overboard could not allow it to him, since, if he made it, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not to its scope.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a knock to the prestige of the United States, which later still intensified more with the unsuccessful attempt to release the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the US., its destination caused a wave of solidarity and hostility against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="9">The failure in Iran contributed decisively Ronald Reagan to the defeat of Jimmy Carter front in the presidential choices of 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film "Argo" of the director and actor Ben Affleck tematiza an episode of this history, who harvested a small success for America.</seg>
<seg id="11">Little before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a complicated journey, they finished in the residence of the Canadian embassy.</seg>
<seg id="13">CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, it managed to take them of Iran, for that an extravagant point helped a hidden history: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of an overproduction of science fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan that the expert in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez outlined required the collaboration of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that the lie seemed true, it was written on the cinematographic project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the society of fictitious production had even a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details on the operation kept in secret for a lot of time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film of Affleck is a singular combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; for another, a called "caper movie", the history of an episode that came out well, a deceit (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film the states of mind are combined. On the one hand we find sequences well documented of Tehran. In the sequence of credits emblematic photographs of the period of the events, which were represented in the same way in the film, are shown; there are not many differences about this.</seg>
<seg id="21">For the other one, typical scenes of Hollywood a tanto lighter, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And besides, scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions: men well dressed who analyze the situation in the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed to resume its race in an excellent way.</seg>
<seg id="24">The actor, who had been the target of mockeries, has been converted in a respectable director and its mode of acting has stopped being the white of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is its third feature film, after "Good-Bye small, Good-Bye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.</seg>
<seg id="27">Likewise, the sensitivity of collecting the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that situated the directors of old films above standards of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran "is filmed" in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the disturbance and of the lack of forecast that rises up when, in some place, the history takes a step ahead.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and its collaborators obtain a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the impostor team in the bazaar of Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to accept the fact that an explained history does not offer a lot in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">And it fixes them quite well for him. Sometimes he adds something for him to the reality: here everything does not come out in a way that is so elegant (the scene in which it stalks the crisis in the airport of Tehran, the deviation of a call to America and the search let loose after its track turn into a madness).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that rises up from the need to show too much action in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very cute paper as collaborators of Hollywood, although its characters deserved more space and are, by no means, the only ones in this film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For these reasons, the film of Affleck loses a little dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, to value its carrying out and the retro style of a thriller that it evokes the seventies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that it is brought down, that will be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">As evocation of a real history and as test of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence can be and omniscience of the secret services, it is sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules for the one inflated of balloons, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who every year presents an enquiry on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas about the workshop of the EU".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"It happened us after the last event, the EU plans on approving a fee of 40 per cent of women in address posts in the European big businesses", explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the enquiry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominating absurdities the recent decision of the European court of unifying the insurance policies is, for example, between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, the women were excelled of better prices in the life insurances because they represent objectively a smaller risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Other incredible ideas about the workshop of the EU can be suggested by the people up to the end of this year".</seg>
<seg id="7">The choice will take place at the end of the month of February 2013", informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel that, as result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of the mercury bulb thermometers of all the life only because a small quantity of a dangerous good or the sombre guideline contain the size of the cages of the hens, which it has contributed to the considerable increase of the price of the eggs this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The factic prohibition of using the expression "butter of covering" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb of the trades has been criticized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The device of the Union takes this type of decisions often under the pressure of one or another mercantile or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the bananas of biggest quality had to have a length in the EU of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "abnormal curvatures".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission was defended saying that with this she only looks for blending the national norms not homogenized up to the date, which only complicated its commercialization.</seg>
<seg id="14">The norms that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, in spite of the opposition of some states, have been softened on the base that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate to gain the enquiry could be the prescription of the EU of the last year according to which in the inflatable balloons that are marketed it is obligatory to warn that the children younger than 8 years are not authorized to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU referred here to an American study according to which, when it is spoken of toys, the balloons are the main cause of infantile death for suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction applicable to the use of party blower is also current on the part of children of until 14 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Curious occurrences appear even in our country</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Equally absurdity is the regulation concerning to the European civil servants: any one that has some official function in the EU cannot use the denomination of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, it must be spoken of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Laissez Faire association of liberal economists, nominated the prescription of the Union in the enquiry, among some absurd proposals mentioned more above, on the volume of the provisions of foods in the territory of a member state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU determined the maximum volumes of provisions of foods that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic the same day of our entry to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">Afterwards, the Czech Republic surpassed, for example, the volume established for mushrooms in preserve, which meant a threat of substantial fine to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The occurrence of paying those countries that do not have right of acces and the idea about granting a subsidy for the application for subsidies also interested the organizers of the enquiry.</seg>
<seg id="24">This one class of ideas did not rise in Brussels but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are in disadvantage for not having sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We request from the European Union a compensation", declared in fall of 2004 the then minister of agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">He argued it with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as consequence of the called intervention purchases, the state had the full stores and it had to be exported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the sea harbors, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission appeared ready-disposed to help the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of the cereal of the countries that do not have right of acces.</seg>
<seg id="30">The subsidy to receive a subsidy was suggested to the municipalities by the ministry for the local development directed by the minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Precisely, it is destined for the writing of applications of subsidies of Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: The strange prescriptions are an exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The guidelines of the member states are often white of critical, the efforts of the EU on the subject of regulations and, likewise, a more effective functioning and development in all the Union rather deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to the experts, the most severe problem is, for example, the payment of subsidies of the EU for projects that do not have anything to do with the deepening of the European integration, but that the member states have obtained in the negotiations on budgets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">To the Czechs it also touches the sensitive fibre, in the same way that to other countries of the Union, the fight for the right to the denomination of origin of its traditional products, even if our country has not always gone out of these fights victorious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, defended successfully the denomination of origin of the cottage cheese of Olomouc, but they had to change the name with the national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and it happened to be called "tuzemák".</seg>
<seg id="36">Only the manufactured goods from the distillate of sugar cane can be named rum, but not those facts from sugar beetroot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official listing of denominations of origin protected from the EU, together with the feta cheeses and gorgonzola known in all the world, the marzipan paste of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, they already find for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the marquee of Pohořelice and of Třeboň and, even, the variety of hop of Žatec.</seg>
<seg id="38">As gangs protected from the EU, they will be able to be proud of the the bread of ginger of Pardubice and the wafers of Hořice v Podkrkonosí.</seg>

<seg id="1">The people want it to save the republic, but am an amateur, states Okamura</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mister senator, how did it happen to him to present itself to the choices for president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is not a matter of being senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If in our country it were everything well, it would then not present my candidature.</seg>
<seg id="5">But any longer I cannot stand seeing how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how the thieves remain unpunished, the taxes and the pensionable age are increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">It did not have ambitions of being political.</seg>
<seg id="7">When I see something that does not like me, attempt to come across a solution to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I already have forty years and my candidature is independent, the only possibility that I have of changing the things is to introduce me as senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It has already reached the Senate, but it has set little afterwards in path towards the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="10">Is he not turning the back on those people who have voted it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I always said that my candidature to the presidency depended on the results in the choices of the senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I needed if chosen senator went out, him to present my candidature to the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can bring about my own ideas.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's why I need the biggest possible influence and the possible strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not alone that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but we trample on any that wants to initiate a change.</seg>
<seg id="16">The media, which discredit for you and confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom of lying, are added for him to this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of me it is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor of Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We are going to talk about its ideas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is presented to the presidential fight with financial theses and penal responsibilities of politicians and to the declaration of the property above twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that it must change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president it does not have this competence and only the senate in its ensemble can suggest laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How does he want to solve it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the profession of guide was recognized as autonomous work, and we obtain it.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is in the policy: if somebody arrives with a good proposal, either right-wing or left-wing, it is refused intentionally and this affects the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As independent candidate, I have a bigger potential to obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups.</seg>
<seg id="26">Without encasillamientos nor dogmas of party, I have the capacity to be able to choose something of every party that is better for our country and to apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Is a right-wing or left-wing man rather considered?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people consider more left-wing for me.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it is not important, either a little left-wing or a little right-wing.</seg>
<seg id="30">What is important to me is that we get through.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is not me important if anybody is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always support openly any good solution, independently of whether the proposal comes of the KSČM or of the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">He does joke when it is said of you who are populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But is it not proving it with what it says?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When he thinks a business plan for the company, you have also certain goals and ideals.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you try to approach them.</seg>
<seg id="37">There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals of those that I already speak work in the world or expert acquaintances talk about them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of the parliament it only has orders.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that it cannot survive in the long-term policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that if you go to the people and talk with them, you will obtain, for example, a penal and financial responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I do not have another option.</seg>
<seg id="42">Convincing to politicians, to journalists and to the civil society and to try to put them of my part to obtain it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If were chosen president, there would not be problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which it would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties for penitentiary and financing company for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors of the state to legitimize the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="44">And eventually, they should communicate cause do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong character who indicates the disputes, pressure can be done in the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Let's take for case the direct choice of the president, who has been an achievement of the public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time I state that I am only an amateur, I am not either a genius or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">I have just started in the policy and attempt to obtain the biggest possible support for my program.</seg>
<seg id="50">Attempt to get the things off the ground I myself, but if it does not come out well, in six years I will leave it and will return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">A little sounds as if Okamura went to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not any savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that with a person I do not do anything, that's why I have visited a series of personalities known, for whether maybe they decided to present its candidature to the senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to see Radim Jančura, but he said no because it had a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">On my part, I have at least supported the journalist of research Jana Lorencová, who brought the frauds with thin oils of heating to light.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I presented setting off of the base that the people are unsatisfied really, now I am on the scale.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the urns and, those that made it, voted the representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the senate we are two of the independent sector.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people chose the senate, so that it will be complicated to achieve changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, I will defend my own ideas, as for example the direct choice of mayors or of governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Is he considering to form its own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not considered it yet because I do not have time for that, to check the irreproachable past of each of the potential members of the party, and do not have money either.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do not have money nor for the campaign to the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Does it not have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">It talks of declarations of the property, how is it his?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I rate my private property at about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a ground valued at 25 million, a flat valued ten million, another flat priced at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at a million, and at the account I have a couple of millions.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. James Bond, who drove this car always liked me, was gallant with the women and, at the same time, fought against the wickedness and injustices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Does it drive an Aston Martin, is its property valued at 60 million and does it not have money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic but you do not want to put too much money of its part.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Do I have to become indebted?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that it does not have any sponsor proves that there is not too much interest in my program.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I do not have the duty to pay the campaign with money of my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">The expenses of the campaign cover in essence what I will receive in concept of salary of senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But he could not live of that. For example, he could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 monthly crowns.</seg>
<seg id="79">If he wanted to gain only money, I would then not present myself as candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So will it continue with its company activity to be able to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Has he not said before that he was going to leave this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This does not have anything to do with a bigger salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I have been promising, I have partially left my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the representative of my travel agency will pass to be my substitute in spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people would want for him to be the Samaritan who overcame the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to live of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much does he usually gain monthly as businessman?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep gaining.</seg>
<seg id="89">If he were a president, he would then leave the businesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">He can consult all the interview in the edition of Saturday of Práva.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The study of architecture MVRDV proves that the real adventures not alone are in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly finished "mountain of books" - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I believe that the building is amused, has a futuristic aspect, and at last there is something interesting to see", states Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by that passes through the street.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, technician of YOU in a big business situated near the library, registers: "besides, the building is pretty".</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder for what we need a library nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="5">We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nobody enters those old-fashioned libraries for taste, not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a dormitory town situated at the doors of Róterdam that a fleeting visit hardly deserves, holds the doubtful honor of having raised with a record to forget.</seg>
<seg id="8">The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the lower rate of education of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to counteract this situation that was so shameful, it was decided some years ago to contribute somehow to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges that they appear represented in the notes of euro in the form of decorated miniatures of reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">And like this it was as the responsible politicians decided that alone existed a possibility to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas, of the Dutch study of architecture MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of the bar charts and responsible for buildings amused at the same time that cynical, the subject with its usual serenity was taken and appeared to the presentation of the competition in the year 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury looked perplexed around you and shrugged, Maas proceeded to pile the books for size up forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the following words: "Fellow citizens estimated:</seg>
<seg id="14">Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the named `Boekenberg' ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years afterwards, the mountain of 30 million euros is lifted in the planned place.</seg>
<seg id="16">This one is part of the project of revitalization, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of house buildings and semi-detached houses.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">Besides, the project is also nominating to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This way, the small city lacking in history, that up to the date did not have anything more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town council after whose white façade one it would rather sense a milk headquarters, has now a work of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But especially, Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of its history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long path up to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese maker.</seg>
<seg id="23">Well it is true that there is an elevator that transports us exactly to the center of this mountainous massif, but the real lovers of the space and the reading do not use it, but melting with its topography to every step of its climbing to the summit is preferred.</seg>
<seg id="24">The completely glazed interior is luminous and easy to cover with the view, the ground of overcooked brick and the elegant street lamps support unmistakably the public condition of the library.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban atmosphere is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">When raising the view the banks of the park, the dogs and the children and girls can get to be viewed playing the soccer.</seg>
<seg id="27">AND for all book sides, books and more books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the book shelves are willing along the façade and in the center an enormous dark room is opened that, as a rule, is usually a little uncomfortable and impersonal", states Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">What we have made is to put the classic space configuration upside down and to take the area of reading of the interior out for the exterior.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain is very well made use of: in the middle they find the offices, the library of Internet, the club of chess, the center of environmental education and the room of maintenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of mural coating, parapet and banister at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="32">The view, the touch and the sense of smell are strange.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the architects and the civil engineers per day shake the head more when they hear to talk about this unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse, to us.</seg>
<seg id="35">And this is how a day, in a Frisian farm, we run into the adequate by-product proceeding from the agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since many years ago, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands a plastic fabric of scarce millimeters of thickness as base is used to hold the roots of the crops.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a cheap and efficient material.</seg>
<seg id="38">This fine fabric lasts two stations and afterwards it is discarded.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library this fabric was pressed, by first time in such quantities, until it obtained sheets of four centimeters of thickness.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the heat and the pressure, the named agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and converts in a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a mixture of new car and training shoe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps people arrive to the summit of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain the reward awaits us: from the café not alone is had a fantastic view of the city, but in it some tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in enormous plant-pots can also be enjoyed.</seg>
<seg id="43">These create a nice atmosphere at the same time that they maintain the adequate atmospheric moisture for this literature mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for one new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Even if it is difficult to believe it given its glazed hypermarkets, this building is an exemplary project as for the ecology", indicates Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The necessary heating and refrigeration are obtained from geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Even though the mountain of books is situated under an enormous crystal pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun alone shines during few hours in its interior.</seg>
<seg id="48">The enormous wooden cerchas situated in transverse direction at the crystal façade are used for giving shadow and absorb most of the rays of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="49">This creates a comfortable interior climate.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest is a thing of the automatic venitian shutters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker of the sector of the Information Technologies, has already dared to put the foot in the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Equally, the teacher of Chinese traditional medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason is that, for the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of its private collection were invited.</seg>
<seg id="55">This way it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical hollows of a library that it does not count yet with its complete file; at present it has 70,000 copies.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has sunk deep.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are full.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is not anything worse that an empty means library", states the architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.</seg>
<seg id="60">They know all that its book is part of the library.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although alone is there to adorn.</seg>
<seg id="62">This way, the study MVRDV has obtained a whole success in that discipline queen that in the specialized jargon is known as "creation of an identity".</seg>
<seg id="63">The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">Independently of the young and uneducated that can be.</seg>
<seg id="65">At last a preliminary point to form its identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The Germans must play one paper more protagonist"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, expert in the relations EE. UU. -Europe, this situates Berlin in a quite tricky diplomatic position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany gave a hint that he would vote against the proposal of granting the condition of observant State of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.</seg>
<seg id="5">Finally, however, Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have made in Gaza Strip.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, due to the special relation that it joins to the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think that it does not back the North American posture up either.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical with Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the raising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when of what was treated one might have established an area of prohibition of flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally this one has been declared by the NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Does Germany find it difficult to take on a clear posture when important international subjects are at stake?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, like this it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is due to in these moments his being reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">And what still obstructs the things more is that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, the Germans are in an intersection.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of them it is expected them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to make it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think that they are still sizing up which will be its paper, but have already initiated the path towards a "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A similar foreign policy to the countries as France or Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What means precisely a "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is a policy that, when they are national interests, those of the United States or its European partners are shown different ready-disposed to defend postures.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that the German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in the economic policy, that is, in the exports and in its relations with specific regions, as they can be Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The German economic interests are up to a certain point different to those of other great powers and for that Germany reason it must protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Have these economic interests been influential in the posture adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand, Germany has big markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">For this reason it must be careful and not be alienated of the Arab public opinion even either of the Arab elites.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is important, of course.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not give him so much importance since it is not a totally unilateral relation.</seg>
<seg id="30">Yes, however, they play a basic paper in the German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Has hollowed out Germany its relation with EE. UU. when refraining from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German posture has an enormous degree of understanding.</seg>
<seg id="33">For this reason, I do not think that such a drastic breach has taken place as in the case of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps with that Germany has managed to earn a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all, all this has not done but to prove that it is a country to which they take seriously as international actor and whose interests have to be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, EE. UU. has been shown clearly in favor of a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is disparity of opinions between EE. UU. and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These disparities have always existed due to the American interior policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the government of Obama shows in secret one big understanding towards the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But, because of the political situation that is lived here, it is evident that the government cannot defend that posture in public.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that the real disparity of opinions does not have in fact the importance that is attributed to him.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we analyze the relations between Obama and the First Israeli Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for anything gotten excited with the policy that it develops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Does Germany find it difficult to combine the close relations that it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the posture of its main partners in the EU, for another?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that what makes it be so difficult for the Germans is precisely that.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course that it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a superior institution, but they must give impulse to the things from its own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is precisely what they are making now with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future Germany will assume a leadership paper at the time of obliging Europe to adopting a European posture.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course that this is not at all easy for Germany, it is already simply for the relation that maintains with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a thorny subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think that the Germans have clearing that must have the paper of independent figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">It sees Germany to itself in the paper of important international actor? Germany wants in fact to assume a paper protagonist?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or perhaps does it keep finding it difficult to accept that leadership?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not gotten yet used, it is always a little uncomfortable and, for evident reasons, it keeps being difficult for the country to play a more important paper.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we observe the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as main actor, certain anti-German feelings break out.</seg>
<seg id="57">This is not easy for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is an old problem and is that nobody wants to be surrounded of the countries hostile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Seen this way, Germany is in a position much more difficult than United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must show a receptive attitude in front of the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of EE. UU. in the European policy it decreases every time more, but the EU does not cover at the moment that emptiness, who remains then?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will not have more remedy to assume one paper more protagonist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if it does not please them, if it is them unpleasant or if it still converts them more unpopular in some people, c'est the vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani turn suddenly into Chinese brands</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a brand known at world level and Pole Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But, what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">After this name a denomination registered officially in China but that does not have anything to do with the original companies is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, this one has protection as long as the real eponyms do not present a demand.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear that they are going to be proved right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The foreigners find it every time more difficult to protect its brands in China", indicates Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the office Taylor Wessing specialized in violations of rights of protection in Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week a new case arrives to my table.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register its brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">This way, Gucci converts in Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.</seg>
<seg id="11">The German companies are also copied legally from the same way, as it has happened to the manufacturer of sport articles Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a file in which it puts seats of the office of brands of Peking away.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 of September 2010 a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also made use of the home of fashion Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That the Chinese are world champions in that of copying and of violating the rights of copyright is in excess known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively on sale of forgeries.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the cases of Pattloch are of another kind. To order of its customers, he fights against the fact that the office of brands grants officially to the Chinese companies the law to benefiting from a denomination that is already registered in another place.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese name it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",</seg>
<seg id="19">that it refers to women who "have caught" a rich man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is harmful to the business, has that fighting against that", requires Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand does waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage that suffers the image is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the procedural coasts of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in the case of emblematic products of luxury.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data of the company of market research CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euros per year China is, in size, the third market of articles of luxury and the one that grows to bigger rhythm.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, to achieve the annulment of inscriptions of doubtful legality in the register of brands is complicated and besides means a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="26">The processes can go on years up to nine and the result is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected a demand because it had gone by so much time that the object name of the demand already had turned into a "reality of market".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"If the plaintiff has bad luck, perhaps even it has to pay money to the plagiarizer because the process has damaged to the brand of this one in China ", indicates Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">On occasions this is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the best known cases have to see diagrams with elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 Daimler-Benz it lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of machinery of construction Sany, the company that has been taken over not long ago by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's why the Chinese can today keep using an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used at first a blank and blue logo of which it reminded to a large extent BMW; the matter was annulled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer of clothes Lacoste lost in China against imitators proceeding from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the address opposed to the original.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The office of brands CTMO in Peking recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.</seg>
<seg id="37">Last year, however, "the emergency work situation returned to the normality".</seg>
<seg id="38">This way, the quantity of processes of claim without carrying out has come down to 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57,000 of these cases were solved solved, 75% more that the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, 81,500 claims follow resolution slopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To fight against this is difficult a lot of money</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As it is usually usual in China, the ciphers are surprising.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of brands, almost one third more that in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It would be a new record and it means that China leads the list of new inscriptions in all the world for tenth consecutive year, as it indicates the office of brands.</seg>
<seg id="45">It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, cipher that rises at 5.5 million in total.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 they would have pocketed 1,800 million yuans in concept of rights.</seg>
<seg id="47">This in another way, this means that of average every inscription costs 1,280 yuans or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To fight against this is difficult a lot of money, as it proves the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since more than seven years ago the group fights in the courts against a Chinese imitator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Although the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of pieces of car of imitation,</seg>
<seg id="51">the imitator has managed to be assured the Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected", indicates Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The office of brands CTMO also rejected the resource of the muniqueses.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the two following applications they have proved Freudenberg right, but the opposing party keeps fighting at present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">People have to be very careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the case has arrived to the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where resolution slope continues.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler counts on being able to solve the question favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, so much in terms of money as of time".</seg>
<seg id="59">It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the business file has had to revise dossiers of years of antiquity up to a hundred to be able to bring forward tests.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago Freudenberg offered to the opposing party a "sum of six ciphers in euros" with the aim of coming to an agreement friendly, but it did not have success.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This proves how much imports us", indicates Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers that they stalk in Far East threaten even with affecting Europe,</seg>
<seg id="63">precisely if the imitators are fixed the rights there on not protected brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and products of skin in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="65">Does time that the group abandoned this commercial area, however it managed to prevent the inscription.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"Has to be been very careful", states Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He as well as the lawyer Pattloch recommend the German companies that they be extremely prudent at the time of doing businesses with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to trust the international legislation on branded rights, but what has to be made is to "register also in China all that that can be susceptible of protection", as he notes Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple register can.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of its particular battle, then it should pay to the opposing party rights of license for its own name, as it explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">That or in the segment in question they would expel us from the market.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">World day of the fight against Aids: dancing, to sing, to help</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg he rehearses the chorus Imbongi and in Swaziland the orphans of Aids cheer up</seg>
<seg id="3">The history of a capable link of which to surpass much more of 8,733 kilometers of distance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First it is started by the dance: boots of cowboy, slippers of basketball, court shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet ground, and find it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">One, two, three, four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Alone then start to the voices of the singers (short contralto, tenor and soprano) to be increased slowly, swirling, being obstructed and some being followed to others.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatens with going out almost of its boxes when trying to put order with his gestures vigorous and soft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday in the afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi rehearses a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fifty singers, of between 23 and 69 years, have also arrived from the human geneticist up to the housewife.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every voice of the chorus has a different text and besides a hardly known foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help for the self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to an estimation of ONUSIDA, the program of the United Nations for the fight against Aids, in all the world there are approximately 34 million people infected by the virus of the HIV.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million they live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans of Aids.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is more of 40% of the population already seropositive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 orphans of the Aids of the people of Esitjeni.</seg>
<seg id="17">Seventy of them attend the secondary school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros per month a child can be been godfather to.</seg>
<seg id="19">This contribution will cover the registration of the school, the uniform and will guarantee it a hot food to the day in the Gogo Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means "narrator of histories" or "panegyrist" in Zulu.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this room nobody knows how to talk with fluency this Bantu language, but to sing yes know.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since ten years ago this chorus rehearses songs in this soft foreign language that on occasions manages to transport them to its place of origin: the south of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">At 8,733 kilometers of distance in direct line line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there are some people called Esitjeni that depend on the voices of this German chorus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty per cent is infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud huts and straw, a great part of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 any longer they do not have fathers because they have succumbed to Aids.</seg>
<seg id="27">Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the higher rate of infection of Aids and the lowest life expectancy of all the world, according to Unicef.</seg>
<seg id="28">The population does not see with good eyes the circumcision, a practice that as it has been proved reduces the risk of infection to the half.</seg>
<seg id="29">More of 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are bearers of the virus of the immunodeficiency, and to die with something more than thirty years has been converted in a little usual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">During a joint journey to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered this hidden population, but what saw especially were many children in the streets that lacked not alone of the protection of its fathers, but of what is main: food, clothes and formation.</seg>
<seg id="31">Untitled schoolchild, the possibilities in a poor country are more that scarce.</seg>
<seg id="32">At first what it made possible that a child went to the school and enjoyed a hot food per day was only the particular commitment of a few. All this for a few euros.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, a year afterwards the chorus founded the association "Voices for Africa" that since then has been in charge of the orphans of the Aids in Esitjeni professionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts on the infections of sexual transmission</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Which are the main sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">Among the ETS of bacterial origin are the syphilis, the chlamydia and the gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="37">The ETS of viral origin most usual are Aids, the virus of the papilloma human being, the genital herpes or the hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The crab lice and the scabies are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Which are the main groups of affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">The syphilis and the gonorrhea occur with more frequency in men who maintain sexual intercourse with other men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute Robert Koch sets off from the base that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have its origin in a sexual intercourse among men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the case of the heterosexual adults the most usual sexually transmitted diseases are the infections for chlamydia, tricomonas, the virus of the papilloma human being, the candidiasis (fungus) and the gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="43">The infection of the HIV among the heterosexual adults of the country is relatively scarce; however, 20% of the new infections for HIV are registered approximately in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the youngsters, the infections for chlamydia are much more usual than in other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European enquiries, three quarters of all the infections affect youngsters of between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In our country, the virus of the papilloma human being is also added to the most usual illnesses among the youth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has the number of infections evolved?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all the sexually transmitted diseases are subject to obligatory declaration.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Institute Robert Koch, the number of infections for syphilis has doubled its cipher of 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new infections for HIV maintains a falling trend since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 approximately 2,700 cases were registered.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is a tenth part less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Which symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">The infectious illnesses can provoke ulcers in the genital area, bothers to the to urinate, flow, abdominal pain, like this as ampoules or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often they do not cause pain nor they provoke other symptoms and that's why they are not detected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can one be protected?</seg>
<seg id="57">The condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer protection a hundred percent.</seg>
<seg id="58">Some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections for dirt and for physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">For this reason, the experts recommend being submitted regularly to medical examinations, especially if it changes sexual couple frequently.</seg>
<seg id="60">If they are diagnosed early, most of the ETS can heal up and it is possible to avoid any late consequence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through collaborations, donations and, finally but not because of that less important, of the fees that the chorus charges by its performances in all Germany, they get to raise quite a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros To Esitjeni", indicates proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the people itself Zodwa Dlamini a woman sure of themselves and with leadership dowries it administers the money sent from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">He is in charge of the orphans finding a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The "gogos", as the old women are named in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have orphans up to 14 to its charge, offer them a ceiling to live and the days are in charge of the children going to the school all punctually and dressed with its uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those that do not have anybody remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, as the two cooks who are in charge of cooking all the days for more than 200 hungry children, earns a salary of the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Besides, "Voices of Africa" has started off a seam school, he has built two henhouses and, in collaboration with the American sanitary organization PSI, it has managed that many of the inhabitants of the people have submitted to a test of HIV.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not a little obvious, since, in spite of how obvious this illness is in all the country, people do not usually talk openly about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 handcuffs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"Aids is an absolute taboo", states Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with the sexuality".</seg>
<seg id="72">A little strange in a country in which the king has 14 handcuffs officially.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of the Black Africa, the king Mswati III, is known by its way of life opulent and full of excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This way of life not accepted officially is to a large extent responsible for the propagation that is so fast that the virus of the HIV has experienced in the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it also owes to the innumerable seasonal workers who go over the country of a side to another and who take it there where they go.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner free condoms can be obtained, but these are hardly used.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is another culture, here alone accept the skin contact against skin".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to encourage the cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years through the south of Africa singing songs that talk of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the most meridional end of the African continent still remember of the period of the apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of whites that sing songs in a language of blacks; so much recognition not alone brings with themselves an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to extract a couple of tears from some or other rabid frontier soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children been godfather to.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even though this small population hardly appears in the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Approach yourself to Esitjeni, there the light shines", states the people of the place.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after covering the 8,733 kilometers in direct line line of turn to Heidelberg up to the rooms of essay of the street Bergheimer full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light to shine from there.</seg>

<seg id="2">The probe Messenger has found tests of the ice existence in Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="3">Probably the glaze has a thickness of up to 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The NASA, the North American space agency, has brought forward tests of the ice existence in Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite it being about the nearest planet in the sun, is also there iced water, as specialized "Science" transpires from three studies published on Thursday in the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The probe Messenger would have found tests that in the area of the planet that is permanently at the shadow a glaze has been formed.</seg>
<seg id="7">It seems that this one has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters of thickness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water comes presumably of comets or, with great probability, of asteroids that then crashed against Mercurio.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nobody relates the finding of ice to the possibility of there being life in the planet, the investigator states head of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 centigrade degrees.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the findings could help clarify how the water and other components of the life to other areas of the solar system have arrived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Of completely unnoticed form for the inhabitants of the Earth planet, the probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix they dedicate themselves to exploring the depths of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="13">From time to time they send images to the Earth: small windows to the immensity of the space.</seg>
<seg id="14">The image comes from a camera developed by German investigators of the Institute Max Planck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The eight planets that form our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Pluto, which he turns around the sun at the back of Neptune exactly, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not any "planet".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This section of an image of infrared ones taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a "portrait of family" in which infinite star generations appear: the oldest stars appear as blue points, although the thing, most difficult to recognize, is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This region of formation of stars, named in a little romantic way for the scientists W5, was discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance from 6,500 light years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This iridescent image of a star in extinction was taken by the telescope Spitzer of the NASA.</seg>
<seg id="20">The ring in the form of doughnut is composed by the material that the star spits in its process of extinction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In the enormous Trifid Nebula, at 5,400 light years of the Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.</seg>
<seg id="22">The telescope Spitzer of the NASA took this photo of the area of galactic stellar formation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Gatherings, an also known group of stars with the nickname of "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object at first sight in the nocturnal sky.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, with the telescope the colors can be noticed better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Nebula of the Propeller appears as an enormous red eye appears in this image of infrared ones.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is situated at 700 light years of the constellation of Acuario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Its similarity with a terrestrial continent has cost the nickname of North America for him.</seg>
<seg id="28">The combination of a normal photograph and an image of infrared gives rise to a spectacular coloring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This potential star could be collected in all its splendor for the first time for the detectors of infrared of the telescope Spitzer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturn and its rings: how they originated keeps being one of the great unknown factors of the astronomy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Probably they are remains of one of the moons of Saturn that it disappeared without leaving trace 4,500 million years ago.</seg>

<seg id="32">One of the biggest and clearest photographs taken by the telescope Hubble: the Galaxy of the Whirlpool.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Depending on the tonality, some images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The image published through the Southern European Observatory shows the situated Trifid Nebula at several thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagitario.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name Trífida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided up into three), since some dark lines of dust divide up the red-hot heart of this area of stellar formation into three lobes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers could photograph the indications of a cosmic cannon: at 400 million light years of the Earth the cores of two galaxies in the process of merge are weighed the one towards the other one to end up crashing irremediably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">This formation of stars was collected by the telescope Hubble in the spiral galaxy M83.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those that do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Grinder Mill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The photograph of the space telescope Hubble shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefeo.</seg>
<seg id="40">The nebula situated at 1,400 light years is composed by particles of dust whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the particles of dust that we can find in a home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This image was created from optical images and of made X-rays by different telescopes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It shows a situated ring of black holes at 430 million light years of the Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a moment of model for the space telescope Hubble of the NASA.</seg>
<seg id="44">The scientists name 1810 the spiral galaxy of biggest size UGC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this nebula the group of brighter young stars of our Way is found Láctea.</seg>
<seg id="46">This area of stellar formation causes constantly new stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In this cloud of stars, associated to the Rosette Nebula, they also rise continuously new star; at 5,000 light years of the Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In this galaxy that is so shining with a small black hole yet there is not dust, single gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">The investigators suppose that it was formed little after the big bang, when in the universe he could find especially hydrogen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year afterwards to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes has not stopped of growing and the images that offer us have every time more depth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, precisely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale situated in the Dovecot Observatory near San Diego was the biggest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, EE. UU., the Large Binocular Telescope gets up.</seg>
<seg id="56">This one allows observing the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The interior of the Big Canary Islands Telescope situated in the island of La Palm is enormous - alone the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">In spite of that, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The inconvenience of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, therefore its mobility is limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its particularity is its enormous capacity for collecting light.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the biggest mirror telescopes of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With help of the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the investigators can explore the universe in search of signals of extraterrestrial life.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the "Search of Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for its initials in English) it can help any person who possesses a computer, providing capacity of prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) situated in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here gets up the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that does honor to its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the infrared spectrum half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The ESO it will also receive the named E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Telescope Extremadamente Grande).</seg>
<seg id="71">Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed by a total of 1,000 reflecting elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">Up to 2018 it is not expected to be able to take images.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Up to 2007 the two telescopes Keck situated in the Hawaian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">These have two mirrors, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The telescopes Keck are part of the Observatory Mauna Kea, which beside them explores the sky with the help of the telescope Subaru and the IRTTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of mirror of thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is an image of how it would be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important information of the cosmos arrives for us from the hand of the space telescope Hubble.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since the 24th of April 1990 it sends images of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">From March 2009 the space telescope Kepler looks for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On 2 of February 2011 the NASA announced that from the beginning of its mission 1,235 candidates to planets had been located.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the image the last preliminaries prior to the launch of the space telescope Kepler are seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched to the space on board a rocket Ariane 5 up to 2018.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The investigators set off from the base that in the south pole of Mercurio there is also ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there are not irrefutable tests, since the probe Messenger turns about the planet in an orbit much nearer to the north pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Since decades ago the measurements of radar point to the ice existence in Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first that orbits about Mercurio, the scientists now have the certainty that it is like this.</seg>

<seg id="5">In the south of Azerbaijan many people manage to reach biblical ages.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity.</seg>
<seg id="7">A searching of prints in a country in which the people of 97 years are still considered young.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The route through the mountainous region of Talysh could be qualified as wild and romantic one.</seg>
<seg id="9">The minibus advances with great racket across the sinuous road that it passes next to wooded hills, rivers of great flow and of the simple homes of the local farmers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, one could think even that it is in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However, we are in the most meridional area of Azerbaijan; from here the frontier with Iran finds some kilometers to so alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here they live the "talyshi", some people of which it is not known a lot, apart from their dominating perfectly the Persian and the Azerbaijani and their being very long-lived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Our final destination is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">This small city boasts about a designed perhaps too solid architecture in the era Soviet and which it does not seem completely to fit in a mountainous landscape that is so picturesque.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tourists European hardly arrive to this place, since the path from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to cover the 323 kilometers that separate both villages, they are needed eight hours because the road is of a single sense.</seg>
<seg id="17">The astonishing wealth that the country thanks to the oil of Caspian Sea still has has not arrived to this hidden region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what has to be had to convert in a touristic attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku was done famous in May for the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the most elderly people of the world", indicates Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is about the manageress of the Museum of the Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here is the life of eight dozens of talyshis of the place that they have surpassed the 100 years of age documented it. Fatulayeva indicates an image blank and black.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">A son of his died at the age of 136 years</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the indisputable star of the museum is the herdsman of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who it seems to have lived 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, there is not any birth certificate that certifies it.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if we take into account that the man of biggest documented age lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It was born in the region in 1805 and it died in 1973", explains Fatulayeva to us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently it still had time of conceiving one daughter more at 136 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="29">Has Şirali Müslümov made a mistake then in its age in a couple of decades?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist in the Institute Max Planck de Rostock, it has also heard to talk about the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan they also live people of very advanced age", states Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many old men".</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to bring forward scientific tests about the age; especially when there is not any register office either.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">All the days glasses full of melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent way, the inhabitants of the region situated about Lerik usually reach a biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">At present there are 20 people that they surpass the 100 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why do so many people of advanced age live here, in the south?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Azerbaijani touristic guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is about the special genes of the talyshis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The manageress of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, thinks however that the cause lies in the feeding.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the rich feeding in calories of the talyshi, which adore the meat, the bread and especially the dairy products and many of which, besides, they drink daily a glass of melted butter, is so healthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or perhaps is the one that maintains the young people the natural way of life? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">At its 97 years it is relatively young for what is fashionable for these latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, who states to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wooden home of all the region of Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sitting in the ground, it moves tirelessly an enormous butter large earthen jar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live under a ceiling, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both converted in grandparents some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="45">Small children also jump of a side to another second.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in some typical glasses with swollen form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and they are perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief it hides two long braids of dark blond hair that its son discovers for us proud.</seg>
<seg id="48">I have always washed myself the hair with milk, that's why never has fallen for me and it has maintained its color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I have never used a shampoo either", states Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The pension is sufficient to live</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Always he has eaten only what it produced in its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">In all my life I have never gone to do the purchase to a supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then it talks to us about its husband, who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">The worst thing was the subsequent period to the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, everything returned to its river bed when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took the control of the situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">This type of propaganda sounds strange in mouth of an old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in Azerbaijan the cult that is professed for the paternal figure of the nation, which manages its country as a dictator, does not know limits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">This one was maintained ruling up to 2003, moment in which the witness to its son Ilham yielded.</seg>
<seg id="59">At least the elderly of Azerbaijan do not know what is the poverty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same quantity in euros) in concept of monthly pension, a quantity with which it can be lived well taking the situation into account here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And perhaps the white-haired son of Mirzayeva is right: "in our culture the biggest are very respected".</seg>
<seg id="62">They live in a great family, are loved, receive all the necessary cares and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">As if this were not sufficient reason to keep with life many years...</seg>

<seg id="1">In the Constitution the "Human Rights" expression is lacking</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The revolution has gone back to Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrations that compete among themselves in Cairo show the tremendous division in which it is the country plunged.</seg>
<seg id="4">The future constitution, with the sharia as base, is very controversial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian president did not skimp in pathos.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We must surpass the transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">And that that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," stated in the public television.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its speech was directed to all the people, especially to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the erudite Muslims and the secular ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">All they, plunged without remedy until now in a confusing opposition, have fear.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fear of a theocracy alongside the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.</seg>
<seg id="11">As it explains Mohammed Mursi, almost asking for pardon, it has had to annul temporarily the competences of the Constitutional Court and extend his "to be able to overcome the revolution".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this engineer of 61 years with a doctorate title granted by the University of the South of California wants really to save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Does he intend to deprive of its power to the judgeship?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced for a constituent assembly composed by 100 members predominantly Islamists in a nocturnal meeting of 15 hours of duration, are really worrisome.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, in the draft it is also said that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of the Islamic law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, what means that of "principles"?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and it keeps being open to the interpretation and it seems that the Islamists are going to make use of this vague formulation, as well as the legal margin of maneuver that it takes fit out, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is at least what suggests a new added article: in all the questions related to the sharia it is obligatory to consult the University about Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution of the country with a great power in all the Sunni Islamism.</seg>
<seg id="19">It does not have why to be like this, but this can mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would have the disability of the judgeship as result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A great part of the draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What is also problematic is that he intends to maintain the military jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts were used for practicing a hard repression on the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fell it of the dictator civilians up to 11,000 were found stopped in military prisons.</seg>
<seg id="24">As he establishes the draft, the State has to protect "the real essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and its values".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is a formulation that is so imprecise in legal terms that with the help of this article the state institutions could even control the contents of the cinematography and the literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Speaking clearing it is not about another thing than about censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">By the way that no article establishes explicitly the equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">However another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and to its legacies.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, it does not remain clear what is an offense and how it has to be sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the same way of doubtful it is the formulation that it forbids the "offense to the people"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a counselor sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="32">Question of interpretation, as many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that as, its words, "very soon" it will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution has returned"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Does weeks that the opposition is closing ranks in the face of the superiority of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ten a thousand people met in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in the square Tahrir del Cario and they swore to make the Minutes fail before it can come into effect.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution has gone back and we will end up beating", states Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place in the lists to the presidential choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel de la Paz and exdirector of the International Organism of Atomic Energy, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft of the constitution should be "in the bucket of the garbage of the history".</seg>
<seg id="38">Across Twitter he accused the followers of Mursi of wanting to lead a "coup d'etat against the democracy".</seg>
<seg id="39">"When it calls the referendum we will go to its palace and will bring down it", states the opponent Jasser Said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"Yet we are not tired, the blood of our brothers yet" has not been "expiated", was mentioned in the Egyptian means to the opposing politician Chaled Ali.</seg>
<seg id="41">And several judges announced that they did not want to supervise the referendum, therefore it would not be considered valid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">On its part, the well organized Muslim community did a call to celebrate a counterdemonstration; just in case not in the square Tahrir, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many women covered with a veil and partisans of the Salafi ones took part in the same one to the shout of: "the people demand the divine law enforcement".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They required from Mursi to "clean the country", at the same time as they proclaimed: "the Koran is our constitution".</seg>
<seg id="46">A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic square Tahrir, where it started everything, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is evident that the partisans of Mursi did not want to risk a little like this its happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim brothers stated that those that oppose the draft of the constitution as well as the partisans of it would have expressed its opinions high and clear.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now it would have arrived the moment of leaving that the people decided in the urns which address should follow the country.</seg>
<seg id="50">In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has the majority guaranteed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"The Human Rights expression not even appears"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that in fact should have lasted until February and included at all the social forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">This lawyer of 48 years specialized in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were retained in prison or they had to face a judgment during the dictatorship of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="54">Not because it shared its ideology, but because for him the Human Rights are indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">For this reason it was knocked, condemned and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="56">"And now the `Human Rights' expression `not even appears in the new constitution", complains in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".</seg>
<seg id="57">The enlargement of the competences of Mursi to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resign himself.</seg>
<seg id="58">The adopted measures are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will take Egypt to a new dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening the civil society, what has done the president is to abolish it", Saeda complains.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, the democracy cannot work without the organizations of the civil society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda feels given up, also by the international community, which observes the ideological fight that is taking place alongside the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.</seg>
<seg id="62">This could be returned in his against.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: the most foul-smelling fish of the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway have one of the biggest standards of living, not only of Europe but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Is it possible that the success of the country keeps some relation with its avidity for an extremely foul-smelling fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place them in the middle of a dirty and humid mountain of clothes of soccer.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave it there a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">He will be able to smell then the paralyzing aroma of the rakfisk, one of the exquisiteness of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small city of Fagernes, at about three hours of Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is snowed. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always presents, fleet in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The rakfisk is a trout in salting that is let ferment in water during, depending on how foul-smelling you prefers it, year up to one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As it darkens and keeps being more cold, the Norwegians go in droves to a festival that is celebrated dedicated to this special dish here, in Fagernes, of the more, so to speak, captivating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"It is eaten raw and a glass of aquavit of a gulp is drunk afterwards", says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is in charge of organizing the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">For all sides we see people this fish that is put away in small buckets and drinking important quantities of the drink of a gulp eating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk", states Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink can kill the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I try some bits.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not unwell; it is not very different at a portion of sushi that has gone over some kilometers in bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The rakfisk is a product that originates from a very different period, in which the poverty whipped Norway and in which, before the refrigeration existed, the fish was put away during the fall submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Later, whole winter, when it is already well fermented, is taken and, evidently with the inactive senses due to the alcohol, it is eaten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">He does only one generation, thousands of Norwegians were seen obliged to leaving its country in search of work, and they mainly emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">At present, the population is increasing quickly; more of 13% they are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a complete system of social services.</seg>
<seg id="22">A current of inhabitants of Sweden, the rival old woman and even it does not too much much richer that Norway, arrives to this country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is considered a little important, an essential part, although quite foul-smelling, of the past of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is among the most expensive dishes that they can buy to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="25">But, in fact, everything is expensive. A cane of beer or a sandwich cost you the shivery one of 10 € ($14) each.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not usually appear in the agenda of the international news and the majority of Norwegians likes it like this to be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here the people are still little ready-disposed to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist of extreme right that she riddled to shots and that murdered 77 people, among which there were men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In its place, they refer to the firing as "the event of the 22nd of July".</seg>
<seg id="29">It is difficult for the Norwegians very much to believe that in its calm country one of his it was capable of committing such a cruelty and homicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After a lot of the current wealth of Norway it finds the growth, from greater principles of the seventies, of one of the oil industries and of gas of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But the oil is not the only reason why it goes so well for us", states Anna, our waitress, while it keeps passing trays of rakfisk and that, with its long blond long hair and its surprising blue eyes, the image of the Norwegian welfare represents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We are, as you say, prudent people."</seg>
<seg id="33">Its English, as that of the people majority in this country, is impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It does not please us to brag, we does not like the ostentation".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money proceeding from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of the future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">While all the world wasted money that it did not have during the years that they preceded the financial crisis in all the world, Norway held the well closed wallet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can ski in winter and do hiking in summer, we are happy", says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And to eat rakfisk", adds with an offhand laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am in the snow making queue to eat something; I have already had sufficient rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now an elk hamburger is undoubtedly something different and quite tasty to savor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But at night, he turns that foul-smelling fish over.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel in the one that I lodge myself is one of the many sites in which a dinner of rakfisk in which the fellow diners vote the best fish is celebrated, or maybe the one that puts the nasal fossae to the test more.</seg>
<seg id="43">A television has connected live with a presenter who takes bow tie and who is surrounded of dishes of rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The competition of Eurovision seems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Which are your punctuations for the best fish there above in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here our punctuation is, Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There are laughters and applauses.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls off the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or perhaps they are the steams of all that fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard beginning</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take possession of its charge, the correspondent of the BBC, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges that the new president will face and the different expectations of its population.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The traffic in Mexico City is specially bad at present.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already of by itself congested, a steel siege that cuts several of the main roads that take to the city and that an enormous chaos is causing in the roads has been installed from Monday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The goal, however, was not to prevent its working place the workers being able to arrive, but to avoid the demonstrators being able to arrive to the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and will assume the management of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It faces a complicated task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico has kept obtaining good economic results during the overhanging government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against the narcotráfco that has already taken away about 60,000 lives in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has the great commitment with the Mexican people of reducing the violence", explained Mr. Peña Nieto at the beginning of this week To the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"I am going to suggest a new safety strategy that will allow us to reach that goal".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the US., the previous political experience of Mr. Group was as governor of its natal state, that of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">A state very populated and with a fast growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions on the new leader are divided up into this territory in which he used to move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A sincere man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the bucolic city of Valle of the Brave, for example, it is reminded with affection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of the tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructures to him.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to arrive to the city it can be led by one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which means an enormous improvement compared with the roads cracked and full of potholes patches that were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plaques can also be seen with its name in the entry of a modern sports center and of an impressive interactive museum on the climatic change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We trust that he manages to carry out a real and long-lasting change", Gabriel Olvera Hernández, representative of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI, says its friend and political ally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"Particularly, as for safety and economics, we wait for the interesting and true change that our country needs so much".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After an uninterrupted period of 81 ruling years, the PRI was overtaken by Vicente Fox in the year 2000.</seg>
<seg id="21">The representative Olvera admits that, after 12 years it went of the presidential palace of Los Pinos, in the party there are many expectations with regard to Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">It refuses also the qualification that the opposition makes of lack of essence of the new president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"He is a man very sincere, very engaged and with an excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a fantastic statesman and, above all, is a person that knows how to listen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">However, at the other side of the state that is not the impression that has many people on its former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, known also as City Neza, the contrast with the streets paved of Valle of the Brave could not be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under high motorway stretches a suburb of the own one is, in many senses, Mexico City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year the intervention of the soldiers was asked so that they helped in the fight against the bands of drug that they operate on in the neighborhoods and the violence against the women is specially severe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a desert lot, situated beside a garbage waste tip, they have been left the bodies of dozens of murdered women given up only in the two last years.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of City Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with homicide of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, in the best of the cases, that it did not know how to tackle the problem of the feminicidio while it was in the charge.</seg>
<seg id="33">The most critical accuse its administration of turning a blind eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete home, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to do efforts to contain the tears while it shows me photographs of its daughter, Mariana Luna, died.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, its family thinks that its couple murdered her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived to its home, it seemed as if they had cleaned it the body", remembers Mrs. Buendía.</seg>
<seg id="38">"There were signs that it had been knocked and the mortis rigor already had appeared".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While its mother relates the history, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, beside a cross in which only one word is read: Justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, that is exactly what the family says that it has been denied to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"The authorities of the state have treated me as if were, a stirrer, a grumbler, a gossiping old woman.</seg>
<seg id="42">What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that it keeps silent".</seg>
<seg id="43">"But that cannot be like this when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence", states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The presidential band that the Group President Nieto will receive on Saturday will come accompanied by an enormous responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of thousands of families have been seen affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the last six years and the new president has promised to prioritize them during its mandate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I wait that or the same type of president that was a governor when it was", says the representative of the PRI Olvera in Valley of the Brave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of City Neza fear more.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Bradley Manning did not denounce abuses, as they state the prosecutors</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The prosecutors try to face the complaints of abuses of Bradley Manning during its stay in prison</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The judgment is focused in the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defense wants for the case to be rejected basing itself on the imprisonment of Manning being severe</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The prosecutors tried to prove the Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities of denouncing the abuses that now claims that it suffered while it was found under military arrest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">During the interrogation that the attorney's office carried out to Manning in a view prior to the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the registers of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received for nine months of arrest in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaint on the deal that received.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interrogation, which was carried out during a view carried out as a result of the request of the defense that the case was rejected since its imprisonment had been hard and that that had already meant sufficient punishment, arrived that a day people afterwards of Manning having testified that it had thought about committing suicide while it was thorough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The analyst of intelligence of the army, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while it was of service in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, WikiLeaks published the material in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the information source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the view of Friday, Fein revised with Manning the forms that the officers filled in after the visits to Manning during its arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where seclusion was imprisoned in maxim regime since July 2010 to April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The officers would have carried out questions to Manning and written down its answers.</seg>
<seg id="14">When on Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that it had qualified the treatment that the guards gave him as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms do not show any complaint of abuses, even though the officers asked to Manning directly on the treatment that received, stated Fein.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning answered that he had expressed its worry on some questions and that the officers who visited him had talked about those problems and they had indicated to him that they would be treated, but that they did not leave evidence of those questions in the register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"They wrote 'without incidences' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not mean necessarily that I had not mentioned any problem", said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why the treatment that it received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a board of advice responsible for examining the suicide intentions had not reported that she had expressed months in a form before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning answered that its intention during that meeting was that of obtaining the reduction of the regime of "prevention of injuries" under which it was found.</seg>
<seg id="20">The soldiers said that they had put him under that restrictive regime, which finds a degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to guarantee its protection and the safety of other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It wanted for the staff to know that I was well and (it wanted) to stop being under prevention of injuries... in order to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life", he said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday on its arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where it was retained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison situated in the base of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said that he had considered to commit suicide in Kuwait and that on an occasion it lost the knowledge due to the heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said that the fact that it was not allowed to know what he was passing him or what he passed in the exterior world was very distressing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world was reduced only to the Camp Arafjon, to that cage", explained Manning on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I thought that it was going to die in that cage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, passed most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning said that only it was allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some mules, some clothes and its glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">It explained that it tried to move all the time, since it was prohibited to sleep or even to lie down during the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Manning stated that it always had an appropriate light outside pointing to its eyes while he slept.</seg>
<seg id="31">He said that if the guards could not see the face for him when people turned around at night, they woke him up so that people turned around again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The lawyer of Manning presented in January 2011 a formal claim on the treatment that received Manning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On Friday the judge asked To Manning on a plea that had carried out in the declaration of Thursday, according to which, after being obliged a night to sleeping naked in its cell of Quantico, desdnudo was obliged it during a morning counting to remaining standing in front of the guards and of other prisoners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning had testified that the opportunity of being covered with the blanket during the counting had never been given him.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said that it deduced for the order that gave it the guard that had to leave to fall the blanket with the one that could have been covered, but recognized that nobody had ordered him that it let it fall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Manning testified the Thursday that had obliged it to sleeping naked the previous night because of an attempt to prove a danger to an officer that he did not mean for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning stated that it had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of its underwear or its flip-flops to selfinjure itself but that he had not made it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Manning testified that that night they had withdrawn its underwear, its flip-flops and its glasses from its cell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Its lawyers have the hope that the judge takes at least the experiences for which it happened during its stay in prison into account and reduces drastically its sentence if it was condemned in the court-martial, which is foreseen that it starts at the beginning of the year that she comes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense stated that it plans on making Manning be declared guilty of misdemeanors and defending other accusations considered too extreme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">It is foreseen that the view is renewed this weekend and it is expected the prosecutors to argue that the conditions of the arrest were justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pentagon has held that Manning was retained according to the norms of application to every person under arrest that it meets under maximum custody in Quantico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, to provoke illegally the information publication in Internet, filtration of information of the national defense and theft of property or public registers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If it is declared guilty of all the charges, it could face life imprisonment.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of Mexican-American identity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It states that many were seen obliged to leaving Mexico due to the lack of opportunities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexicans tend to criticize those that left; he says that they remember the Mexicans of those difficult times</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In a recent journey to Mexico City, it had hardly lowered through the levelled area and arrived to the area of procedure of immigration and it was already totally confusing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Some posters indicated the path towards two queues: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Extranjeros".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stayed there some seconds without being sure where it had to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">When having grown in Central California, during all my life they have called me "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is ethnic shorthand, in the same way in which my friends of Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends of New York qualify to themselves "Italian".</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided for "Mexican-American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="13">Simply it was American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish. Well enough as to manage during an interview in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and cannot get rid of my American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and set in the queue of foreigners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought in that moment of this week in which the president elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet the President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the agenda of the day, as whenever the leaders of these two countries meet, it figured: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Grandson Group was wanting to talk also about the growth of the Mexican economics, one of the reasons for which in these moments it is so probable that a Mexican stays in Mexico as that it dares to go to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to team up with the United States and Canada and to create a commercial block for the style of the European Union in North America.</seg>
<seg id="21">Besides, Group Nieto promised to keep fighting against the cartels of the drug in Mexico, although it did not give details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, the relation with the United States is complicated and is full of grudge.</seg>
<seg id="23">Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and obliged its leaders to handing half of its territory over to tip of pistol.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for the Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So, in the moment in which a civil servant of the United States says anything that entails the most minimum criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, so much in the press as between the elite Mexican, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children of Moctezuma are stood up of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And like this, for Mexico, the relation that really means a whole challenge is still the one that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">We talk of grudge?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not like this.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican ancestry living Denver or San Antonio in cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, is that, in some point of our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or the mother or some of the grandparents, to which the door of the opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to work towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And most of the times that person fit in a specific profile: dark skin, a level of studies under, proceeding from some poor people, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are his downward and we are to them loyal.</seg>
<seg id="34">To Mexico not.</seg>
<seg id="35">And, even though perhaps we are living now the American dream, when having gone to good schools and has had good works, can ever not lose of view that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty yes that is.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is for the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Besides, we are conscious that to many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class we do not please.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look at us above the shoulder as if we were of an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">To its mode of seeing, our existence is synonymous with failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.</seg>
<seg id="44">And now we would not find caught after this silky curtain, living well in the United States but, still like this, as solitary souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My woman, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when it was a girl, remembers me that this rub between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans exists because the first know with more solidity who are and at the seconds this bothers them.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans that I know feel that they do not belong to any of the two.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Mexican group Los Tigres of the North, but also to Bruce Springsteen us love their listening.</seg>
<seg id="49">You have the best thing of every country, but are not deep-rooted to none of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico they see us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we are considered Mexican.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, in order to still complicate more the things, for what I have found out myself during my journey, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect again with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want for the Mexican-Americans to work as "ambassadors" of Mexico improvised, representing its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We would tell our American companions how fantastic it is to visit that country and would press the political leaders so that they reinforced its ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, clear...</seg>
<seg id="56">That is not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is too much grudge.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, with the inequality of salaries, the galloping corruption and the violence for drugs, many of us are not so sure of her being a fantastic country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear that you are going to remain, friends, alone with this idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It is exactly.</seg>
<seg id="61">If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way in which they treated Mexico a century ago and a half, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still suffered for how its relatives were treated very much less time ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than he thought.</seg>

<seg id="15">In fact, Hamás is gaining ground in West Bank, the other part of Palestine at present governed by its implacable competitors of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Besides, the leaders of Hamás could arrive to the conclusion that the time plays its favor.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the Islamists have kept gaining influence for all the Arab world, Hamás has done rich and powerful friendships.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a renascent regional power that previously had been the Muslim ally nearest to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamás. Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Gulf, has also made it.</seg>
<seg id="19">The exultant members of Hamás say that the Islamist half-moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where dominates Hizbulá the party-militia, passing through Syria, where the rebels of a trend more and more Islamist could bring down Bashar Assad, until it arrived to Jordan, where the allies of Hamás are threatening the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Especially in the meridional flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers directed by the President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with difference the most populated and basic one of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot that it governed in Egypt for 30 years up to its fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamás.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Muslim Brothers are brother cousins of Hamás and its leaders depend more on the popular opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamás rises up as protagonist to the one that cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the contrary conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">In what is referred the military question, they have put Hamás in its place.</seg>
<seg id="26">The anti-missile system Cúpula of Iron of Israel has proved its efficiency and many of the missiles of Hamás have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis will sleep calmer... during some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for the diplomacy, the United States appear firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamás for having initiated the last violence wave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamín Netanyahu, a first minister who has been unaware of the peace process widely.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets shot from Gaza Strip have finished with the life of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partially thanks to the barrier that corrodes West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to being converted in a state of Palestine, and it protects the Jewish settlements that they keep increasing even though, according to the international legislation, they are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of a harder line still led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period prior to the choices on the 22nd of January, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why to pamper those twisted Palestinians giving them an own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If really they governed in West Bank, they would not shoot rockets as they have done his compatriots in Gaza Strip?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to have them after that wall and to give them a good knock if they lift the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hard wing imposes itself, although the Arab spring it could alter its calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists who take the power in Egypt and in other places do not have too much appreciation to Israel, its priority will be to tackle the internal difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense budget of Israel is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbors together is.</seg>
<seg id="38">Hardly initiating a war against the superpower of the area will help the new Arab governments improve its economics.</seg>
<seg id="39">That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to obtain the ceasefire is a good augury and it could mark the beginning of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also the Israelis should think in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the rest of the Arab world being turned more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of its right to the self-determination means to create a gunpowder that a day will exploit in the territories occupied by Israel, of the same form that this week exploited a bus in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repression already is undermining the democracy in the Jewish state and the demography worsens the situation as he increases the Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody missions against Gaza Strip every two or three years to refuse to Hamás will pay a bigger diplomatic toll every time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a jostle of people foreign to the conflict.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The solution keeps being the one that sensible people of both sides, the majority of the exterior world and this newspaper call out: two states and the cession of territory on the part of Israel for reasons of safety.</seg>
<seg id="46">The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more of impulse to the foreign people that are fighting for this cause.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which must start to put brake to the entry of weapons in Gaza Strip, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in a situation without precedents to convince to Hamás that it accepts the idea about a state Jewish based on the frontiers of 1967, with exchanges of earth and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs foreign to the matter should also press Hamás and Fatah so that they join.</seg>
<seg id="49">That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Obama also has an important paper as for managing to take Israel to the negotiation table.</seg>
<seg id="51">During its first mandate it omitted presenting its own plan for the peace.</seg>
<seg id="52">Again in the White House, it seems just as reticent to dedicate its attention to him.</seg>
<seg id="53">This attitude means a deplorable vision of future.</seg>
<seg id="54">A stable Middle East is of vital interest for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="55">This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The law of generic packed one of tobacco comes into effect in Australia</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings on the risks to smoke and parts of the body with illnesses shine on packs of a dull green color, which are them for all the brands of tobacco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Australian law on the subject of tobacco and packed generic, pioneer in the world, comes into effect and replacing the logos and the colors of the brands by a wrapping of an olive-green switch-off, some dreadful images of parts of the body with illnesses and representations of children and ill babies for being children of smokers fathers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Except for the different images and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packs, obligatory from Saturday, they are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a type of source small.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about the strictest regime of the world applied to the one packed of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to dissuade the youngsters from smoking through the elimination of the features that make this habit have glamour.</seg>
<seg id="7">He trusts studies that prove that if a person has not started to smoke before the 26 years, there is 99% of possibilities of her never making it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"It "can be seen that the children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand", stated the minister of federal Health, Tanya Plibersek, mentioning studies that showed, for example, how the girls related the logo of a crown to the idea about being a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Even though Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers of the world and even though these changes will not affect the profits for the multinationals too much, other countries are considering to take action similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry has exerted an enormous pressure against the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies stated that the law would encourage the black market of tobacco, in which the cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The legislation will entail severe involuntary consequences", said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco, in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">He will increase the quantity of tobacco that the forgers of China and Indonesia will bring to sell it in the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other people say that its business has benefited after the approval of the law.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small enterprise familiar, stated that the demand for cigarette cases and covers of silicone to cover the unpleasant images of the packs up had soared almost from zero two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost an objection to the law in the High Court Court of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mrs. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was waiting for more existences.</seg>
<seg id="17">"For us it is a good deal".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of the social nets between the demographical sector to which the plan is addressed.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of Australian laws that forbid the publicity in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that oblige the majority of salespersons not to put the cigarettes in sight, the marketing of the tobacco has happened to be carried out online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has forbidden the publicity in the Internet to companies and local web pages, but she cannot restrict it on foreign pages.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you market tobacco and this small window only remains you to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place in which to be", said Becky Freeman, investigator of public health of the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman observed an increase of reviews on brands proceeding from "ordinary citizens" published on web pages of social nets as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">One may wonder if it is only a private citizen who really loves the cigars Marlboro and he has taken la molestia of carrying out a video or if any marketing company is behind all that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what implies the new norm than in the marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has managed even to pay so that Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic reject the new norms; these countries are stating before World Trade Organization that the trade is restricting unfairly, even though none of these countries have a volume of significant trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is probable that OMC dictates a resolution in the middle of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek stated that the government had maintained conversations with other countries that are considering to apply similar laws on the subject of one packed of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the year 2001 Canada became the first country that introduced the obligatory nature of including images in the packs.</seg>
<seg id="29"> At present they are obligatory in more than 40 countries, among which they find Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India it is being considered to apply harder laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In Australia many smokers appear challenging.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The photographs do not affect me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Simply I do not pay them attention".</seg>
<seg id="34">"You catch the cigar and you put the packet away", says Victor El Hage while it buys a packet with the image of a tumor in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Sincerely, there is only a reason for the one that it would stop smoking: for my daughter."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, manager of the tobacconist's shop King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform packs make that it finds it more complicated to place them in the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Normally a delivery took an hour in desenvalar; now slow four", states Yu.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government should have forbidden the tobacco totally and it is then, already, it costs, it was finished and we close the store", says while it lifts the hands upward.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a constantly connected world, it is not so badly to be gotten sick of a little</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During the parties of the day of Acción of Gracias of this year, I had to spend five hours in an airport unexpectedly because the airplane in which we flew suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another airplane to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="3">So I had very much time to think in the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am not going to lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">To spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be amusing, as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But every time there are more academicians and experts in child development that the kindnesses of the boredom praise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">According to them, it is well that, we as well as our children, get bored from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Being gotten bored obliges to the brain to look for interesting options and maybe it encourages the creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since, at present, most of us are connected to this one or to that screen, we do not experiment on the profits that the boredom provides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">As soon as, should we accept the boredom of good spirit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And not.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, we will already talk about that further on on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the first place, as many people, it meant that, now that we have more time for the leisure, the boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, as it states Peter Toohey, head of department of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: To Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated history") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not like this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, the history of the boredom is very extensive", states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the walls of Pompeya there are graffitis in Latin on the boredom that date of the 1st century A.D.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We must also consider how we define the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The problem is that it has already been defined and had discussed in very different ways", indicates John D. Eastwood, teacher of Psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After examining the published researches and suggesting the idea in the face of a discussion group formed by 100 people, the Teacher Eastwood and its colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not power, to take part in an activity that fills you".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It states that the difference between the boredom and the apathy is that the person does not make something but wants to make it.</seg>
<seg id="22">It indicates that with the apathy the desire to make something does not exist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main experience of the boredom, states, is "the alteration of the process of attention, associated to a low state of mind and to a sensation that the time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The boredom can sound terribly similar to the depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the Teacher Eastwood says that, even if they can be related, the people that are boring tend to see the problem as a question of the environment or of the world, whereas the people that are deprived consider that the problem have it they.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that we are boring, when what succeeds us in fact is that we have problems to concentrate.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom un Terms of Attention", published in the edition of September of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, the Teacher Eastwood and its colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which the participants listened to a ribbon of a person who read the article of a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups listened in the contiguous room to a television program full blast that it did not keep any relation, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was hardly perceptible, whereas the third group did not listen to the audio one in any moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The group that the program with the low volume listened to showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was them difficult to be concentrated, but were not sure of why and attributed it to the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"When you try to concentrate you in a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of the attention can take to the boredom", indicated Mark J. Fenske, teacher of Neuroscience of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, when you are doing something gotten bored, as detecting faulty pieces in a production line, a music that distracts you can help you not to get bored".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"In fact, we at present know that to move or to do doodles, actions that are often interpreted as sign of boredom, they can help in fact fight it, since they make that person be physically more alert."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The researches prove that those children who are allowed to move to learn more and they retain more information than those to those that are obliged to them to be still", states the Teacher Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all know what is to get bored in some moment: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a specially boring film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people have more trend to get bored than others do.</seg>
<seg id="36">In order to help measure it, some investigators developed in the eighties a "scale of trend of the boredom".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes questions as "many of the things that I have to make are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I do not have time of making everything".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Stephen Vodanovich, teacher of Psychology of the University of West Florida, states that, using these scales, the investigators have discovered that the boys have more trend to get bored more often than the girls, and they precisely need more external and more varied stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But, in general, the adolescents are a type of group of which people get sick with quite a lot of easiness.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, human and community teacher of Development of the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which 400 adolescents and its fathers between seven and eight times were contacted it per day through one searches.</seg>
<seg id="41">He discovered that 32 per cent of the adolescents said that he got bored while it was at school or doing the duties, whereas 23 per cent said that he got bored when it was not at school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 per cent of the fathers said that they got bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Teacher Larson said that he did not know if the current percentages of boredom, 21 years afterwards, would be superior or inferior.</seg>
<seg id="44">But said that what yes knew was that "the adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches his levels more discharges", to a large extent because a great control is not given to the children as well as the adolescents on what want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, returning to my question of the principle: is it good to get bored?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes it is not it, since, taken to the end, can make us run the risk of absurd physical risks, as doing handsome or falling in the consumption of substances as method to fight it, as they prove the researches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection among the boredom and the creativity, as the Teacher Vodanovich states, that he has been studying this question for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"The boredom is the way that has the brain of saying you that you should be doing another thing", says Gary Marcus, teacher of Psychology of the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain not always knows what is the most appropriate thing.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you are boring and use that energy to touch the guitar or to cook, that will satisfy you.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you watch the television, it is possible that it satisfies you in the short term, but not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">"So, if your son is boring and you give it a iPad, it is possible that it is not gotten any longer bored, but will not have learned to be entertained by itself or to be dosed", states the Teacher Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "that capacity to be dosed is applied to other situations", indicates.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your son not only learns to be entertained by itself alone, but learns to be controlled better in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that really we want to praise the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we should not be too critical either with it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our goal should be, rather, that of feeling comfortable sections of the constant rumor of the activities and the technologies for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The teacher Eastwood agrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"To our mode of seeing, we need to get us bored more, but the boredom is a too distressing and disturbing desire as in order to relate it with something that deserves the sorrow", it states.</seg>
<seg id="60">It indicates that what the people really look for is a way of disconnecting and of enjoying an idle time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated", it states, "it is difficult to find ways of focusing our attention when the noise ceases".</seg>

<seg id="1">Colorado: without book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marihuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, student of 19 years in a community institute and soccer player of the southeast of Colorado, faces a penal process for of something that soon will be legal in all the state: the possession of some marihuana stones and a pipe that it used to smoke it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Orozco says that a day in September, he and some friends led the police for Lamar, in the plains near to the frontier of Kansas, when it stopped them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The police found marihuana in the car and a time afterwards Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related articles (misdemeanors that entail each a fine of 100 United States dollars) in the one that he was informed about the date of the judgment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They deal us as to criminals", says Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">And are they?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the following weeks of uncertainty to the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small quantities of marihuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of smaller causes for possession of drugs depends less on the law than on the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of misdemeanors for possession of marihuana are being annulled as much here as in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was approved.</seg>
<seg id="9">The departments of police have slovenly of to introduce charges against the ones older than 21 years for possession at a small scale, which will be approved legally once the law has come into effect in the next weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the prosecutors of districts more preserving of Colorado have committed themselves to continuing ahead with the cases opened by possession of marihuana and are still quoting people.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver up to the occidental mountains, are voting to prevent marihuana stores, authorized recently, from opening in its communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the following", said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Dawn, exactly in the east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington also are giving turns to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">And they keep looking for advice to establish a system of licenses of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; everything that before the deadline arrives, on 1 of December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that, for well or for badly, Colorado goes in front of most of the states as for the regulation of the use of the marihuana, first with terapeúticos ends and now for recreational use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", states Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Commission of control of the alcohol of the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only do suggestions on what could work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is not a real precedent that serves us of model", states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The law of Washington, named I-502, comes into effect on the 6th of December, which leaves also a year during which people will swim between two waters, since the system of licenses in that state yet will not exist, but the possession will be legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Besides, exist some questions mechanical delicate that they must be solved during that period, as the mode of maintaining a balance between the demand of the state of offering an "adequate access" to the authorized marihuana and its prohibition of carrying out businesses of cannabis in a radius inferior to 300 meters of schools, parks, child areas of game or centers infantile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"In no place it will be more difficult to place a business of authorized cannabis that in the urban zones, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Center for the legal cannabis, a group of research created recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The 21 of November, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, e-mailed its policemen in which it informed them about the prosecutor of the city stopping interposing judicial actions for slight mistakes for possession of marihuana at elderly of 21 years and of which the police would stop introducing charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The chief of police Oates said that they would be in charge of making the crop of marihuana comply with the norm of the city that it regulates with therapeutic purposes and that they would keep pursuing dealers and pushers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the county of Weld, in the north of Colorado, the prosecutor of the district, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, it assured that its office would keep pursuing the cases of possession of marihuana, mainly to press the consumers and that they decide to receive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At present, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marihuana, although many of them have other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office has the duty to interpose judicial actions against those mistakes that in the moment in which they took place were a crime", said Mr. Buck in a declaration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The answer has been complicated even in places as the rural county of Mesa, where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of the marihuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police of Grand Junction, the biggest city of the county, do not quote adults any longer for possession of small quantities.</seg>
<seg id="30">Pete Hautzinger, prosecutor of the district of the county, supported this decision, but he also decided not to reject any of the pending cases for possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not consider that it is wasting time when keeping doing to comply the law until this one changes", stated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Even though 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that taking the consumption of marihuana for recreational use to the bosom of the government and of the judicial system was it to be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">The contradictory reactions that rise up for all the state show a marked ambivalence among the civil servants as for the great environmental experiment in this state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It "is a cultural barrier with the prosecutors of the district", states Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver that represents the accused for possession of marihuana and that local spokesman of the Organization is National for the Reform of the law on the marihuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have passed so much time taking to people before the courts that, in fact, cannot accept yet that is legal", stated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As it is the first states that the small quantities of marihuana in the same way consider that if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington they are prepared to convert in the test cases at national level as for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While lawyers and civil servants of the state have a new frontier of legal sales, they also expect to receive indications of the federal government, which still foresees the consideration of the sale and the crop of marihuana as federal crimes, anxious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The defenders of the legalization of the marihuana have the hope that the Department of justice yields.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even though some distinguished arrests of patients and salespersons of marihuana for therapeutic purposes have taken place, the federal government has allowed in the main businesses of sale of marihuana with these ends there to be in Colorado, Washington and 16 states more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"Although it is probable that the antidrug agents do not throw doors down to confiscate a bag exchange of small drug, they will probably be shown reluctant to allow the functioning of stores regulated by the state for the marihuana sale for recreational use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an exadvisor of antidrug policy of the administration of Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities of Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the day of the choices, some local governments passed moratory on any new store of marihuana, even though it will happen that it about one year before of any of them being able to open.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the occidental city of Montrose took on a prohibition in six months and it is probable that it approves it next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to put on in a situation in which we authorize to somebody and afterwards we have a severe problem at federal level", explained Bob Nicholson, member of the town council.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our community voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are studying in favor of what voted the community in front of voting in favor of what voted the state."</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: "They hounded me until I leaned from Oxford because one was Tory"</seg>
<seg id="2">The university students for its points of view are not attacked alone now</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">I do not remember any moment in my life in which it has not been dreaming in obtaining a square in the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father as well as my oldest brother had been in the one that I meant was the best place of the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of the civilization: the free thought and the tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, at the two weeks of occupying my square in the Worcester College at the end of the eighties to study the race of History, already he had made the suitcases, which triggered off the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father was brought down and it began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because it did not tolerate some university companions maintaining sexual intercourse in the room nearby.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had left because they obliged me to drinking in chipped cups joking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away from there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran away, because it had been submitted to a systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not due to my extravagant name, nor to the fact that it came of a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">They hounded me for only one reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was something intolerant and barbarous: my father, the deceased man Woodrow Wyatt, was a distinguished advisor of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Perhaps they wonder to what that comes now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, several reports indicate that a new right generation of students of center is suffering a similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The institutionalized and increasing hatred for the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights that the homosexuals have, the disabled ones and the ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Preserving members of the JCR (group of students of degree) of Corpus Christi College state that they are "often seriously put aside, personally attacked and treated as not nice people" for its political ideas.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to create a post in the committee of equality of opportunities of its university school to make sure of being able to express its opinions freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Its situation was not seen favored by a recent documentary of the BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The paradise: young, shining and right-wing) on the policy of the ones student and that presented to the Tories as eccentrics and neonazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It showed the student of postgraduate course Joe Cooke, expresident of the Association of the conservative party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, exhibiting a silvery suit and a stick with the silver handle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities, the preserving students say that it is treated for them as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher rates of registration.</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Black, of 20 years and vice-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that "there is an increasing left-wing trend at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people assume that we are as the Bullingdon Club without not even to know us".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, of 21 years and student of history in Corpus Christi that presented the motion for a bigger protection, states that this atmosphere is "uncomfortable", whereas Stephanie Cherill, of 19 years and president elect of the OUCA, states that the attitude of the members of the right JCR towards the people who are of center has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This means a threat for the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members", states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than the one was.</seg>
<seg id="28">I entered at university in September 1986, was a youngster of 18 years terribly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred for the Conservative Party was in its highest point.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former pupil, a "honoris causa" title after the cutbacks in the financing of the Superior Education.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shake of fright.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students are known and the heads of department are known, received a sample of the bitterness that it waited for me for.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that the heads of department not only turned a blind eye in the face of the mockery that was acted as the preserving university students, but took part in it willingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The policy of the strike of the miners, the privatization and the opposition of the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa arrived up to the wooden rooms of the seminar.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first that I assisted had to be translated to the Englishman French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt", said the head of department Harry Pitt (already deceased) "please, translate the first paragraph".</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not give even one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt, a short man with a face that seemed cake mass, knew how how to expel bad bile well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"It is that Thatcherites refuse to learning French or is that, simply, are foolish?", asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other university students laughed.</seg>
<seg id="41">The eyes of the tears which he tried to contain burned for me.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest it that it goes to classes of French in its spare time, provided it is not too much occupied knowing people," growled Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I went back to my room as a soul in purgatory.</seg>
<seg id="44">That night I sat alone at the time of the dinner at university; then I felt a slight slap in the back.</seg>
<seg id="45">Year called James that seemed as member of the OUCA was a student of English of second.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are", said me nicely.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I fear that this is how the thing goes.</seg>
<seg id="48">They enter with any who is a suspect of being Tory.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is very complicated, but they know that your father is near to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will still be worse.</seg>
<seg id="50">Many newcomers Tories to pretend to be related to the Labor Party".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Further on on, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to dissimulate.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted in that it did not agree with all what Mrs. Thatcher said.</seg>
<seg id="53">That trick was useless.</seg>
<seg id="54">A student of first year of Philosophy, Policies and Economics that, paradoxically, it had studied in Eton, said: "You are a daughter of a fascist pig.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contaminated".</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students adopted that song.</seg>
<seg id="57">I became the perverted dirty one.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How have sexual intercourse the Tories?", asked one.</seg>
<seg id="59">"They give a beating to each other the first to the other one, not?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt in the same way that should have been felt the homosexuals before the liberal law of the sixties.</seg>
<seg id="61">Could it take any day a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Would I see me obliged to remaining with people who thought as me only after the nightfall?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should it make me related to the Labor Party and repress my natural trends?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years that they waited for me they presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only head of department openly Tory was Norman Stone, Teacher of Contemporary History destined for my university school.</seg>
<seg id="66">They hated him because they were that they wrote its speeches to him not only of the conservative party, but also advisor of Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people.</seg>
<seg id="67">It was hardly for there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He detested the place for his considering it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of the history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 it accepted a chair in the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you are not going to be happy", said me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">Myself started to be displaced daily of Oxford home of my fathers in London, finding shelter in my relatives and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told to my father that it hated Oxford and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">He did not think me.</seg>
<seg id="74">When he studied there in the forties, all the political points of view were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But if it is the best place of the world", it said with sorrow.</seg>
<seg id="76">"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream-like needles.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude".</seg>
<seg id="78">Its aching eyes started to cloud over.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Give him another opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure of their having made it alone to joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">The heart would be broken up me if you left it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Run up of so many journeys to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed at the pressure and had renounced its creed.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week, during a seminar in which another head of department of History had insinuated that I was an "enemy of the people", talking totally seriously, I decided to make the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Red of shame inside, I admitted that my fathers had "washed" me "the brain" and called them "stupid old men people".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The truce lasted little time.</seg>
<seg id="87">He was my father that put the last nail in the coffin of my university race in Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the press of Murdoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I was scary inside huddled up and, passed five minutes, my persecutors gave up.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left I made the suitcase and took the first train from London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never went back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">Perhaps you call me weak cry-baby.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no person of 18 years should be seen subdued to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">What is still more tragic is that it was Oxford, that it has not only formed 14 first ministers of the conservative party but, today, it hides after a not at all deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"Valentino prefers the elegance to the fame"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For the occasion of the sample "Valentino: Teacher of the Seam", who this week in London has been inaugurated, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to receive an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.</seg>
<seg id="4">The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Teacher of the Seam", a huge retrospective that brings together more than 130 dresses of high seam created by its "maison" during the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I adore this palace", says with its unmistakable Italian accent.</seg>
<seg id="6">This sample is the colophon of a history whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without its distinguished customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino has always felt fascination for the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first room of this exhibition, opened up to the 3 of March, personal letters and photos with the signature of more what has been seeded of the aristocracy abound, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan up to Lord Snowdon, passing Marie-Chantal of Greece and Daisy of England for the Princess.</seg>
<seg id="9">Valentino shows those personal memories as trophies of its social rise: of humble fashion designer of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to idol of the international "jet-set-set".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Being fallen in love with the royalty does not have anything of bad one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"At least they do not turn the stubs of its cigarettes on your magnificent carpet off as they do some beautiful celebrities of the pop music", says the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the sixties and seventies, we both lived in Alps and were good friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">Valentino is a spectacular host and is entertaining with generosity and elegance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All loved us their being invited to its chalet in Gstaad", explains the exwoman of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of beauties forgotten as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.</seg>
<seg id="15">Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">And still like this, is a star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Valeria Mazza, exhibiting a Valentino</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget either the charisma of the fashion designer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dine to its flat.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were twenty people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr were.</seg>
<seg id="21">In every detail of the flat, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything it was seen and its spirit was felt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"To each of the guests it did us to feel important and dear", remembers the "top model", which started to work with it during the Week of High Seam of Paris, in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art", finishes off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Parade of lineage</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of well corresponded loves.</seg>
<seg id="26">He loves the people with good education and better titles, and they love to it.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous footbridge of sixty meters of long that it suggests a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade for the footbridge to contemplate to a dream-like "audience" that exhibits masterpieces of Valentino, as the dress that chose Jackie Kennedy for its wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the wardrobe that used Monica Vitti in "The Notte", or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.</seg>
<seg id="28">In that public of dummies names as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Noruega, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofía de Habsburgo, glitter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, in 2006</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Many of those customers say that the first Valentino is as the first love, "impossible to forget".</seg>
<seg id="31">I remember it perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was some trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat "gillette" and a jacket of the collection fall-winter 1971-1972.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was a gift that did me he", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I prefer it to it above others for its femininity, for its great love to the women, because it enhances our beauty", adds the ex duchess of Feria.</seg>
<seg id="35">I like the colors that he uses a lot, they have big light and they are "donors" to the face.</seg>
<seg id="36">The proportions are perfect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The princess and prescriptora in fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time that dressed a Valentino.</seg>
<seg id="38">When it was adolescent and lived in Italy, it dreamed to get to have the age and the occasion to be able to use one of its evening dresses...</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally the hour arrived at the end of the nineties.</seg>
<seg id="40">I bought my first dress of Valentino to use in a party in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was a red suit, with skirt of ones blown up, draped "corsage" and word neckline of honor.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was a dream brought about", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino is indifferent in fashion, its obsession is what is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat that lives among Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="44">The princess D'Arenberg puts away its dresses of party of the fashion designer with "the maximum cares... because a dress is not only one dress, it is also the ensemble of memories that it entails".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The "king" of the fashion</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in its wedding with Pablo of Greece in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="47">Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as it calls the fashion designer to its seamstresses) to elaborate that silky suit were needed ivory color with inlays of pearls, twelve types of fitting different and a queue of four meters and a half.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, maximum authority of the technical press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of ends of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Bewildered for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now its best copy.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of higher range in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et you give Lettres, honored with the Honor Legion, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the couples of its customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"Its refinement, its calm, its tidy and perfect aspect has always caught me the attention", recognizes D'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">The last time that I saw it it was a month in a full dinner in the Museum of Orsay ago.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was in the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.</seg>
<seg id="54">"It was impeccable, the time does not pass for him".</seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest profession of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano stake the life and the health loading 70 kilos of sulfur across steep stone footpaths</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There is people for whom its work is a hell and another that, literally, she works in the hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the 400 miners who earn a living taking sulfur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, is the case of Anto Wijaya in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">For that, it has to take every day up to the fund of its crater down, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the entrails of the Earth solidifies when getting in contact with the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After pulling out big rocks of sulfur, which about 70 kilos in total get to weigh, it hauls them in two baskets of bamboo that it loads on its shoulders across sheer stone footpaths.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are only 250 meters up to the summit of the volcano, which ascends to 2,386 meters of altitude, but it takes the exhausted carriers more than 40 minutes to promote turtle step, keeping the balance and measuring its steps with tact not to be slid and to fall through the precipice.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any stumble-up could cost them the life, as it happened to a French tourist that fell years through the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners of Kawah Ijen gain 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulfur that they extract</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">, They make the way once among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, loading wearisomely the heavy baskets, who walk three kilometers up to the scale that a mining company has situated a little more down, at 1,850 meters of height, above.</seg>
<seg id="11">Is talked about PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that explodes since 1960 the volcano and, never better told, to its workers, to whom he pays 662 Indonesian rupiahs (5 cents of euro) for every kilo of sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Afterwards it sells it for 10,000 rupiahs (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in the daily life and it is used to fabricate matches, fireworks, cosmetic, dynamite and even to whiten the sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As what is normal is to load 70 kilos, we take about 46,000 rupiahs (3.8 euros) in every journey ", explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily demeanors, to us.</seg>
<seg id="14">It takes three hours in each and finishes ground, but they allow him to join 138,000 rupiahs (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although a misery seems for that is so inhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The day's wage of the miners is very high here, where the collection of the coffee is paid the day at 15,000 rupiahs (1.2 euros) and the monthly average salary is of two million rupiahs (167 euros)", clarifies the carrier, which before worked as bricklayer in the touristic island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, its salary was of 75,000 rupiahs (6.2 euros) per day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with its family to Banyuwangi, some people near to the volcano, for a weighty reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as the sulfur: "I married a youngster of Bali, where they are Hinduist, and I have brought it to Java so that she converts to the Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it coughs constantly and the eyes are irritated for him by the toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">At its 27 years, Anto takes three staking the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started to take its toll on it despite the face with a mask and special glasses being covered.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it coughs constantly and the eyes are irritated for him by the toxic gases that the volcano gives off.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is the price that it must pay to obtain its dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work two years more because I want to open a store or to study Spanish or French", promises in one English more that acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished by the life, this nice and intelligent youngster could be a touristic guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead of that he does the work of a mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other carriers, every day at two in the dawn is lifted because the sulfur does not stop flowing by night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadows, Anto lowers to the crater being lit with a small flashlight stuck to its helmet, which he himself has bought with its money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur on its shoulders from the fund of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In spite of its abundant profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the sulfur to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the carriers, that they work for its account and to so much the weight.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, part of the 30,000 rupiahs (2.5 euros) of surcharge for cameraman not even see that, beside the entry of 15,000 rupiahs (1.2 euros), the guards of this nature reserve charge the tourists who go to photograph the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the beasts and" a well-built carrier of 42 years that takes decades in the Kawah Ijen three, since it left the school, "does not give birth" to the people", protest Madrusin.</seg>
<seg id="30">Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, assures that it will last working "all what can" because it needs the money to educate its three children, of between 18 and 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulfur burns the throat and it stings the eyes when the wind changes unexpectedly and catches the miners in the thick columns that go out of the volcano, are so hard that none complain of suffering severe illnesses... further on, of course, of its usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and sores in the shoulders, that themselves have malformado for the weight of the baskets.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It can seem unbelievable that these verses belong to an advertisement of tablets of mint, but in spite of that - or perhaps due to that - the video turned viral in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The sentences belong to a rap that uses local references as "We are going to put a crossbeam (bun) in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate of Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The company of publicity that the video, BBH, did cherishes the hope that with the advertisement they manage to catch the attention on the problem in an amusing way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that it wanted to use the power of the music so that the people comply with "his to owe national".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This is something purely of internet, so we had to make him amusing and cute.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst of the world in reproducing ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried many things, as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing evening parties of fast appointments (speed-dating).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of those ideas can have been creative, but they not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we think, why do we not make the most creative possible thing to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The one that does not take it so quickly is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It uses up US$1.300 to the year in policies to encourage the citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A packet of the government for marriages and fathers grants up to 15,000 dollars for child, extends the licenses for maternity and divides up fiscal profits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the southeast of Asia, also acquaintance for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national division of population, is situated at present in 1.2 children for woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time that was above 2 -known as rate of replacement- it was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As soon as why do the Singaporeans not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">So Wei Ming, manageress of Policies of Marriage and Family of the National Division of Population, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of opportunities of race".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"That has allowed to the people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, apart from being married and forming a family", explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in the social norms have contributed to the increase of the bachelorhood, and to delay the marriage and the births, which gives a decrease of the birth rate as result in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, a policy of immigration tip ue to increase drastically the immigration to face it to the decrease in population has created resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are web sites where the hardly disguised xenophobia abounds against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who they criticize for maintaining the low salaries and not integrating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase of the immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which last year the government party of Singapore experienced its worst electoral result from the independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">From the choices there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the fees and higher taxes for the foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Whereas the fall in the birth rate has effects known in the economic growth of a nation, the fiscal admissions, the sanitary costs and the policies of immigration, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government tries that so many small homes are not built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it has started to affect the property sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authority of urban development has happened to control the number of small apartments, known as "box of shoes", that can be built in specific areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have had a lot of best seller.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is worry that they can promote a way of life of bachelorhood and big homes, familiar, discourage the developers who want to build.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the property company THE Developers, says that its "boxes of shoes" are sold much faster than the greatest units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense of the units being used days, even weeks, up faster than the units of biggest size.</seg>
<seg id="40">This makes it be much better for our cash flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new norms give clearer directions for the developers, who before were fettered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stressed out</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the national birth rate, when talking with the Singaporeans that they work in the financial district of the center it seemed that they are not going to have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"The people are very stressed out, the homes are expensive and is also it the education, for what many people are it postponing", says an executive youngster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have my own money and time", says another youngster of about 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention its race, the stress and the cost of the properties and of the education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So, for a lot that the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it is a matter of doing babies, the Singaporeans are those who have the last word.</seg>

<seg id="7">elPeriódico interviewed five boys out of ten and 15 years, frequent users of the net.</seg>
<seg id="8">In four of the cases, they associated the term to "something very mine", in the personal plan, and "in the key and username", when they applied it to social nets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My deepest secrets it would not go up them to one post", says Jorge, of ten years, when it tries to explain the meaning of deprived in places as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has accounts since two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They are very secret secrets, my mummy can know them, but not all the world", states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In FB I raise images pretty or of games.</seg>
<seg id="12">I also entertain myself with my acquaintances.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It would not share a photo that is not mine, or of somebody that is doing the ridicule", says.</seg>
<seg id="14">The child recognizes that it is unwell to publish obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge assures to know the 35 friends that it has in FB and its nine followers in Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority are related.</seg>
<seg id="17">The mother is included, has the key of one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">I opened Twitter to express to me and to write interesting tweets.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I do not know if they answer me, I alone go up them", adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="21">It does not doubt to answer that it would never accept an application for an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nor he would pay attention to somebody who recommended him a stranger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of José, of 14 years, is different.</seg>
<seg id="24">The adolescent possesses open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter last one admits not knowing 20 of the people added in its list of friends.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It does not frighten me, because we have, the music for example a little in common", indicates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">According to the boy, none have made advances to him nor have asked it for the address of its home or its telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If they pressed me or required it to me simply I take them of my account", recognizes.</seg>

<seg id="38">"Although I know that that is a cyberbullying", it states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Key questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, teacher of English and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that in order to orientate the children and the adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of the social nets is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Internet rose as a means to look for information, but with the aparecimiento of these places changed the rules of the game", mentions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras indicates that the academician Marc Prensky, master in Pedagogy through the University of Yale and author of the Natives work and Digital Immigrants, minted these terms to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives are they, the children and youngsters who were born with the technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are the digital immigrants that have to show to them to them, when we are still learning", says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them an age that the maturity does not give for them to have a defined criterion about it is convenient either what not to spread, to publish or to say for that".</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also that they are selective when what more imports them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, the most effective way of showing children and adolescents what is privacy is through questions that make them reflect.</seg>
<seg id="48">"To tell them that it does not do it does not serve", adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Next, Porras enumerates some options: There are things that you would not tell to a stranger, why do you make it in the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">O, would you like them to publish a photo of you as the one that you published of a friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the other ones publish on you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When photo labels of parties, did you ask the other people for license to label them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more, all need to know the what you are making every moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to make them see it online that they must act as off line make it.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, in the same way it must be in the social nets", states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Surveillance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, university head of department, teacher of primary one and educational consultant, comments that it is indispensable that the family fathers read the policies of the social nets to conscience.</seg>
<seg id="59">When understanding each of the digressions they have solid bases to converse with its children on the implications of opening an account in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, the age and what is it allowed sharing or publishing", says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Guard, it is key to remind the children of the lesson of "do not talk with strangers".</seg>

<seg id="1">He finishes Summit of the Unasur without making the Declaration of Lima public</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The VI presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima, announced previously and theoretically subscribed by the seven attendant leaders, being made public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Efe tried in repeated opportunities to enter the document signed in the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and of Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellery and of Presidency indicated in a beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but stated afterwards that in some moment it will be published in the web of the Peruvian Government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">When being consulted by the text, they indicated that the contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during some brief declarations to the press.</seg>
<seg id="5">The access of the journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During the day alone was transmitted, in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the "session" message "private, audio restricted".</seg>
<seg id="7">The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the spokesmen of press of some of the governments of the Unasur attendant to the appointment, although not the Peruvian.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The only document spread during the day was the list of attendant presidents, which caused the uneasiness of hundreds of journalists of different national and international means that asked for bigger data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Later, the Presidency of Peru e-mailed the means with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about the pronouncement of Humala, and not about the official document that closed the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In last October, Peru was the host of the III Summit South America-Countries Árabes (CROSS), and on that occasion, despite being required insistently by the press, the also called Declaration of Lima that previously they had announced was not spread either.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the official web of CROSS it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made an effort in that there were transmission systems guaranteed for all the journalists but they limited the obtaining of information to the utmost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The summit concluded also with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru of accepting a failure of the Court of The Hague that annuls a frontier diferendo between both countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, were brought together during the regional appointment and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), that starts Monday in The Hague to listen to the pleas of both parts, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"We will abide and we will execute the sentence that defines the differences that nowadays we are taking to this international court", said Humala, beside its Chilean couple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Chile has been, is and is going to keep being a respectful country of the international law, of the pacific solution of the controversies, of the treaties and of the international tribunals", added Piñera, and greeted with a handshake Humala, beside the flags of both countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The confirmation of both presidents that they will be submitted to the CIJ happened afterwards that Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá for which it had agreed to submitting to the failures of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered severely wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The summit was carried out with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.</seg>
<seg id="19">Paraguay, suspended of Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its ex president Fernando Lugo, did not share the appointment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The hosting president, Ollanta Humala, was the person in charge to open the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit, little after the midday of Lima.</seg>
<seg id="21">The leader read the final document in the one that it informed that were adopted 16 agreements and were fixed the lines of action for 31 projects among the South American countries for a total of 17 a billion dollars in investments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Among the adopted agreements he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It informed that impulse is given to actions to improve "the cooperation in the fight against the insecurity and against the trasnacional organized crime, actions to do more accessible the medicines, the access to the internet to low price in all the corners of South America, and to attend to the risks of natural disasters in a joint and efficient way".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve for extending nustra productive matrix and glimpsing a better future for our people", added Humala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and of fronteras...uniendo to our countries and generating new economic circuits", said the Peruvian president in a read message.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Among those projects, it mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and estan located in the transversal axes of his territory, from the coast towards Brazil, and two they point to a bigger connection with Ecuador, although it did not give bigger details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Likewise, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We wait for the electoral process in that country serving for its re-incorporation into the Union of Nations South American", of which it is at present excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The need that Latin America keeps as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbors, was another of the matters underlined by the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said the maritime diferendo before initiating its participation in the regional appointment that he expected to be met with its couple of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal in a respectful form after a failure of the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"On the day of tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible that it has a meeting with the president Daniel Ortega", said Saints.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We are going to revise all these paths, are not exclusive, inclusively the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua", underlined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"With the president Ortega I expect to be able to tell him that we operate this of the most civilized and respectful form possible", added Santos.</seg>
<seg id="34">Saints and Sandgrouse would find Saturday in Mexico where they plan on attending the taking of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Likewise, as part of the summit, the ministers of Defense of the block met previously to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which it looks for strengthening the dialogue and the consensus on the subject of Defense in the region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.</seg>
<seg id="37">Peru has the presidency pro témpore of the regional block.</seg>

<seg id="1">"South America must learn of Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Belt, which took part in the VI presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), celebrated in Lima, declared to the state TV Peru that the Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The project of establishing the South American citizenship that they encourage defended, in that sense, the member countries of the Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The free mobility of citizens and workers through any South American country, as it already happens with the members of the Andean Community, have to be obtained, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Ecuadorian president was shown, besides, in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account to which they have signed the pact of San José on the human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those that ever give chair are jeopardized to nothing and, however, us the South Americans we sign it everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States", stated in allusion to the political asylum given to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, by Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa assured that it is not repented of that decision because with that it has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep values democratic and of human rights".</seg>
<seg id="10">It added that, in its moment, "there were founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and its process was not respected".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He criticized, besides, to the justice Swede because it required it who submits in its territory to the interrogation for a supposed sexual crime when "the Swedish legislation itself allows carrying it out through video conference, which could be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa stated that the risk that the physical and mental health of Assange deteriorates exists.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not talked with it since it is in our embassy, but the ambassadress informed me that it had a small pulmonary problem, nothing severe," said the Ecuadorian leader.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">What yes there is is the danger that its physical and mental health is deteriorated by being locked up in a powerless small space to make open-air exercises.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That complicates the health of any person", added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa indicated that the solution at the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the concession of a salvaconducto that allows Ecuador to travel, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and underlined that there have been conversations with London in search of a solution to the closing of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not deal with human rights, that word we do not use it in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and of the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European applications", mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And he opined that "if Great Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow this runs out".</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as perfectly its legislation allows it and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or questions it way Skype is tomorrow finished this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa made use to be reaffirmed as a defender of the freedom of the press and pointed out that what she does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, which impair the freedom of speech".</seg>
<seg id="22">"We, the oldest enemies of the freedom of the press, are not the wicked and perverse politicians but the bad journalists according to the profit, the blackmail and the extortion", said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In that aspect it was congratulated that any longer they are not these journalists or the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries those that dominate to Ecuador", and anticipated that of being re-elected "it will deepen in the revolution to continue the path and the correct address".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision of the veto maintaining Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to its next choices, when arguing that the organism "must be firm and not tolerating the opportunism and the coated coup of legality" because in fact "it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Ecuadorian president considered, besides, "perfectly pertinent" the desire for its Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, of negotiating now the maritime limits between both countries with Nicaragua after the failure of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, that it benefited to the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the moment that failure is not abided by.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Deaths by AIDS today are a cause of late detection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio had 21 years of age when they confirmed the result of the test to him: Positive Aids.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if a bomb fell me", refers when reminiscing about the moment of the advertisement, which the doctor tried to do "more suavecito", without evident success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy concealed it from its family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to be seen alone of its illness and started to inform itself about it; with such a determination that it already celebrated its birthday 43.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is, undoubtedly, one of the most former patients of the Unit of HIV of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio lives with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (HIV) since 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the nineties, when there were many doubts, few options of treatment and more stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, even the director of a private hospital of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye to it "because it brought a cutover".</seg>
<seg id="9">Then, to have AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to make it with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, ignoramuses of its illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused destructions, its immune system "used up" and are victims of opportunist infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At 31 years of the appearance of the AIDS in the world, at least of the first brought cases, "the great achievement means now that the sobrevida of a patient that initiates treatment in an appropriate form and the sobrevida of the general population, is exactly equal", indicated the head of the Unit of HIV of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was answered for in April of this year in a publication enhanced scientist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infectologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since the year 2008, the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of overexperiences and the quality of life depend of the degree of affectation to the immune system that the patients present when initiating the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not users of drugs: of even 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and of 50 years, when they bring 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In simple words, the previous means that the one who receives the positive diagnosis of HIV at the 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as it keeps in control he will be able to live troublefree until the 75 years", explained the interviewed one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to measure this advance, one may remember that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is of 76 years on average.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality has lowered significantly in the last years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people that die of AIDS lowered of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is also true that from the appearance of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths go until May of this year; however it is assured that there is universal access to the antirretrovirales drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why do there keep being deaths?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - It seems to me that the problem is not of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">Like this I view it, like this it has succeeded us in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the last 12 years we have not had desupplying of medicine the problem is that the patients arrive very advanced because they do not know its state of infection, that is, in late stages of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It gave a strong data: "Nine of every ten patients arrive when they already present some opportunistic infection the that it has to be done to have a bigger impact on the global mortality, is to do earlier diagnoses and, therefore, tests of detection in a massive way have to be offered, to all the people that require it".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal specialists and civil servants of the State Board of Advice of Prevention of the AIDS in Jalisco coincide (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who went to do the test to a particular laboratory, only motivated to because it had done it a friend and, in spite of its short age, it was already in AIDS stage and even it suffered sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I am already going to die, I better burst three times per week", say not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was to improve, I feed well, I do exercise, I take the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">To the date, its fathers only know that cancer suffered.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, as any.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active, but corresponsable sexual life, I take care to me and to the other person", enumerated Fabrizio, the one who accepted to share its privacy with MILLENNIUM JALISCO to motivate with its testimony to those who today, within the framework of the World Day of AIDS, have fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">That the test is done, if they had risk, that between sooner know if they are HIV positive, is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live as any person, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">That one, its message, summarizes the motto of battle to AIDS this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms after the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Big are the hollows that there are among the health programs and the common citizen, held Ricardo Salazar, tapatío journalist who has assumed the cause about the HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the places dedicated to this task "indeed the distribution of condoms has been increased, before gave us of one or two, now give us packets of to a hundred, and that is very well but it works out that there is who today, yet, they do not have access to a condom", said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are the adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"For what you want them?" common question, with slyness and valuable judgments of social workers, school advisers, is employees of drugstores and staff of health, of which the adolescents do not want to run the risk, insured the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; that the condoms are not only after the counters and those hundred are public in despachadores of baths of the places that the youngsters frequent.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not to cause the promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nor it is a matter of paying them the chelas and the motel, as the governor Emilio González answered, when asking him if there would be distribution of condoms in its Administration.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Like this it is not the sexuality, the best thing is to approach the condoms to those who already practice a sexual activity", noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Keys En Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13.435 cases accumulated (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state is 4° national place in cases new and accumulated of AIDS and 13° of HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the infections corresponds to the sexual way, to 6% to the blood way and to 2% to the perinatal way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Itself esteem that 50 a thousand people can be living with HIV since for a registered case there are from 4 to 5 people that do not know it.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A sentence that does not know ratified by a court of appeals of the United States the restructures of the debt of the Group Vitro achieved via a mercantile competition in Mexico, the stage places an awful precedent for any domestic enterprise with ramifications in the adjacent country that has solvency problems.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It would be said, then, that the procedures in endorsement of overexperiences of the signatures that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, the opposite way of international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the practical ground, the support to the sentence emitted on 15 of June passed by the judge Harlin Hale of the court of Bancarrotas for the north district of Texas, leaves helpless to the Mexican signatures in the face of the possibility of embargo of its properties in beyond the Brave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the resolution opens the door to the main one manufacturer of glass in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">For a start, while the judge of the cause indicates that the creditors must be ruled by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit, with headquarters in New Orleans, he says that the main procedure is the mercantile competition carried out in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would imply not knowing the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with trasnacional profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, towards that end was created the Model Law of United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Commercial Law, the American Law Institute being placed as referee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In the second place, the sentence establishes that without the vote intercompanies, recognized in the critical mass of the mercantile competition the debts that had with its matrix the subsidiaries of Vitro, the majority required to pass had not been achieved the restructures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the Mexican laws recognize the possibility.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, that of Vitro has not been the first case in which the schema is accepted.</seg>
<seg id="11">There half a dozen of examples are, among them Agremex and Commercial Mexican, whose intercompany debts the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions answered for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">What is true, besides, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro that fought against this one in the Courts of the United States, that is the funds "vulture" as Aurelios Capital, Convergence Aurelios, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have been of 45 per cent against 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Court of appeals omits the data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another angle, this one blames to Vitro of the difficult situation that confronted from 2008 to I overcome of the severe economic crisis that confronted the United States, sticking the wags of the tail for her to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For a start, the signature of the family González Sada will lodge a reconsideration resource before the court of appeals itself so that the vote arrives to the plenary session of this one, that is the five magistrates, since three only voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of not prospering this one will be claimed the resource of Cerciorare that requires the revision of the process on the part of a superior application, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">What is severe of the case is that the court placed a document sideways sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the frame of the Law of Mercantile Competitions is detailed, 15 of the Law of Bankruptcies of the United States indicating that this one was vented this one with the chapter with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to draw.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Globetrotter of the basketball Héctor Hetin Kings was more than 60 years tied up with the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to it, the entire world traveled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor Hetin Kings has it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">AND is that before that a cerebral loss confined it to a wheelchair in the 2008, Reyes it was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, was as player of smaller categories, player of the National, empowered and leading Superior Basketball in the BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">I "put on many hats in the basketball through my life, including several to the same time, as when it was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the years 90," it reminded its home of Kings during a visit of Primera Hora in Bayamón, where lives with Isabel, its faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The basketball has been my life".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes does not exaggerate when doing that assertion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of its home, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias that denote its wide trajectory, like this they vouch for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Of all of them, those that it possesses with bigger emotion are those that reminisce about its step for the Cowboys from the middle of the decade of the fifties as player up to 1982, when it celebrated 15 fungiendo years as corepresentative or representative of the exemption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Those were my best years, those that I enjoyed more myself because I had the opportunity of belonging to eight championships of the Cowboys since 1967, it was already as representative, co-empowered or leading.</seg>
<seg id="12">They were many years of satisfactions, including the five championships moved since 1971 up to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And afterwards I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Of there from now on it was done charge "Cuckoo" Ortiz, which was a great administrator", indicated Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Gene Bartow, who it had directed here and was in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told to me: "I have you a well strong player, of 6" 7" of stature.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want it?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow recommended the sniper afterwards Raymond Gausse, which was nativizado and was one of our best handles.</seg>
<seg id="19">Memory which he said that if Mincy had given a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help another bring more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse had it to himself, but, then for 1988 already it already to the distance appeared as federative bigwig.</seg>
<seg id="21">For that time he preferred enjoying its enforceable judgments and those of Mincy in the National Team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember the United States when we beat to him for the first time during the Preolímpico in Mexico of 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Afterwards the World Championship of 1990 came, where we arrive fourth place and had to have been bronze of not being for that Canadian referee that did us to repeat the final move for the second time, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Is that group of the World Championship of 1990 the best National Team that you have seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, as the one that beat him at the Dream Team in the Olympiads of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favourite was the of the Pan-American in Cuba in 1991, when we gain gold and we gave it one peels the team of the United States, which the bronze was quite similar to the one that gained us in the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">That team not alone repeated To Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young, to the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and to Mario "Quixote" Moralities, which had not been able to be in the 90 due to an injury in the knee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the Preolímpico of the 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With role players as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and one juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner in substitution of the players suspended by the mess of the Pan-American of Sea of the Silver, we gain gold against all the predictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Which has been the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">With no doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its numbers as for international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated Piculín at that level as he made it.</seg>
<seg id="34">And that without saying its trajectory in the different leagues that played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who has been the best boricua leader?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the youngsters, I like the work of Leo Arill a lot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Which do you consider your biggest achievement in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Having belonged to the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the nineties the BSN had teams up to 17 in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What remained you for doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things which he had wanted to implement, as the regionalization of the smallest categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that the boys of Ponce alone played in its area and alone confronted teams of other corners of the Island in the national play-offs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Right now the children travel and play too much unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the fruit of the compulsorias certifications and course for leaders, officers of table and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">That pleases me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you make now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">How more I do is to listen to music, to see videos of the music of my period in YouTube, to enjoy me to my grandchildren and from time to time to go to games of basketball.</seg>
<seg id="49">And clear, to enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been with me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">They initiate course that explores the "End of the world"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week, the students explore apocalyptic subjects as the nuclear warfare, the zombies, the viruses and germs, and the global heating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This semester, when the teacher in religion Stuart Charmé decided to impart a course on the end of the world, he knew that he said with an irresistible fish hook: The end of the "long regressive account" of the Mayan Calendar, the 21 of December, which many people as a test that is come the end of the world have clung to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Charmé did not have idea about what waited for him in the following couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "deudarmagedón" and an increasing conflict that involves Israel, the place where the Christian theoreticians of the end of the times think that the Apocalypse will begin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did not realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that there has been", said Charmé this week to the students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If one analyzes what has been happening in the world nowadays as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a period good really.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not an only teacher that offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last one of the history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In Temper, the associate professor Barry Vacker is imparting the course "Means, Culture and the end of the world".</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week, the students explore apocalyptic subjects as the nuclear warfare, the zombies, the viruses and germs, and the global heating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze why these ideas proliferate with time", said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical stages that guide a certain human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic subjects and explored how they are compared with examples of the real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have tried to inform the students on what is possible, probable, believable and impossible", said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the teacher of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and its colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have made team to impart a course, titled only the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We do not add '2012" always to have with the option of imparting the course again, if the world" is not "finished", said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In spite of the "imminent ruin", the students must study, generate projects and take final examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In Penn State, the final examination will be taken in day before of the Apocalypse, what does not leave to the students one option more to work "until the same night in which it is meant that the world finishes", said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses were quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It "was saturated in two hours", said Restall on its course for students with high average, which filled up with 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We receive messages for electronic mail for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, of people who asked if there was still place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students, for its part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It is me fascinating to see what the people to comfort to itself do", said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, is only a question of consolation or of the absence of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Wekesa, a student of the race of Psychology and Nursing, of 25 years, made out that he had seen all the apocalyptic films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"It had never listened on a class that could show that", indicated.</seg>
<seg id="27">I enjoy it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no student had an interview - and a lot except a teacher - made out that he believed in the expiry date of the 21st of December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and in a certain way discredit it", said Julie Zeglen, student of last year in Temper, of 21 years and of West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Mayan ones never predicted the end of the world; a key issue is so alone in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But marked out that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in the occidental culture, which goes back to several centuries, in that the people react to the changes around you predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">Internet has caused an apogee of these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"On other sides the people do not think about this", said.</seg>
<seg id="34">In mainly in the world of English speech.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a teacher of religion of the University La Salle that imparts courses in the Philippines this year, answered quickly to the question of whether it knew on any course on the "end of the world" there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world", wrote, insinuating an exception of a superior authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon of the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall made notice that throughout the years it has been talked about many days of the final judgment, and said that if does not pass anything on 21 of December, "the people will start to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophize that on 21 of December is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will run out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers are taking the date quickly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several said that they think to go to parties "of the end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"It perhaps calls to some friends so that we laugh together", commented on Samira Ford, student of communications of 20 years.</seg>
