<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican Party against Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify their policy is a necessity of the fight against electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennan's Centre, however, such a scam known as the myth that the electoral fraud in the US is less frequent than the number of people who will die after lightning struck.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers for the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, part of the measures will undermine the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada have a responsibility for the organisation in the US federal elections individual states.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in this spirit of most American governments since 2009, new laws that make it difficult to the process of elections, or write to the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only for 2011 presented 180 proposals of the restrictive electoral law in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral law requires voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, supersede the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the elections and taking away the right to vote to citizens in a criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006, did not require the electorate půkazu identity card with a photograph of any U.S. state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first state, who led this requirement, it was Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutionality of the law indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican offices with the enlargement of the procedure as well as to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states, with the aim of forcing voters to submit their identity cards with photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, in contrast to the Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, half-11% of American citizens, i.e. the 21 million people aged to vote, no identity card with a photograph issued by a government authority of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, does not have an identity card, about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are disproportionately affects mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years old, therefore, does not have the required identity card with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, who are as voters known for their shift to Democratic candidates, are not in several States entitled to use his identity card with a photograph of his school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs, who elect more Republican candidates, the cards issued by the use of these clubs in the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, no state in the election did not require proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such a requirement introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011 about a dozen states adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">The measures aim to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.</seg>
<seg id="31">Indeed, should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators in 2011, supported laws in eight states, which cancelled registration of voters on the day of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those restrictions have their consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register around 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken after 2009 but caused the decline in registering new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican lawmakers in the other five states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008 to Florida were African-American 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the same for Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">They were only 11% of all voters, but the 24% of the citizens of voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of the total electorate, were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Against the approval of laws, which restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly Democratic legislators and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors veto blocked several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">With a view to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">Part of them have managed to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, the laws requiring the submission of identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly introduced rules, however, undeniably difficult in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics talking mainly about bias approved laws and is considered to be an obvious attempt to influence the outcome of the elections in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">Brennan's Centre of 2011 report shows that the states where those laws have been approved, account for 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed for victory in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, part of the measures will undermine the American democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detection of prostate cancer: Complete examination or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">PSA test was sometimes inaccurate results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="3">All this has increased the reluctance of the men who are no longer so reluctant to go at all.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let's investigate or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked two experts on view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies carried out in the US has shown a high degree of contamination between the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the European, said different mortality rates among patients who have undergone tests, and those who didn't go to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also showed the 12letém detachment that those who don't have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The men are also vulnerable group with African origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision, as soon as the cancer is discovered.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive forms of cancer and such species, which are inert.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to explain the patient the hazard of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, do not treat prostate cancer, which is not in the long-term impact on the lives and focus in these cases, the more active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men, for which she was diagnosed with cancer, not a cure, as their kind of cancer is not an aggressive and threatens to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, they propose the implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater precision setting criteria that help in deciding which type of healing and which don't.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, I recommend testing.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is important, but interviews with the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo tests or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created Movember movement tool, which allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with PSA testing.</seg>

<seg id="21">Disease prevention</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the advances in research seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease the adoption of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving, it could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If they stop smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," underscores the Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for Canadian companies for cancer research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancer causing heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some percentage also remains unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian company for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also risk factor for a few more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman Andre Beaulieu shaking his head.</seg>
<seg id="33">An encouraging indication: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, decreasing the risk of cancer deaths by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Mass</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the SCC appeared and obesity are another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommended to reduce consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">When too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is appropriate to avoid the sausages, which is the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Smoked meat canning, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"May cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent days, various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, research has revealed a clear conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies talk more about the increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D to cancer is not clearly shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"To submit to testing does not mean that you have cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgs boson explored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The notification of the likely discovery of the Higgs bosonu last summer the commotion.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that the bosons are involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And this is the last particle whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Among the physicists, however, so far there is no 100 percent certainty that it is the Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">Doubts about the fact that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as is predicted the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">The new data published this week during a physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm, however, there are no longer any data, so that we can have absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, the Higgs boson, assume that this is because the risk of error appears to be small, and look at what's happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world is completely unambiguous law, according to which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard, otherwise you're gonna get hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" roughly speaking, creates some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Particle physicists further divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently comply with Pauli principles.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end of the moving bosony, mean-spirited anarchists, who weighs nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they may well be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratories: Mesony, here we go unnoticed, and "containment" particles, which are spreading a large natural forces and the Higgs boson, which is probably related in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, should be to say that these are not bosony so exotic pets, as it would have been possible to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you read this article, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual banality: Photon, or particle of light, "which is" a "electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the particles with an electrical charge to accelerate or to change its direction, "interrupted" by electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "distraction" electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this is nothing other than the photon - and thus one of bosonů, "holders of power."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Also, it is with the Higgs bosonem, with the difference that "disturb" should be another field, Higgsovo field that the boson appeared.</seg>
<seg id="22">This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; the excitation is necessary to achieve a very high energy values, like the frozen surface of a pond, no longer moves a lot of a large boulder.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part of the accelerator CERN Hadron Collider as the accelerator in the lab - a big, friendly ties is a circle with a circumference 27 km! - in order to develop a power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field suits us once again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and stuff.</seg>
<seg id="25">Responding to the electromagnetic field because not all the particles and all the materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be by myself to keep on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the same applies to respond with the Higgs field all the particles: Those that do have some mass, while others (such as, for example, a photon, look at him) don't have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Mrs. Smith asks, what all of these studies are, what they bring to us, ""?</seg>
<seg id="29">From the point of view of science is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, more than a few physicists have literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and to close some of the loopholes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It should be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, does not provide any clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which account for about 80% of the cosmic mass (oops!).</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, however, CERN installations such contradictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Response</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The response of these research in everyday life, Mr. and Mrs. Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Behold: The early 1960s had laser pioneers in the Bell Labs no idea of the revolution, their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulse) in 1962, I've already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy in the lab."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And, in addition, may be the result of all instruments that surround research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle has created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The sensor, even though it Boyle initially planned, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, it does not mean that the activities around the LHC we necessarily have to change your life, but it means that, you never really know.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Commission, through its for decent dying Quebek recently engaged in a delicate issues relating to the end of his life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should continue, and at the same time, the bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this crucial area there is still a lot of work to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">The magazine Le devoir tried to look at the issue in more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me five years of his life, and now it's seven," he said without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has done its work: Extreme weakness makes it impossible to remove himself to go to the bathroom, or to eat alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Looking at the appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a brave and even smiles, talking with strangers who stop, brings his medication, offer a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of a death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, the demeaning to me," she says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later he found a team of doctors on his problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In all his life and learn that the men standing in the urine," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the facility Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Return to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on the skills of the man's" whether to accept the return, says psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the number of people who are involved in palliative care, the crucial moments are taking place at the very core of such a return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who are stepping into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">The forecast is a maximum of three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage of the team of doctors and nurses caring for them, provide the so-called "therapeutic" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years, is the worst fear to die of suffocation conscious. "</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease to their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I've got good kids," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no desire in my life," he says, and then says to her breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet he still enjoys in the coming days on the last visit to the son of Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The home of the Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers providing care for the body with the help of nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">It looks like palliative care, which is, if you cannot do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">That death was more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Québeku seems a bed palliative care to 11 700 people.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's very little, if we realise that we all have to die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the medics at home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whatever the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you die, you can give him, for example, a sip of brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics are no longer required to keep an eye on the level of sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is a part of everyday life here.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night, carrying beer, Mr X, who later died in the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, drinks beer his son in honor of the late father.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The home of the Victor-Gadbois coming days, one after the other, but not like each other.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to the 93-year old man, who was from the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while toasting his honor, dying tragically 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children after he tried all the possibilities for it to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For half a year, there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martelová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients who come to the home Victor-Gadbois, coming up from their homes, 47% of hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering, as soon as it comes into the final phase of his life, whether it's at home, in a hospital or in a halfway house.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Company for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize in more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And it is precisely this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to the fact that many doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed in palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard LaPointe, in which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec health care system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to high-quality palliative care, before it will be possible to agree with the implementation of the euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, has recently experienced a patient who had spent 14 days on standby in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="52">He fears that patients do not ask about the death on the grounds that they are not getting appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And, at the same time, it is true that many oncologists care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative forecast.</seg>
<seg id="54">The hope of survival Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, when she left intensive chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my onkoložce quit with the treatment, said she regrets that I'm fighting, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">And he told me that it's over!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martelová estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanking his treating physicians to fill their wishes, when their team palliative Javier eased the pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it is necessary to say that palliative care is not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care in the Society for domestic palliative care area of Grand Montréal, patients hinders treatment of pain in the 8% of the cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of his life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until death, whatever fits and starts, or whether they are the sedative administered on a permanent basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Unable to pretend that this part of the suffering we perceive.</seg>
<seg id="63">The patient, whom we don't get rid of pain, it will have more access to paliativním sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">The sick, which is not provided a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia" means, "I want you to get rid of me pain."</seg>

<seg id="15">Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Lino Zambito caused a sensation when it was published by the Commission explaining the mechanism, "" acquisition of public procurement system.</seg>
<seg id="17">He gave during these years 3% of the value of the contracts, which gained Montréalu, associated with the Mafia, then transferring the money side of the Union Montréal, for which he ran the mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>

<seg id="25">On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montréal into large-scale crisis.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="32">As a cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">On a regular basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned, in particular the role of "members of the well-informed about this ruse," if these game-playing them!</seg>
<seg id="35">It is estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and with the irony, he adds: "I have heard that it is only a weak brew of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it will not resolve the situation: "As long as the severely restrict election expenses, dirty money from politics will not disappear."</seg>
<seg id="37">It proposes a comprehensive control system of public procurement and funding of parties: "We can no longer fall; focusing boldly to the substance of things, we can build on more solid foundations and with greater control and compliance with the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If the story defamed image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends all those who deride him to look at his own backyard.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season with PSG put an entirely new pace.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this development?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into himself, or completely new dimension PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">They came to us the big players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day, I'm getting beside them further.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical team helped me a lot, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every day I allow these facts to raise the level of the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football, things are going very fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">But don't lose my head.</seg>
<seg id="12">From my beginnings in prep school in the INF Clairefontaine after transfer to Saint-Etienne, I was always pushed for each grade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Using the competitive environment, which has introduced Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">We also know that every training is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it shows that a player like me, has more flavor to the game, and he wants to make the maximum power.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, and gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti in connection with my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">Claude Makelele, who played the hand's assistants, as it is in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And Ancelotti has the final word in the nick of time?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti has the respect of all of technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, it is not the first league equal and are among the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">Has vast experience, and with the top teams won a lot of titles.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with excellent players.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to me to win more titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I graduated from the comforting conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I was behind a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How are you looking at the first part of the season, PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league Lyon took the position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But staying in tow.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League: Very easily, we moved in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is your club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We'll try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be a match for the quality of European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">First, we want to win its qualifying group before Porto, in order to be able to play in retaliation at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">PSG may be in the short term a major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">The budget is already on it.</seg>
<seg id="40">Paris to become a major European club, he must win titles and write the history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not yet.</seg>
<seg id="42">PSG has the financial means to carry out this plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a big setback nezvítězit 1 in the league in the last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, really want to win league title.</seg>
<seg id="46">We have enough missed last season.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May we were disappointed, because we had to win.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had an excellent season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We picked up 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Usually, it is true that with 79 points you clear the master...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think it will be this year.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even though the title and the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think that we have the weapons to defeat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what was invested here and what our players.</seg>
<seg id="56">It's absolutely accept.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and still find something that we in the newspaper, so it's not very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">A man asks, what else can they want more from you guys.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is not, of course, to win 4-0 on every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We're not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to set up the game-style.</seg>
<seg id="62">You need to build a team.</seg>
<seg id="63">We proved that we can play in the Champions League.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season, and they have invested large sums of money, too!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Due to invested sums you would expect that you have in front of the other 15 points ahead!</seg>
<seg id="66">The insult the other clubs, and the French league.</seg>
<seg id="67">Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in the last season, with a new PSG moved on to the next phase.</seg>
<seg id="68">It shows how wonderful it is 1 League.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as if PSG in all relied on performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that it says that there is a "dependence on Zlatanovi."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that the Ibrahimovič is a very powerful, and that makes a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">That's why he came here, and shows that the star is 1 league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he has demonstrated that he is a great player, a star in the world.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our team we have respect for the man and player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people, which is around.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has achieved is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This has led others to raise their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows the other side-by-side growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you experienced Euro 2012 with the French representation?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I wanted to play this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as well as I would have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="84">But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I've been doing in the entertainment to play good games.</seg>
<seg id="86">And that's what I had hoped for from his team.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves, to our behavior has been exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">How are you looking at the first month Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The results speak for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">We're in a good place in the qualification.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach, the players around and will be able to get for the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">Such was the Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't want to compare them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has reached its goal by the fact that we have qualified for the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">It is a tie (1: 1) of 16 October in Spain with a solid baseline game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game for us added confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">We are all fighting for the team.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before the shock in Spain I experienced such a game in his career.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanks to the Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on the central banks, and the cost of processing transactions identified among the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, as it is in the context of these technologies often true, there is a clear political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro, etc.), so the secure transfer protocol BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between two pairs partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The course bitcoinu first reached the maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, he dropped to 2 dollars, today is on the edge of about $10 (overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products it is not impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on the virtual finance, which came out in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro," and "equal to the current money."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by the fact that it is a "credits" to be used for the procedure in the video game, which gets a game or that he could buy (and sometimes back to replace).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Every month but the central authority of the controls and processes the communication.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes network depositary of current accounts, supervisors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How the network works?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is, in fact, between the two electronic addresses through e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key lies in the minutes of this new transactions in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">Using a mathematical task of the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the stage of the cutting of the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital print.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computer "assume" the new transaction and added to the number, then the whole "cut."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find a number, which gives the impression a lot of zeros (at the start).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as you will find this number, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructible displays linked to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have to change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the user would have wanted for the purpose of fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, which will solve the challenge, to win 50 bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, divided the two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoinů in circulation is limited by the number of 21 million, can be split, however, to the part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the task is also increases with increasing levels of calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network has had its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Web site, which provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked, and there has been an estrangement between imposed bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Used crack does not concern itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, the company for the payment of real money, which uses a network Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering, thanks to this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this problem goes for cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like blogging platform WordPress, is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="40">ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book current accounts, and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů revolving.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, "were launched a huge discounts."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul dealing with the transformation bitcoinů to gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the book on the money, he has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but used for verification system Bitcoin transactions, which are cheaper because of it.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, the winner of the manages its identity and so can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to set for traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is enough to address, which can be a telephone "photograph it and recognize," upřesňuje Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to in a more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before the Bitcoin wins, it's going to take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In its report, the ECB also foresees a reassessment of the various risks, which are now considered to be increased if this kind of money will be successful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Difficult to work on the Egyptian Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Mohammad Mursí went to another poker game.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains in its history the most divided because of the publication of the Constitution, which grants him temporarily unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.</seg>
<seg id="4">He announced on Wednesday, regardless of the opinion of all the others, that the constituent assembly approved the final text.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago by the head of state to this Assembly for another two months to complete the work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For almost two years Egypt used makeshift text, which was supplemented by a number of times, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to the legal argument.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only further strengthen the ambivalence of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposition from the point of view of the president remains in his "autocratic" delirium, "it violates my word," and "tramples on the right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His followers have been assured, however, that it is a means to deal with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transitional process.</seg>
<seg id="10">For two weeks should be a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the Egyptians to clarify the text article by article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president it is also a way of achieving national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country being rocked by protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.</seg>
<seg id="14">In particular, therefore, that this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people with an ultimatum: "Either approve my text, or I'll unlimited powers," which would otherwise have come to an end after the approval of a new constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of a constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists text approved.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the Liberals in the vote was missing.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, bouchli door with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Defenders of human rights, of civil society or members of religious minorities their step.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 people from among the replacements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators have also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes the day centered around the clock for prayer, when some members of the committee were of the opinion that the clock in the conference room is not properly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text on which the vote yesterday evening, is composed of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of the limelight, Article 2, remains the same as with the version of the constitution of 1971 and provides that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term "the principle of" the term "rules," which would allow stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been repaired, is a sign of good will and respect for other parts of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The hypocrisy," argued the liberals, who see it as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Focus in particular Article 220, which confers on the University of al-Azhar advisory role, especially on the conformity of laws with Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disturbing, because "persons called to express are chosen, and they have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Liberals fear even more by the fact that the next president should be less moderate than the existing ones.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For the time being, there was no specific religious consequence.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution remains Egypt by the state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university workers, many of them trained in French schools, "easing fears Alexis Blouet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, agrees with the fact that "there may be differences over the interpretation of Article 220, because it used terms belongs to a religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">In particular, there is a reference to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, but doable].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future, the question may occur, to what extent they are civilian judges have to be able to express. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to the religious site yesterday approved the text is very criticized because of the expanded powers, which grants President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction of the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: The powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the army will be verification of the defence budget to parliament, but the National Defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">In addition, he will be banned in the military court proceedings with civilians, as requested by an association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These associations in connection with the text, which is directed against freedom of its misgivings.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence blasphemy is maintained, and continues to be an insult to the disabled, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially for printing.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no article is not protection of women, highlights the Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is the only positive point of the prohibition on torture, as referred to in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not mentioned in the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president was last night to appear in a televised speech, are scheduled for the afternoon rally.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the heads of state will manifest itself on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The great and powerful" in Moscow: Emigrants to save money on language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the MPs and human rights defenders still debating the law on compulsory language tests, the country has already discovered fraudsters who sell "counterfeit" certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities each year, 13 million foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families back home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The law came into force on 1 December, according to which each migrant workers will be required to pass a test of the knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">The FMS promises, however, that the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The test, however, will be composed not only of the language skills, but also from the Russian history and of the foundations of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will also be asserted to obtain and extension of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where the Russian the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">This law does not apply to people who have successfully managed to reach an exam and get an academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits, the conviction and the protection of the rights of the</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network test sites will work under the auspices of The Institute of the Russian language, of the University of friendship between peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants may consist of the test in all the cities; now it is open in Russia more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to support the introduction of testing support as well as members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, the defenders of human rights often put a question: In the press and what it actually bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the first place - are representatives of migration services - will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the "slave labor."</seg>
<seg id="20">Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Chairman of the Board of Directors FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise in emigrants without a job, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the knowledge of the language - he says with conviction Sebelev - is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with conceding people who help him under the pretext of ensuring "voucher" into the cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, languish for months without food and documents and work for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our migrant workers receive many complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They promise one thing in their homeland, but after the arrival of the lover, confiscate their passports, paid the promised wages," confirms the Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Don't scold!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only don't know the language of the country to which they want to go, but they don't have the experience or even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it's not their fault, but rather an accident: Only a very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that there is a need to be decent to wear, shoes and equipment to the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children grow up in the productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Do you feel humiliated and degraded."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that, with regard to the law on the language tests indicate defenders of human rights on one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have him, so they won't test, nor any other official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, he lives most of the migrant workers, as well as before in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or No admission for unauthorised entry prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the workers' claims that the gain official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the legalization of costs money: From 12 to 16 thousand roubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the false registration can be obtained quickly, and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the Russian police know that we are, in fact, false documents, without authorization, and there are cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - he had shared with reporters about his experience citizen Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of the validity of the law on the tongue, it was found that not only are fake registration papers of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="47">The staff FMS already confiscated several false certificates of completion of language tests.</seg>
<seg id="48">Falsified documents are printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners were not free: Each of the migrants in the hope that they will make it easier for the problem with the tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times higher than the official test: It will be migrant workers, three thousand roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task of the immediate future is to safeguard the system against corruption, so that workers could simply buy documents, in that match, government officials as well as defenders of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="52">Meanwhile, government authorities can promise that foreign workers who handle tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed the course the foundations of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="53">For the visitors, who can't speak Russian, work in the areas in which does not require an active negotiations with the people.</seg>

<seg id="18">The first of them, "the Army or the military path," it means the weapon, which had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"They stole weapons and Russian officers and Kavkazané themselves," says Baraněc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The other type of "black" weapons are weapons stolen criminals for representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that these include theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the institutions involved in criminal proceedings.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines comes from poor countries, such as, for example, Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is the production of weapons, sometimes there are produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which organised their smooth production," explains the former soldier.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">Where's the gun?</seg>
</p>

<seg id="31">The experts, what is the approximate share of the different sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market, "he said."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The specialists dismantled statements of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals aimed at weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers, comes from the military and the executive.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market "due to the officials, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data, which are available to researchers, 17% of the weapons from armed conflicts, in 14% of the cases of the theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The salesman-consultant to one of the shops with weapons, who asked that his name, is convinced that the weapons found in excavations black "archaeologists' long ago nobody is buying - are simply too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Often, he says, sellers rides for new shipments directly into the military warehouses.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Work on the premises, "McDonald's" goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, in America raised a wave of protests against low wages in the company's Wal-Mart hypermarkets and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" Taco Bell, "" Wendy's "and" Kentucky Fried Chicken. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">All this share support the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the modest salaries, which receive rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, the organizers of protests, the aim is to achieve the creation in them in their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, it is this economic sector virtually untouched movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, millions of people and, in some cases, was accompanied by the brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In this day of some workers, the company Wal-Mart, in which the world is working to 2.2 million people, left their workplaces and demonstrated, together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals commercial chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Wal-Mart sold throughout the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries after vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores are on average by 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many workers with low wages in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and variety of goods made from the chain Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of critics, Wal-Mart can afford to sell their goods cheaply partly because few pay their employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic or manual scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators on the "black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies sharply increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Wal-Mart worker receives 9.5 dollars an hour, but it does not correspond to the height of the expenses, staff members say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company 3.2 billion dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company moves Wal-Mart, an increase in wages fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only about 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as customers spend about $12, 39 more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Defenders of Wal-Mart, point out that the protest was held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 o'clock in the evening Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this period, the company Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, the Treasury made in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the Huffington Post, a left-oriented Web site that posts left a total of "less than five" Wal-Mart employees, and that the protest was "the next media sensation," which the unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Vacant Treasury!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York City, where the aim was not trading houses Wal-Mart (those in the progressive city is not very popular, and that is why there are almost), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says that it sells billion servings of, and then you shall be paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York 7.25 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and the average of their rank-and-file workers in New York City 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city no lower wages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well, I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employment in the "McDonald's" can get away with almost a quarter of American teenagers, who are working behind the counter after school on a part-time basis, and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only a few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">At present, in an interview with the "McDonald's workers, who complain that they must live off the money, and some of them even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at McDonald's, "" Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash and cooks in the fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also demanded that fast-food were based in the sphere of trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. laws prohibit the administration to prevent the establishment of trade unions and punish activists of the trade union movement and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other side of the administration rarely makes it easier for life.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the fast-food companies to establish trade unions, however, it is difficult for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Opposition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On this day, he also held noisy protests in a number of other low-priced Manhattan restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action was at noon in the Assembly, "McDonald's" near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, in particular the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's" says that sells billion servings of, and then you shall be paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work! "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators also support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Whether this event happens to be the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is as yet unclear.</seg>

<seg id="1">"In the meantime, the brain to deceive the average"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Among the fans of modern technology virtual reality is a popular topic of the enlarged reality; the last time it means to perceive the world through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference, Google has shown a working model of the news, and in November it was announced that the application for the patent also handed Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that, for the company's scientists are a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the prospect of tampering with virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, the creation of a virtual public space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Tell us, please, what is your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time, we're trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touching the screen with a finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor - it is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because it is a very interesting for all the possibility of using gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What is waiting for us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that the system of Kinect interaction on a physical level, very much interaction is still under way on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The flow of information to improve (the system accepts larger quantities of data), but in the meantime, particularly the flow of output.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change it, we are working on a three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">The computer world is to be admitted into our physical world, make it more realistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in far better form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell with those silly hats virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about the vocal control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It's a popular thing, but does not exaggerate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Of course it cannot be regarded as a panacea - raises the question of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood of their activities and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all the types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, control of the device in public places, we had a project, in which we thought about gestures, but not the sweeping, only about such Tiffany, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gestures nesnímala camera equipment, but bracelet, which would have watched the movements of the bone and muscle.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is great in theory, but it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, that the future of the type of control, such as a gesture of + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- A what?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- How, for example, ask me to give you this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">Can you tell it, and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">I usually just talking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So you want to encourage users to adapt to what may or may not machine at the moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can detect a human reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors, which provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands of modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Today, it is not sufficient depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In the current generation - that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be a good idea to raise 8 megapixels at a speed of 1,000 f / s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it's not just the megapixels itself, but as the nuts and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the current view of the case are all current technology for us - it's trouble designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to bear in mind not only the resolution of the axes X and Y, and Z, too.</seg>
<seg id="43">So speed is also very important, and the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for the gesture.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how much it affects human interaction with the machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, the work was very useful equivalent of such equipment, but I don't need much touching, but I need some frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- A increasing the number of cameras, it is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In the Kinect system are now used three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and receiver reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera - that is, in fact, the current sensor zone.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">A greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse, because it would increase the volume of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presented publicly his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You don't think in terms of day-to-day use of the technology of the enlarged reality with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, walk and constantly keep smatphone raised hands is not very comfortable, but I don't think: The strongest option would be a "portable" form of the enlargement of reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the platform buiding switch from his glasses on the smartphone, the projection display and around.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses - it's a very personal devices, that is their strength (private things you see you), and, at the same time, the widespread weakness - the reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects in conjunction with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that tampering with virtual holographic objects in the air is available only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem, which critics often point: There is no tactile response!</seg>
<seg id="61">Her hands felt nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What your group is preparing a response to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In their lectures often say that the enlarged reality - this is the seventh consecutive a breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that sensation could become the eighth breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the meantime, using one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a kind of background for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excellent!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies, which are really focused on adding the solidity of these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several indicators of the ultrasound beam in the defined point, where the finger, tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on his fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers - also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think that he feels it, what seems to be that he should feel at the moment, when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- It is a good idea, we haven't tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">There is yet another challenge, which will fight for a long time - how to get a man who is physically located in a confined space, to believe that he was walking in an open, virtually infinite space - also working on the concept of cross-country trails (no, such as in clubs), a moving platform, and also big balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, so there is still work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what he was doing work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are out in the early stages.</seg>

<seg id="19">I understand what is my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then a wave of old free unofficial artists and new types of artists I couldn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm friends with artists of the new wave, post-gazoněvskými, who had brought us to the "puškinské 10," and the next wave.</seg>

<seg id="25">There are many: Nome, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought to the project "Ear Van Gogh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Šnur and his friends sang songs under the plywood, dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, among them in the middle of the composer Igor the dowager's, who is now in vogue.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the band began to play live, it became "Leningrad."</seg>

<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed, I ended my peak.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the new times under the old rules is the work of an uncomfortable, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>

<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless categories.</seg>
<seg id="41">I used to be a social, today it is painful and awful.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in klaunech everything collapses, takes a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love, I have a grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, to save the world by totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today, people are under the clothes, focusing on the external drive, not on the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or maybe he cannot be made his hand, and it is necessary to spit in his face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the trick will be deleted change.</seg>

<seg id="60">And the cultural ground 300 people and 10 thousand of them, and the result is less management, money, everything is failing.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have fans, the main thing is that no one is fooled and violates what is ingrained.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I was painting such images, which in one collector hung on the wall, along with Falkem and Larionovem.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="64">Today, people often mistaken concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say: Spiritual culture, the culture of the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture of the consumer, it is elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture of the previous day, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing pictures.</seg>

<seg id="73">In the days of ordinary Tsars, it wasn't in all the czars, perhaps too understand culture, but they understood that there is a need to promote real experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow today are good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">For us in St. Petersburg we've got people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in a corner, because they are needed big experts, who correctly appreciate these experts and state is on the right path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Today's thriving vkusovština.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but they differ by honestly say that not everything we modern art, there are artists who would have to look for other museums.</seg>

<seg id="80">And on our fallow art is doing poorly.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural ground, but for us it is today writers more than readers, it's bad.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are a great many people who are curious, who liked to go to exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">For us it is a layer of weak.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need to get the art has become a fad, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The child's father was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second son was born to a woman-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice, and who also worked in the open space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The boss: Švarcsystému check failed due to the politicians</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has in connection with public procurement supervisors and high-quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing," Kala commenting on the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar conclusions also suggests joint control of the Czech and German controllers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the wrong practice provides access to the so-called "Petr Nečas švarcsystému."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that won't bother his controls - is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be set up, and if something disables, nor Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations," says Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At a meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German party, under which was compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control, which we took off about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply, the European legislation regulates how to address public contracts, followed by the various national legislations and then also the experience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We put all this together, and even if the review is not yet completed, showed us a very interesting differences - generally speaking legislation is with us, "perhaps even stricter and more sophisticated," however, the practice is better in some of the parameters in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Therefore, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still farther and farther away more precise rules, but there is a need to give themselves the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In fact, this project can help you to do, what's in it for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such a joint control could contribute to efforts to stop the precise laws, reduction and improvement of the limits, if it does not have a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy means to obtain the appropriate thing for a reasonable (which does not always the lowest price), in order to avoid enrichment, and possibly criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the fact that we limit orders, that we don't necessarily to achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may be that the system into a "paper" that those who want to find holes in the system, so they will draw a lot easier than if the limit was higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You're talking about domestic problems with passing legislation on public procurement into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar to ours, or is it set up differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">With regard to the authorities, as well as works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, it also has the College, just a little bit in a different way, but, in principle, both offices doing likewise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The powers are similar to a certain extent, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal structure, so has the following the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - in the system differs from our own a little bit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can only control of the federal money, we posed by state resources.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are managed by the county and municipal levels of federal control of the courts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the legislation, so it's easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I would hate it without specific data comparing, in some respects, however, Germany is billed as a model, but I cannot say that it is all the better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is therefore necessary to the fact that they have better supervisors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it has to be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, faced with a wide range of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise it would not be any benefit for them to cooperate with our office, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With regard to domestic legislation, what is your office meant for the amendment of the Act on public procurement, there are no longer any its impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In view of the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we're ex-post controls, there is a need to count with some delays.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We are seeing so far only in the process of preparing future checks - we started our new tool "detection of risks inefficiencies," through which we run almost 14 thousand public procurement contracts, and we've analyzed it - there is, of course, those changes will show, because it changes the limits, the conditions of certain types of competition will be adjusted, and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The approval of this law is more for the benefit of, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem may be that she "tighten the rules" and will not be able to meet them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the previous rules are controlled appraisers provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is therefore worth tighten the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system shall exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, and not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how out of it, then?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us show the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, Mr. Prime Minister, said that the ODS won't bother to check the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be set up, and if something disables, nor Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: "We will change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we will do nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the law on public procurement are relatively strict rules on how what has to be done formally - which is right, in order to protect the public.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic, as the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal deficiencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">Originally, this was probably my idea, then we're all together with our designer John Augusta.</seg>

<seg id="23">We're trying to engage intensively in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.</seg>

<seg id="27">The students Jedličkova Institute regularly running out of teachers and give them in activities that are fun, and are interested in.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the means to the teachers themselves, we're trying to enable them to it in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the construction of the Jedličkova institution in the future there is a separate building, in which we move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert several musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what you choose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to draw up a program that addresses all the generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details you learn to www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are you planning a similar "bombastic action" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May for the first time, we're going to speak at the Prague Spring, so there certainly make an interesting programme is interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I'd like to integrate with the speech in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you have, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, the group, which consists of disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">How they manage logistically and organisationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members in an electric cart, the trucks must travel in the luggage compartment, and, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far it's always without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways to us have been well prepared, I wondered how many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without any problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the výjezdům abroad can compare how the individual differences in bezbariérovosti, access to the public with disabilities, and the like.</seg>
<seg id="46">With what you have not yet met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than for us, we have just witnessed in Russia, in the east, everything is still in its infancy.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague's Moscow a barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric cart in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are obvious, such as that you would prefer to be wheelchair in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there is civic associations, which seeks to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There's a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the improvements and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London, in Madrid is quite common for people with severe learning self in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it's not so much that there would be a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in the social life, in that we have, on the other hand, with The Tap Tap slightly ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect of the public or is one thing, but it was not until the moment when one of us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things will really change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years back what you in 1998 to establish her?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who have an interest in anything.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I'm a musician, playing the saxophone, among other things, so I, together with my colleague founded extracurricular musical ring.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and, over time, we say our anchorman Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But popularity came up in recent years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us when we began to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">Us that the work, which is seen as essentially would not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, moreover, can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Your goal was to go to The Tap Tap so high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt the potential to the fact that we can do something different.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness's crowded things, where imitating one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">In a way, it's logical, everything is taken care of the new, and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">Things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it's only natural.</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with learning disabilities are not suffering from all the things that we have to regret it.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if something can be for people with learning disabilities, so it's not just for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">This success has helped, too, that you are the boss, how many people it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do a good job, we need to be, in many cases, uncompromising and require some discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it is perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that it must spend a lot of time on the road two weeks to go to the test on the preparation and the concerts, so it's enthusiasm quickly leave.</seg>
<seg id="79">But that's the way it works everywhere, in every group, which wants to work and who wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the band The Tap Tap 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were at the beginning of 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">The only Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are open to a group of people come and go, you can't stop it.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and the taste is always the door open</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Incheba Kalfus will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava of form recently, with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week, was adopted at a meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency Poland as a member of the European Space Agency, as the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a fully-fledged member of the ESA 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Flights into space, the Polish enthusiasts since before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which represented 6 December 1933 thoughts of his pioneering work Entry into space.</seg>
<seg id="7">A young engineer (born in 1905) left audiences cold and, after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski said of his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld in 1934 for Entry into space in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), later became a promoter of astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became the world's known promoter of aerospace and his contribution was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It was built in Poland in 1925 trolley rolling stock, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal are not known and are not known, nor the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for the start-up car, or to its application.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about the handcar are known only from dobového press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From 1933 to rocket shells began to deal with the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the writings of materials, it is clear that the research came to the stage prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of German troops research was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, the proposal appeared in the specialist press photovoltaic the interceptors designed by engineer Rohoziński and work out in the following year Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all the projects of military use of the rocket technology gave Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), to coordinate all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years his work put an end to the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish company Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">It is the first mention of the company in the November edition of the year 1954 magazine issues, in which there are four more extensive articles devoted to the astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed the creation of a company, which will deal with the space.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, was already running projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the year, 1956, Poland Astronautics honoured company (PTA) snažia for entry into the International Astronautics Federation (1951), and in the autumn, the PTA became a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">He held the post until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the PTA significantly contributed to the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with dostupem 1800 meters long about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, it was built by an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovské flight tests of two-stage rockets RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 meters long, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another type of development should be able to actual scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should have a ceiling to 14.5 km, and its task was the height of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962, was a further development of the suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Heir to the first rocket-type RM became the Meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a double, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">There have been three types of (Meteor-1A, -lb and -1c), which varied in size space for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor missile-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.07 ounces and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum ceiling for all three types of 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 v Leteckém Institute for the development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The missile Meteor-2 was starting weight of 380 kg, and she was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then they were built in the version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Still, it should be noted Poland's entry into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also in the framework of the programme Intercosmos involved in research space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution has caused to the public a lively discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems, is in permanent conflict between them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause is the principle of free trade and the free movement of unrestrained, private equity, together with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Under the influence of the considerable differences prices work (wage), the price of tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer tries to imports of low-priced goods to compete in the competition, "he stiffs" price competitor with a view to tear down a larger share of the market, and thereby increase its own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a massive scale, it means for most of the entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in the countries where the prices are high in comparison with other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising social expenditure of the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The whole situation is an absolute unwillingness to entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social society damages in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so widely known that there is no need to be specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reckless practices of private capital in individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce social level of their own populations with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments are private capital to its own people, regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected in the amendments to existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to make its own people accepted the price the dictates of private capital, especially in the areas of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's what's going on, on the one hand, economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, both by restricting the rights of employees in the field of employment law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are already a number of years, public ticket food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people is already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay to the breadline.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was published, even in the case of auxiliary staff of the federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures virtually all of the southern states of the EU certainly lead to the same situation, where people are under pressure from the catastrophic decline in social level forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to be preserved for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might someday private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But here it is necessary to ask where it comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it's going to be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or a Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and the media ad nauseam, argues that the state cannot participate in the capital on its own economy, that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state should not interfere in the management of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then there is need to ask whether private equity does not affect, now governed by the policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is a definite answer yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where it is practically everything reprehensible, but nothing criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds awarded the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All the power of the people as a Western-style constitution, but from the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly get into a situation, as her Appiános describes in his book "The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia:" It was a long time ago in full decay and authorities took over the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and using stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any barriers and people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice... "" decent people so that they shall not apply to the office at all, so that was once as a result of this disruption was eight months without consuls.. "." It is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man.. "Appiános thought of Pompeia, but he had become Caesar, who changed to democracy in the self-rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion As in antiquity, the current company is based on reckless preference for their own benefit, regardless of the society's interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply for society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadent elites, without any efforts to reform more profound.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causality of fascist and communist regimes must therefore seek economic systems in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Under the current state of the demise of these systems can be in favour of the type of liberal democracy be regarded as a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">In particular, the disastrous is the fact that the current elite completely ignored in the future can be held casualties, humanitarian and social disaster, which we have witnessed already with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanent.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a lot of reaction.</seg>
<seg id="5">One is standing behind Israel, they argue his right to self-defense, and the Palestinians into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue racism Israeli state, genocide perpetrated by the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel belongs to the role of a terrorist state.</seg>
<seg id="6">I don't want to think about who's in the periodic waves of killing the culprit and the victim, who, after all, the people of Israel today, including self-governing territory were born into the current political situation and the beginning of the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's to offer readers to look behind the curtain, the sight of it, who mainly serves 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is primarily in the history of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every era can be traced some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personality, which completely autonomously governed by their actions and / or whether someone was standing behind the throne, who channeled their actions to advance vytýčenému objectives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have to admit that we live in a time when the world is zkoncentrováno wealth in the hands of a few and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among those astronomically rich families singled out one, which could be considered to head an octopus (if anyone still stands above them I don't know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschieldové.</seg>
<seg id="14">Doesn't say much about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) has already bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop the merger of his name with a highly criminal deeds, stood in the background, and always meant a consolidation of power, wealth, or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the main shares in almost all central banks in the world and against countries, where shares in the Central Bank have or are preparing war (before the attack Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after invading Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime, Russia had been subordinated to the central bank of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who tried to defy the family, died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank Rothschieldově Bank of America, began during the civil war to make his own (government) money, and he was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish FED, was murdered by 1963, a member of the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after what he wanted to sue FED for the start of the Great Depression in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their desire for global power resulted in 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan three world wars a Freemason, the 33rd degree of Albert Pike.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war had the task of removing large monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial estates, in particular the United Kingdom, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere on the 0.5-1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury and do not consume enough resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and end the absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which a group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is the cause of the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (ab chao - order out of chaos.)</seg>
<seg id="24">But these solutions are false and lead to a deterioration of the situation (see establishing FED, in order to avoid crises like the one that caused in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">So after what they managed to murder of imperial heir to the throne R-U Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, destroyed the Czarist Russia run the Bolshevik Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (no longer need to war for the destruction of Czarist Russia), and then there was the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austro.</seg>
<seg id="27">To make it easier to start of the Second World War left bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation by Germany to impose huge war reparations, which created a presumption radicalisation's impoverished masses, and then they just slip the Germans sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering Leader and creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play, and also played a role in the fifth column, sparking a fire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century prompted Rothschieldové establishing Zionist movement, whose one branch to seek the creation of the Jewish state, not preferentially in the historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital of the (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">Already the Balfourova Declaration has created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, to the first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, if Hitler pulled the chain, which it initially held international bankers, or what was in the plan is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp has created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany 2.světovou off to war, the state of Israel was created the third outbreak of war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish nation, like the other victims in the front line of fighting now, together with the Arab or Muslim populations in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country, but also in the international arena (consider just how sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence, when it stood at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There is a need to distinguish between the people of Israel from their leaders, as much as for us, peddled international bankers for the people to choose their own candidates in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, international bankers loyal, a policy that it is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), threatened to escalate into a global conflict, and due to the control of Iran over moving through the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of all the world's oil shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), as well as to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In the light of what is now appears to be the words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis, and the people will agree with a new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">A new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world where the rest of the human population serves comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The world, where each of the newly born individuals implanted in the birth of the chip, which will make it the totally controlled entity.</seg>

<seg id="1">The movie Argo: When is the worst call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 Islamist students occupied the crowd demonstrating the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, which had been the patron saint of the regime for several decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The situation for the US administration offered a positive way - to throw the Shah overboard couldn't afford, since this would jeopardise the trust with allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to reach.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later compounded the fiasco attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered Algerian Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their plight has caused a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran has contributed significantly to the defeat of the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The movie actor Ben Affleck's Argo režírujícího describes one episode of the history of America, which has brought a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before the embassy occupation have fled from her six employees.</seg>
<seg id="12">After the complex business ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them out of Iran, helped the extravagant a cover story - went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country surveyed the location for the filming of sci-fi epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, devised an expert on "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">The legend was credible, said the film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, a production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck film is a strange combination of more genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "right" movie, the story during a piece of foul play - for example, it may be a series of Danny's teammates.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, the mood - on the one hand, the documentation or evidence on the broader sequence from Tehran (in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické photographs of events and the way in which they were the same situation presented in the film, the big differences aren't in it).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there was the scene of the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions -muži in suits dismantled the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleckovi remarkable way to restart a career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vysmívaného actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be a cynical comment.</seg>
<seg id="25">ARGO is his third feature film, after the Czech writers Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is the first Affleck picture, which is not taking place in režisérově home Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A feel for the atmosphere of the place, one of the characteristics that director older films place over the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">He and Affleck, is also reflected in the Argos, where Tehran "plays Canada."</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scene in the movie is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování real events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, who also conveys emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti, which occur when all of a sudden move history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect of Affleck and his colleagues in the scenes contrived (false staff at the Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many events in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that told the story offers a lot of exciting scenes in the film.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully, it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - it's all so elegantly doesn't (a scene in which the imminent crisis at the Tehran airport will call in America and chase down the runway is too far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">But it is a weakness in the Argo ramblings resulting from the need to show too much in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles of Hollywood collaborators was very charming, but their figures would have meant more space and not far from the only thing in the movie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleck film loses a dramatic move, it's a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation of the retro style reminiscent of thrillers of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is hard.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of one sort of living history as well as proof of how exaggerated notions of allpowerful and knowing secret services, but will suffice.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Private property for about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I land about 25 million apartment in ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a couple of million in the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way, Aston Martin, therefore, that it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was a gallant to women and, at the same time, he fought against the wickedness and excesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do you drive an Aston Martin, you have the assets for 60 million, and you don't have the money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give their own money into it.</seg>
<seg id="71">It's not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">It's got into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I bumped into campaign had 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I don't have any sponsors, testifies to the fact that my program might not be so interested.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign of his own.</seg>
<seg id="77">It will cover the cost of the campaign, in fact, what I receive senátorský salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But it would house without a job, for example, I couldn't pay my son English school, which costs 30 grand a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">I just wanted to make money, so nekandiduji anywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So you're going to continue to do so that you can live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Didn't you that these activities utlumíte?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it has nothing to do with the amount of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, I partly out of their activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the travel agent is going to happen in the spring of my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would want me to be a Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I need something to live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much did you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Two hundred to 400 000, which I take away.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if I were the president, I ended my business.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects MVRDV are evidence of the fact that the real adventure are only in my head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Montenegro books - 2 Sides</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"The building seems to be cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, is once again to see something interesting," said Lisette Verhaig, which goes around the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the nearby a large firm, says: "Of course, the house is nice."</seg>
<seg id="4">I do, however, ask what else today, we need the library.</seg>
<seg id="5">They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">In any of these libraries in the old-style now voluntarily nobody goes, yes or no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, in close proximity to the Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, holding a special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">The municipality with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to resolve this silly situation, the decision was made a few years ago, contribute to a general education and build seven painted miniatures fictitious reinforced concrete bridges, which are prominently displayed on the euro banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of educational offensive but not spectacular.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so the city's officials recognized that there is only one possibility, how to become masters of the statistics: We need to have a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas of Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely brave column graphs and the contractor humorous, often even cynical buildings, the thing with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003, with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the Commission still stunned, looking around and shrugged her shoulders, piling fresh Maas their gifts, according to the size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear urban community!"</seg>
<seg id="14">This is my proposal to the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million euros piled.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of the revitalizačního project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and rank-and-filers home with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November was a mountain of books will be honored second place "Best Library of NL 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Small-town gray, which still could offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly Hall, whose white facade you expect more dairies, it is thanks to the richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, above all, is now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of their existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long journey to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: Reading Eldorado under the hatch of the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Means of the Massif mountain ride the elevator, but the real space and reading passion to control the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of all the parties with glass interior is bright and clear, and the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">Urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see the dog park benches, and the boys and girls who play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the shelves with books along the facade, and in the middle is a big dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We built a classic spatial configuration upside down, and the space for the reader, we went up from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly exploited: In the middle of the office, the library, chess club, ecological center and control techniques.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special comfort are black shelves of books, which are lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes railed stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The appearance, structure and the smell of the alien.</seg>
<seg id="33">The unknown building material shaking their heads even avowed architects and engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager for the urban community Spijkenisse, the Standard magazine.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in one fríském farm one day came to a waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as the basis under the roots-millimeter fleece of synthetic material.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and time-efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textiles lasts one or two seasons, and he is ready to blow up the bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library was the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - pressed down on the plate thickness of four inches.</seg>
<seg id="40">By the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Commission on Human Rights) in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps to get to the top.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey will be rewarded in the literary cafe, not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus trees in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly the right humidity in the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Gifts for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I think you wouldn't believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass model project, with regard to the ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heating and cooling the earth's heat.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the books are under glass, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad glued wooden beams, which stands at right angles to the glass facade, serves as a shield, and pick up a large part of the solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">Traditional Chinese medicine, and also a teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as the "long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: Each of the people of the city a few weeks ago was invited to the opening of a book of his personal fund.</seg>
<seg id="55">So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently has 70 000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has been proven.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are crowded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that, thanks to our invitation to a new house now has a population of a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it was just for show.</seg>
<seg id="62">The MVRDV worked in the royal discipline, which, in the jargon shaping identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse said the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">No matter how young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is, in the end, the starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the decision-making process on the adoption of the Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle, Germany in the early week at first suggested that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinians "observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support it, what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I think that will not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - without, of course, was too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was on the establishment of a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">That ultimately put NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and the direction of the policy, which was co-chaired by the US, so to speak, in the direction of the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is all the more difficult, that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are between two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think, in his role as before settling down, but they are on the way to the "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">On foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Specifically, what is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows a readiness in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, the export and its relationships with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other major powers, and that is why Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict, and the vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Firstly, Germany has a large outlets in the Middle East, particularly in countries around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful to discourage the public, but even the elites in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't want to, but not to give too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">In any case, however, it plays an important role in the German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Damage Germany's relations with the US, Germany, in the case of two important decision-making, for example, abstained in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think in Europe and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I don't think that was so dramatic as a breakthrough in the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps even from Germany to gain some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's a signal that they must be considered as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences existed in the wake of America's internal politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has a great understanding of the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But as a result of the political situation cannot, of course, take this position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that the diversity of views are not so big, as they always seem to.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too happy with Netanyahu's policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is not difficult for Germany to harmonise their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and the position of the EU's most important partners on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that's exactly this that makes it difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">For Germans, of course, would have been a little easier if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently happening.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, cannot be part of a wider line and must instead of pushing things forward of their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That's what they were doing with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It was always sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself in the role of a major international player? He wants to take the major role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is a leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany still not used to it, it's still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons for this country is still hard to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role in post-mood.</seg>
<seg id="57">It does not facilitate the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is, in fact, an old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is a much more difficult position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and views, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The US influence in European politics now is constantly falling, the EU, however, this vacuum currently circulating. Who's left?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they don't like it, they're going to do, and it is even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of the brand" in China: When they are Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani's world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is it Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the designation, which is completely officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, enjoys protection, so long as it is nezažalují the real owners of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then, it is not clear whether the law before making purchases.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of the Taylor Wessing, which specializes in the protection rights violations in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week, lands on my desk a new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, the counterfeiters just a few letters, so that they can submit their brand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gucci, for example, Lu-Gucci and Prada instead they register Prada-Kyus.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, they are legally copied and German firms, sporting-goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a file with the Trademark Office records in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14 September 2010, left one Chinese firm to protect brand Ermenegildo Zegna Zegna DF Puma artificial name parazituje at the fashion house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in the copying and infringements of intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities are multistory malls, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeit goods.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there are other Pattlochovy cases on behalf of their clients is opposed to Chinese firms received from the Trademark Office officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," the Associated mark.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word is focused on the "Bang Dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">This meant women who hunt rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is damaging trade, we have to combat it," Pattloch calls.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Mark is diluted, monopoly disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in the precious sample products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company's market research for CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, and the third largest market luxury goods market, which is growing as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="25">Deletion of dubious records in the register brands can be difficult to achieve, however, and that's worth something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells of the cases in which the court rejected the claim, because the name has become a contested after a long period of time, "the reality of the market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When the plaintiff is bad luck, must still pay plagiátorovi, because the damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, he lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, company, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps at the concrete mixture.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company Geely bought Volvo, originally used blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">2.3 grade point CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too much of a small number of staff and premises.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year, allegedly "the work of the emergency situation back to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of unprocessed Statement of Objections dropped by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was concluded 57 000 of these cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still, waiting for the office of 81 500 complaints still pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To do something against it is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is often the case in China, it is an impressive numbers.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the last year has been CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of brands, which is almost a third more than the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's a record, and it means that China maintains a list of new applications for the tenth time behind throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is true even for the number of all existing trade marks - there are a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">It simply means that each log on at an average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Start against the dispute is several times, as shown in the case of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">The group has more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans had achieved that canceled his illegal production imitovaných car parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the forger had secured the rights to the brand Freudenberg continue.</seg>
<seg id="52">We neglected it, because they cannot be protected name in Germany, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management of the company Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">2.3 grade point CTMO then also Munich firm rejected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In two other instances, Freudenberg tale of the law, but the defendant in the case is fighting today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It is necessary to keep a watch</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">It is now a matter pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company had to even look at a hundred years old writings to produce evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg opposing party vainly offered "a high figure the amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"You can see what it means for us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is a risk that the danger from the Far East and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And in the case of the imitators unprotected brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">One Chinese producer in Germany, for example, wanted to log the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of business activities, the group gave up a long time ago, but still managed to avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It is necessary to be very careful," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and the lawyer Pattloch advises German companies to be very cautious in dealing with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international law známková. Foreigners would rather have "everything that is in any way for protection, as well as in China," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama will succumb to the mark, then I guess it will have to pay royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we'll be in the contested segment pushed out of the market.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland, 245 000 orphans after the parents, who had died of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphaned by parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found the group Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attend school of second instance.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in the language of the Zulu "a storyteller," or "one who extols."</seg>
<seg id="21">No one to speak fluent bantuštinou fails in this area, only to sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost ten years, the choir rehearsing songs in this strange soft speech, and sometimes it's also brings back there, which had originally come from: South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">The air distance 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in the Northeast Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which is dependent on the votes of the German choir.</seg>

<seg id="27">In Esitjeni is seen in a small, how sick the whole infikovanosti Swaziland: The highest rate of HIV, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Male circumcision, which reduces the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">This village in the common way for Africa in the spring of 2005, but above all the members of the Imbongi saw many children in the streets, which lacked only parental custody, but everything: Food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without a complete school education in a poor country had no chance.</seg>
<seg id="32">At first, it was still the deployment of private individuals, which for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But a year later, the group was founded "Voices for Africa," which has since taking care of orphans after the parents, who had died of AIDS, almost professionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Which are the most sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial SPI syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral SPI are HIV, the human papillomaviruses, herpes glandis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crabs and scabies belongs to the parasite SPI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to the group of the most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea is found mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted sexual contacts between the men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is between heterosexuálními adults extended relatively few of us, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among adolescent chlamydiové infections are significantly more often than other groups of the population.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the European polls, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, between juveniles frequent human papillomaviruses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all of the sexually transmitted disease must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute, from 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 disease in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 was approximately 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is about one-tenth of less than a year earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What signs point to venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulties in passing urine, discharge, pain in the abdomen and vesicles or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">The danger of the disease may reduce the condoms, but they do not provide 100 percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As part of the sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted infections from impurities and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the event of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examination.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent the consequences later.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, honorářům, which the choir singing throughout Germany, gather some money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"We have a total of about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni sent," říká předsedkyně spolku Annette Lennartz.</seg>
<seg id="63">The money from Germany in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who can impose.</seg>
<seg id="64">Also, to orphaned children found shelter, for example, some of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo, as they say in the language of the Zulu old women are the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them took 14 orphans, give them a roof over my head and taking care of it, so that the children arrived on time every day in their uniforms to school.</seg>
<seg id="67">The children, who no longer have to go to a shelter, Khanyisile, lonely woman, which the group, as well as two of the cooks, the daily cooking for more than 200 of hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">"For Africa," established a school built two chicken coops, and together with the American Health Organisation PSI arranged that many people in the village had HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">It's not granted, even when the disease is in the whole country is so obvious, all is silent about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king of 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"Aids is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">In fact, strange enough in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his expected lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">The state approved a way of life is also to blame for, among other things, that the HIV virus in the past few decades, spread so quickly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But even many migrant workers, who took over the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">At least a little to support cultural exchange, travels the choir Imbongi once every two or three years after South Africa, and he sings songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A busload of white people who sing songs in a speech blacks - such valuation is not only the mood and joy, but also has already sparked tears in many of the wild border troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children, over which the patronage.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although this village hardly can be found on maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than the familiar.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," they say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when you return to Heidelberg, who is here as the crow flies 8733 kilometers to dupajícím singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.</seg>

<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks that broker, are still deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The world's largest telescope was over a period of 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror image of this should be five meters in diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope in the US.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented labour-saving costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Yet his average is about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, the disadvantage of low-priced construction: The telescope is secured hákovadlem in high-rise angle, which is limited his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The Hobby-Eberly telescope angle is fixed in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="62">The particularities of the high-flux.</seg>
<seg id="63">Despite the relatively small diameter mirror the biggest mirror dalekohledům around the world.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists are based on the fact that it is the ice at the South Pole of Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger circling the planet far closer to the North Pole.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: Most stinking fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Five million people living in Norway is enjoying one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe, but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret of success of the country could be associated with the local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a few overripe cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put them in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave it there for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">You get a sense of smell paralyzing the smell of rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I'm in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is snow, a beautiful view - and the omnipresent stench hangs in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is salted fermented trout in the water for up to a year - depends on how much you want to fish stank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As the dark and cold, beginning with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet at the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, nejpodmanivějšímu appetite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You can eat it raw and then zapijete glass shall be," says Havard Halvarsen, the local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk" the general, who is responsible for the course of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people eat small cubes fish with large quantities of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people have aquavit rather than the rakfisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink may trump the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few pieces of try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, who had been on a long journey by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when the poverty in Norway, and because there was no fridge, fish in the autumn dipped into airtight barrels of water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, and ate - senses dulled alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation ago thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave his country and look for work, and most of them have emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of the immigrants are attracting a large amount of work, with high wages and extensive care system.</seg>
<seg id="22">The people of Sweden, an old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is viewed as something important, an indispensable, even though a stinking, part of the past.</seg>
<seg id="24">One of the more expensive dishes on the market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is often lacking in the global news - and it seems that most people like it that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The name Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremists, who in the last year, he shot 77 men, women and children, people still refer to with distaste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, the shooting is called the "event of 22 July."</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians may be hard to believe that in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For the current wealth of Norway's growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the beginning of the 1970s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says the administration of plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and startling blue eyes is the prototype for the Nordic welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as you say, thoughtful people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, as well as the English of the majority of the people here, it is absolutely fine.</seg>
<seg id="34">Don't... Grandstand, we don't like flamboyance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of most of the money from this sector invested in a special fund intended for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial meltdown threw money, which didn't, the Norwegians had at its purse strings tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And the rakfisk to eat," he adds with a laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I've had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">The elk burger is certainly something else, and it's nice juicy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening's smelly fish here again.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, in which I live, is one of the many places where the rakfisk for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most demanding fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have a connection with a live television transmission, in which he is the host with a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like singing Eurovision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What you score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here's our scoring, Håvard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Applause and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="48">The man fell out of his chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe the fumes of all the fish.</seg>

<seg id="2">As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges facing, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the city, which is clogged with even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, the aim was to prevent dojíždějícím in order to get to work, but to prevent protesters from gaining access to the Parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, the new President Enrique Pena Nieto Mexico received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Face a daunting task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico, at the time of the outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has an estimated 60 000 lives for six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has a big commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction of violence," the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he shook hands with the American president, president of Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are different views on the new leader, as well as in his old homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Direct man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember the good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The citizens he attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can now get into town after one of the new motorways, which let Pena Nieto to build the highway are a huge improvement from leaky and rugged roads, which have been here before.</seg>
<seg id="17">His name also hangs on the wall of a modern sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the theme of climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the MP for party president Pena Nieta, institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular we hope in an interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy, which our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After continuous 81 years in power, the PRI party ousted Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Member Olvera admits that after 12 years out of the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the intra-party from Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the opposition refuses to comment characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It's a very straightforward man, very biased with excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other hand, this is not the impression that has many people of his former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad, cannot be contrast with the cobbled streets Valle del Bravo clearer.</seg>
<seg id="27">Tucked beneath the traffic overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the region are also persistent and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year, the army was called in to help with the management of the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially poignant is violence against women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Only in the last two years have been deserted places beside a huge waste dumps littered the body dozens of the murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">At a time when he was governor of Pena Nieto, was murdered in the State of Mexico, more than 1 000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the best case, Pena Nieta critics say that in his time in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">And, in the worst case, accusing his leadership of the closing of the eyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In the concrete house, typical of a run-down neighborhood, shows me a photograph of his late daughter, Mariana Islands Irinea Buendia Luna and crying.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of the Marian committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived at her house, so it looked as if someone had washed her body," says Mrs. Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs of the strikes, and has already begun rigor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">As her mother tells the story, Marian looking down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which is a single word: "Justice."</seg>
<seg id="40">However, this is how the family says, exactly what they had been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">State authorities were to me, as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want you to simply accept what they say, and silent.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But it can't be right, when there were many errors and omissions," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The sash, president of Pena Nieto received on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last six years have been tens of thousands of families affected by violent crime in Mexico and the new president promised during his tenure in office will be his priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that it will be the same as president, as he was a governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member PRI Olvera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad fears the most.</seg>

<seg id="41">The defense argued that the plans that Manning admits guilt in the lower crime and that he will fight against the other accusations, because they are too extreme.</seg>

<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are out there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them hard times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the last trip to the capital, Mexico, I barely pushed through the crowd, and I came into the room for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Arrows pointing to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and all my life I was called "Mexican."</seg>
<seg id="9">It is an ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston as "the Irish," and my friends in New York referred to themselves as "the Italians."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, I ended up in the "Mexican American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides interview in that language.</seg>
<seg id="15">I don't have, however, vocabulary of native speakers, and I can't get rid of an American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I was thinking about the moment when this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited in the White House, President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were the usual business, which, when the leaders of the two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the same probability that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pena Nieto has promised that it will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though did not provide any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never thought to the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of weapons replace half of Mexico's territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">A minute later, United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the kids Montezumy walks on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet it is the real challenge for Mexico relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">There's a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country, which offers possibilities, and others don't.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, it is that at some point our family tree was the person, maybe a parent or grandparent, which in Mexico was denied the opportunity and he had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than it would seem, this person fit the profile - dark skin, a weak education, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not against Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though we are living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico's.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but it is not our loyalty.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is against the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Beyond that, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">He sees us as a reminder humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico have failed, he would have never left him.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we now foundation imprisoned for silk curtain, with the good life in the United States, but still lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and in his childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that there is a tension between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because the Mexicans more understand who they are, and Mexican-Americans resent it.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if it is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And, at the same time, many Mexican Americans, which I know feel as part of either.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to the Mexican group Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Get the best of both countries, but you don't have one.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico on us is viewed as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And we considered the Mexicans in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And to complicate relations, they want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, to reunite with the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to Mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as "ambassadors" and represented the Mexican interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and pressure on political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Well.</seg>
<seg id="56">It's not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It's fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States acted with Mexico in front of one and a half century ago, so it must accept the fact that some of the Mexican-Americans still feel uncomfortable for the manner in which it was treated with their family members in significantly more of the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we Mexicans, "" more than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles, the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas would still could be the basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, has been amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis and, for the first time fell rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even when it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in his ancient conflict, all around them, change the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has changed the old calculus and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe it means that the fight will be even bloodier than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither won nor lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems that at the present time, there is not much reason for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, the fight from this week to strengthen hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which rules in Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, though Gaza suffered defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the poorest global and the most populous parts of the world, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, Hamas leaders may very well decide that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Islamists throughout the Arab world have greater influence, so that Hamas has acquired a powerful and wealthy friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, revived regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, joined on the side of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering people call from Hamas, the Islamic crescent moon circles around the north of Israel from Lebanon, where the ruling party militia Hezbollah through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on Israel's southern flank changed the rise of Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous Arab country, and the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, not Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a future Hamas diplomacy may appear as a player, who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will reach the opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms it was Hamas back into the box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli anti-missile system Iron dome proved their worth, and many of the Hamas rockets had been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis can sleep better - for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, America is as solid as always, many European countries also blaming Hamas from the opening of the latest round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And, most importantly - Israel prosper, in particular, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protecting Jewish settlements, which are still growing, despite its illegality in front of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections held on 22 January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you really have ruled on the West Bank, it would be neodpalovali rockets, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if we stick to the wall and hit them with sticks his head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Maybe hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even though the Islamists, who gain power in Egypt and other countries have Israel too in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Israeli defense spending is higher than the expenditure of all four of its Arab neighbours together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, it is a good sign, and it may be the start of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis also would have to look at the situation from a long-term perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates the denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day in the areas Israel occupied explode - as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Currently repression weaken democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attacks against Gaza every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is that reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: Two states, Israel claims the territory due to security.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar must work to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state was more than an immediate offer virtual sovereignty to the United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its share of about how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In his first term neglect the presentation of its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="2">The heaps of green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are illustrated warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Entry into force of the Australian laws on the packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors brands to replace general olive green boxes of ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body and the views of children and infants cases as a result of their parents' smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are required from Saturday the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the same small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the strictest in the world on the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.</seg>
<seg id="7">He relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26 years, is a 99 percent chance that they never smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even in very young children, you can see that he understood the message, which is trying to sell their tobacco companies together with their product," says Tanya Plibersek Federal Minister for Health and cites studies that have shown, for example, that the children in the log with the idea to be a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argued that the law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to a cheaper and more abundant.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thanks to this legislation is a serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia would bring a lot more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Another says that the laws have increased their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, said that the demand on cigarette packages of silicone used to cover the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal on the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that the company Zico has sold almost 6 000 kusů wholesale dealers and expects the new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's a good deal for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a possible snag experts argue the popularity of social media at the demographic groups, to which the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and requiring that most vendors hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and Internet sites, however, cannot restrict foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you're marketing worker in the tobacco industry, and there is only this small space for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space insurmountable place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the evaluation of the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average John."</seg>
<seg id="23">We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and put the work and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focused on how to deal with the new regulations, rather than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the assault of the new rules - the country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly.</seg>
<seg id="26">The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek says that the government has led talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country to introduce a mandatory warning pictures in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The stricter laws are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia are resisting.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pictures do not have any effect on me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Just think you pull out a cigarette and a box of your back," says Victor El Hage when buying boxes of photographs of tumor in his mouth.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world of constant connection is not so bad, being bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical trouble, and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I won't lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on child development is increasingly coming up with praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that, for us and our children) is a good thing sometimes bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And given the fact that most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have a chance to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We should therefore support?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I'll come back to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, as well as many of the people I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, occurring with the arrival of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as he says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canada in Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (history) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, has a long history of boredom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, dating from the first century A.D.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, "said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After watching the research literature and brought to the target group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I've been able to."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom is different from apathy by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that there is apathy in the urge to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that at the heart of the boredom is a "distortion of the process associated with a bad mood and feeling of rushing past time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can remind a lot of depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, when people tend to see the problem as the environment, or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes, we think that's boring, then, when we only have trouble concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article from the magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard loud and non-television program in the next room, others heard it so low that he barely noticed, while a third group didn't hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard the television program quietly, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble with concentration, but they weren't sure why, and attributed the problem boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult task, it can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as the search is wrong on the factory line, distracting music can help with that, to be bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, we now know that the twisting and drawing, which is often regarded as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that children who are allowed to stir more to learn and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all sometimes boredom experienced - my flight delays, the speaker, especially a lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals have a greater chance of bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To help with the measurement of boredom scientists in the 1980s had developed "Living for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale covers issues such as: "Many of the things that I have to do, and it's monotonous," and "I have so many interests, that I don't have the time to do it all."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using these scales of scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, "said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular, as regards the need to have more, and various external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times daily contact with almost 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of the adolescents said that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents reported that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.</seg>
<seg id="44">He said, however, that he knows that "adolescence is the time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: "Boring is good for you?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo an absurd physical risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, "said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is the way of the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain doesn't know there's always the best thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and use the energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you watch television, do you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child is bored and you give his iPad, he won't be bored, but learn how to entertain itself or separately to drive, "said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"And this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another," said the professor.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learn only how to entertain itself, but will give greater self-control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we shouldn't be too critical to her.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our aim should be to feel more comfortable when we are out of the reach of the business and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We are accusing it of the needs of the more boring, boring, but it is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's what people are looking for, in fact, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is hard to find ways to entertain, when the noise."</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A 19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at higher vocational school and football player from the southeast Colorado, is facing charges of crimes as something that will soon be in the entire state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and pipe, which he used to her smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco said that one September day rode with a couple of friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - petty offences, which is fine for each $100 - and he was set the date of the court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the weeks after the vote on the Colorado legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use hundreds of smaller drug cases, the answer depends on-the-spot, rather than on the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington, which has approved similar measures, canceled.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police department to stop blaming adult at the age of 21 years of age and older for possession of small quantities, which will be legally permitted after the entry into force of the law in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in conservative districts Colorado have declared that they will continue with the existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western hills votes on preventing the opening of new state licensed stores, with the marijuana in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The gossip and regulators in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="14">And they're looking for instructions on how to set up the licensing system for the cultivation, production, distribution and sale of - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, it is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana for medical use, and now a recreational.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol of the State of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or the system cannot do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent, according to which we could drive," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, the so-called I-502, shall take effect December 6, which also left the annual vacuum, during which there will be no state licensing system, but legal possession of, yes.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance state directive relating to the "appropriate" approach to the licensed marijuana, with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, playground or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"There will be more difficult to place a licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, the recently-based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will no longer be prosecuted for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each citizen aged 21 years old, and that the police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws regulating medical marijuana growers, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck stricter look.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offense, which was crimes at a time when they occurred," Mr. Buck said in his statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction has been complicated in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected joint initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, has already grown blame for possession of small quantities.</seg>
<seg id="30">The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports the decision, but also decided to reject all pending cases of possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I don't think I'm losing my time continuing in law enforcement, as long as it does not change," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing the recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is for the district prosecutors' cultural barrier, "said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, and the local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They spent so much of his life, the prosecution of people still cannot accept that it is legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states, which have a small quantity of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the cusp of becoming the national test cases for the legalization of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and state authorities are planning new frontier for legalised the sale and, at the same time, anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates the legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice complies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and those who use it, which have attracted attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in the operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While protidrogoví agents may not be out the door, to pick up a small bag with the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing state regulated business with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, "said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the administration of President Obama's drug policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several Colorado cities waiting for federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the election day some local governments have approved moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before he will be able to open any trade.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week the city of Montrose west of the State has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone we license, and then we will have a federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We're looking at it, for what the municipality voted, compared to what passed state.</seg>
<seg id="47">There is really a lot of questions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave from Oxford, because I'm a conservative."</seg>
<seg id="2">Their views are being attacked by today's college students.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't remember that I ever dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">As my father, my older brother, studied at the university, which I thought that it is the world's leading knowledge-based, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And while I'm at the end of the 1980s, in the twentieth century within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed her bags and slammed into the first scandal of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke down and wept.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up, because I had objections to the students in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from the battered cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less comical.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran away, because I have been subject to a systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I've been persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of enlightenment, it was perceived as a bigot, so barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a high-ranking adviser Margaret Thatcher and a supporter of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You can ask why it until now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just because recent reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right of center is suffering from a similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of students demanding the same protection equal rights to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the Association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, argues that because of his political views "are often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and they made clear that they were not welcome."</seg>
<seg id="19">The creation of a position in the university's Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can communicate freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation didn't help, nor the BBC Two documentary recently named Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Stories: Young, intelligent and right-wing student politics, which he described as odd conservatives and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">The agenda was introduced to graduate Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA Conservative Association at Oxford University), which drove Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a walking stick with a silver head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities conservative students say that he is with them due to the introduction of higher tuition fees treated as a "scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="23">A 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the University of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské), he told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.</seg>
<seg id="24">People believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without meeting with us at all. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Said a student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, which stands for the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is "bad," while a 19-year-old elected the president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the JCR members access to the people on the right side of the centre of the worsening.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During his first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.</seg>
<seg id="28">I got in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hatred against the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.</seg>
<seg id="30">A year earlier University voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">From the atmosphere, the Stalinists shivered concern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">During the first few days in the opening week, when the new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which was supposed to come.</seg>
<seg id="33">I found that not only professors tacitly approving conservative pupils, but with a taste even participate in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The paneled auditorium was diverted policy mining strikes, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="35">My first lecture about the text of the 18th-century French translation into English, and that's what happened, I wasn't ready.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "the first paragraph, please."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was hard enough.</seg>
<seg id="38">Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like dessert dough, it was a lot of bilious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" He asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students snickered.</seg>
<seg id="41">Tears came into my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in his spare time, so if you're not too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Heartbroken, I returned to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">At a dinner in school, I sat alone, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a sophomore named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said softly.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is so.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is a target.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the conservative freshmen pretending that they are labouristi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later in the local pub I tried to pretend to be.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted on the fact that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick has proved unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You're daughter fascist pig."</seg>
<seg id="55">You are infected.</seg>
<seg id="56">The other students notovali with him.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was sick, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How conservatives love?" Asked one.</seg>
<seg id="59">Hitting each other, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt so, how they feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">Could I ever to lead a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">I would have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years in front of me like purgatory ignorance and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who had resided at my school.</seg>
<seg id="66">Sadr was not only for the fact that he is conservative, but also for the fact that he is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">Almost there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place for his parochialism and pettiness and for his shift to Marxist-deterministickému view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, took the place of a professor at the University of Bilkentské in Turkish Ankara.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You won't be happy here," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to commute from Oxford to his parents' house in London, seeking refuge in his partisan metropolitan friends and family.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">He couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s were accepted by all political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it's the best place in the world," said pathetically.</seg>
<seg id="76">It didn't, not in the city of dreamlike mood.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends have always been perfect ways.</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes troubled.</seg>
<seg id="79">Try it again.</seg>
<seg id="80">I'm sure it's just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart if you left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week in the course of the teaching, when the next history professor in utter seriousness, "he said that I was an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Even though I was inside the blushing with shame, I said to my parents "brainwashed" and called it "the old fools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The relief was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">My father hammered the nail in the coffin of my career.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time, wrote two columns in the newspaper each week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I crouched inside and after five minutes of my pursuers.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I've never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me usmrkaným wimp.</seg>
<seg id="94">But there was no 18letá girl or boy in education should not be subject to such intimidation and virulence.</seg>
<seg id="95">Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, of which not only 14 conservative prime ministers, but also to this day, hiding behind undeserved reputation as the place with the equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">The toughest job in the world: The sulphur in the area of the volcano Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Four of the euro in jeopardy in the area of the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, when 70 kilos of sulphur down the steep stone paths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners, who earn their living from Kawah Ijen conquest of sulphur from the volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of that must accompany each day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases from the interior of the Earth, and in contact with the air passes into a solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After all the big blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carried on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it is only 250 meters, but exhausted bearers takes over 40 minutes before the tortoise pace up when it rains, because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected his steps to ensure that they haven't and nezřítili into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as happened one French turistce, which collapsed years ago from the rocks Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which yields</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When they are at the top, making her way past the tourists who took them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, and tired is hard to the basket to the weight of the mining company ranked slightly below, at an altitude of 1850 metres.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in a volcano benefit since 1960, and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, entertaining fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Because normally carries 70 kilos, earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, which usually carried out three trips a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way he takes three hours, and at the end of it is gone, but he can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems insignificant amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what would be made on the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The daily wage miners here is very high, for example, the collection of coffee to pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for a fortnight's two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, of serious reason, which is as convincing as sulfur in Indonesia: "I'm married with a young girl from Bali, a Hindu, and I took her to Java, to convert to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes has a toxic gas</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years of Kawah Ijen Anto three times daily risking his life in a volcano, whose sulfur had already begun to collect their toll, although his face is protected by a special mask and goggles.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, breathing, coughing and irritated eyes has a toxic gas, which escapes from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price we have to pay for it, in order to achieve his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'll work for another two years, because I want to open up trade or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This charming and intelligent young man in fate could be tourist guide, the waiter or the clerk at the hotel, and instead of doing the work.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers, and every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur in the night and continues to build up its distinctive yellow and blue glow in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto into the crater and illuminates the way a small lamp, which is mounted on his helmet, and he bought her for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters carrying on their shoulders the sulfur from the bottom of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has high incomes, sulphur production because of the cost savings nezmechanizovala, nor does not provide porters working on his own and with such efforts, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, do not receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) bonus for photography, which, together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) collected the natural park from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," argues Madrusin, a burly 42-year old porter, who works in Kawah Ijen in three decades, from the time when he left the school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that will work, "as long as you can," because he needed the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulfur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and miners in thick fumes from the volcano is based, the miners are saying that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... it is, however, clear from their frequent respiratory problems, into arthritis pain on his shoulders, knees and wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, in his 53 years may have only 50 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his colleagues in the volcano vydolují 15 tons of sulphur, which then three trucks transporting steep path between the trees to the warehouse in Tamansari far 18 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life," says Unainik and opens his mouth wide, which is missing a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">The oldest of his five sons, a 30-year-old, also makes mining sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but chronic poverty remains one of the toughest in the world from generation to generation - craft, which are engaged in human mules in Kawah Iljen.</seg>

<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The one who takes it very lightly, the Government of Singapore.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">Government package for marriage and family provides up to 15 000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and allocate financial benefits.</seg>

<seg id="20">Singapore is a wealthy Southeast Asian city-state with advanced technology, also known konzervatizmem of its leaders and strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the structure of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a peace, recovery in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why Singapurci have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Mingová, Director of marriage and the family of the National Agency for the population, says that it is because of "better education," and "a wide range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it's not only the marriage and the family," he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to delay marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">While in the framework of the immigration policy, there were efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a precaution against the decline in the number of inhabitants, it has caused resentment among the local population.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the decline in fertility rates are well-known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, expenses in health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to oppose many small home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, began to affect trade in real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain urban areas.</seg>

<seg id="36">These apartments have 46 square meters and had great success in marketability.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is a fear that these apartments can promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build a large family houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the developers EL Developers, claiming that their "shoe box" sold far more quickly than larger houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"They are more popular, so that they will sell for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, they are much better for our cash flow. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">He admits, however, that the new rules are clearer rules developers, who were previously limited, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too stressed out</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although the new rules could be directed to an increase in the birth of the nation, the conversation Singapurci working in the financial district in the centre of the city suggests that they will not have a big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people," says the young officer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"The others to have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">But for me, it is important to rely on their own time and money, "says another, about a 20-year-old young man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women cite career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons, which prevents them from having children.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">Key issues</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porrasová, a teacher of English and a graduate of the Education and teaching, has it that children and adolescents in social networks correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">States that: "The Internet was created as a means to search for information, but when the social network, has changed the rules of the game."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová notes that the academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of Yale University and the author digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The digital natives are children and young people who were born in the time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We're digital immigrants, who is we have to learn, and yet they still learning, "he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that it is a complicated issue, "because it is asking to see what it is appropriate to publish and distribute, to say and what not, on the contrary, in an age when it is not yet ripe."</seg>
<seg id="46">Also, to be reasonable, at a time when what he wants is to be the most popular, have thousands of friends and tried not to think about the consequences, "he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the Specialist is the most effective way of children and adolescents to show what's privacy, asking questions, which makes them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">In addition, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: There are things that you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: Would you like it if someone published a picture of how you published a pal's?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the other published about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When are you calling the person in the pictures of the celebrations, the person you asked for permission?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more: All they need to know what you're doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The other point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It's the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"A man outside the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles and the same would be on social networks," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Supervision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, college professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">"If understand every guile, have a good basis for it to play with children talked about the consequences that establishing an account on the Internet may have.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, in terms of age, or of what is allowed to share or to publish, "he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children traditional rule "don't talk to strangers."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe's integration</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, today announced that the establishment of a common citizenship is an objective, in which the "South America, in this case, you really must learn from Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential Jihoamerické Union Nations (Unasur) summit in Lima, said in the state TV that the Europeans' killed in World War II, "and in other conflicts," but now they are practically one country. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, defended the project the creation of a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the organisation Unasur support.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the South American country, which is already underway between the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary area, which we want to return to the past," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Ecuador's president, expressed, inter alia, that agrees with the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that the impact will be reduced Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Those who are in the lead, never to do anything, and we all Latino men, on the other hand, sign.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is financed by the United States, "he said, referring to the political asylum from Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">President Correa has confirmed that he has no regrets about this decision, because it betrayed its principles and respect for his "deep democratic values and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said that at the time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, criticized the Swedish justice, who asked him to be examined on Swedish territory because of an alleged sexual offence, "the Swedish legislation allows you to carry out the examination videokonferenčním conversation, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk that Assange will result in a deterioration of physical and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I haven't talked to him since he's in the embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a small lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorean head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"But there is a risk that his physical and psychological condition deteriorates, because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.</seg>
<seg id="15">That would be affected, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June still earlier Ecuadorian embassy in London, on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and pointed out that the London talks in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of the WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"We're not negotiating on human rights, in this case, we don't use such a word, but still continued talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because the lawyer Assangeův Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in the various European instances, "said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">He said that "if the United Kingdom will pass tomorrow, everything will come to an end."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Mr Assange to Sweden still earlier Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the legislation without a problem and, as has been done in other cases, tomorrow will be accompanied by the end of this problem. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took advantage of the situation to be presented as a defender of freedom of the press, and make it clear that he does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, which undermine freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">The biggest enemies of a free press, we're not mean-spirited and vicious politicians, but bad news in the service of the profit, coercion and blackmail, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">From this point of view, expressed joy over the fact that no such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic countries and even bourgeoisie Ecuador," and said that, if re-elected, "will continue in the changes in the right way and in the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">President Correa also supported the decision to maintain a veto expressed by Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur, at least until the next elections, and argued that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and pučismus wrapped in the legality," because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy Paraguayan democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In addition, Ecuador's president, said that is "entirely appropriate" the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time after the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment the judgment is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's a problem between the South American and-friendly countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome will walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is necessary to assess the wide, to have been overcome, and there was a chance to go forward. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He also expressed the hope in the settlement of the dispute on the maritime border in the same court, which deals with Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international resort, where the two countries commit to accept the judgment, no matter how hard it will be."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In connection with the possibility that he would run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to run for a third mandate, he said, that sees this option "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, goes from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"I personally never cared much, but it was so unfair situations, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only correct political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">My political movement believed that it is I who guarantees the likely victory, so we have to accept this responsibility, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term, and then I would leave from politics.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, it's the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="37">I've decided, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez has gone to the planned routine treatment, and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not a relapse in the health of the president, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The victims of AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of his test: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was like lightning struck me," says the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "mitigate" a little bit, but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy's family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his own illness on their shoulders and began to inform, and that with such commitment, to celebrate the 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of the earliest Unit HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after a battle with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, with him, the director of the clinic, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) said good-bye, "because he was cut."</seg>
<seg id="9">Then AIDS have been synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive and live with this syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is, however, a lot of people who don't know about his illness, and when the virus caused the destruction of the organism and vysílil immune system, and then become victims of random infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since the world AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases of, "is a great success, that the life expectancy of the patient, who in a timely and appropriate manner with the treatment, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and a specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that, since 2008, AIDS is not a judgment of death, but that the survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system, patients who are diagnosed with the disease, the better are those who use drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells, up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, it means that the one who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with the treatment of live without problems up to 75 years old," the doctor said in an interview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To highlight that progress, it is appropriate to remind Mexicans, the average life expectancy today is 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico dropped the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics on 60 percent of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the state of Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and in May, 187. However, since 2005, is a universal access to antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why continue to the people of the consequences of the disease die?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - "It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's the way I see it, this is happening for us in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of supplies of medicines. The problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds: "Nine out of ten patients comes when an Associated infection. The only thing to do, we could have more impact on the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier and, therefore, it is to be on a large scale to offer tests for the detection of the disease all persons who ask for them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincides with the specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who had come to a private lab tests to do just that he did his friend, and despite his low age of AIDS and also suffered from cancer, Kaposi s sarcoma, which is one of the most common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and don't want to know anything else.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I have to die, you'd better be vyřádím three times a week," they say, but it's not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. "</seg>
<seg id="28">His parents still knows only that he suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I live a normal life like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I am an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to himself and to the other person, "lists Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge, to share their experience with the daily Milenio Jalisco today, in the framework of the World AIDS day motivated their testimony to those who are worried.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Whatever they do tests. If risk, then let him know as soon as possible, and if they are HIV-positive, it is better, and if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, will be held accountable."</seg>
<seg id="32">This message summarizes the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">It's a big gap between the programmes for health and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who discovers information regarding the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest gaps in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, which is dedicated to this task, "is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What do you want?" Is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school staff advisers, pharmacies and medical staff, which adolescents want to avoid, the reporter says.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested this inefficient distribution of condoms are not just behind counters, but a hundred is located in dávkovačích on public restrooms, in places where young people often.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It's not promoting promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It's not to pay them a beer and a motel," as the governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district.</seg>
<seg id="42">Takovásexualita isn't the best way is to make condoms to those who had sex life, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judgment by the Court of Appeal in the United States, which does not recognise debt restructuring the company Grupo Vitro bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for any national enterprise with offices in a neighboring country, and the problem of solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems, then, that corporate restructuring procedures, which allow Mexican laws in the country lanes and stars, despite international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Approval of the judgment issued by 15 June last year, the judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas, in practice, the Mexican company without a defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the ruling opens the Mexican producers of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First, it should be noted that while the judge this case argues that the creditors have to follow Insolvency Act of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth district, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Firstly, it would suggest a lack of international cooperation in cases of insolvency multinational companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, the model law was created for the purpose of the United Nations for the reunification of international trade law, the arbitrator determines the organisation of the American Law Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the ruling stipulates that without a vote of branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, it would not be achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the possibility of the Mexican laws allow.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which it was adopted this scheme.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is a half-dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose transfer debts guaranteed the Federal Institute of Technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, it is true that even after the deduction of branches of the creditors - who stood against the company Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. funds "vultures," such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - achieved majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The court of appeal, this figure does not take into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another point of view, accuses the company Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the serious economic crisis, which hit the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals, in order to assess the full participation, with the participation of the five judges, as originally voted only three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">If he fails here, will require a revision of the appeal process more instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case is serious, that the court failed to document sent to the Mexican Government as amicus curiae, in which the company Vitro procedure is described in detail in the bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company had opted to the agreements signed by both countries that confronted the law with Chapter 15 insolvency law of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Navícse points out that the country's U.N. principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantees equality for debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>
