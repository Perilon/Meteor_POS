<seg id="1">The Republican Party against Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify its policy necessary to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">brennanovo centre, a scam called the myth that electoral fraud is less frequent than the number of people who die in the US after a lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, after all, for the last 10 years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures undermine some of America's democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada have responsibility for the federal elections of individual states in the US.</seg>
<seg id="8">and in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 has been the new laws, which make it difficult to process the elections or the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only 180 proposals submitted for 2011, the law limiting the right in 41 States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">new election laws require voters to submit a photo ID and proof of American state citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, zneplatňují right to be listed on the list of voters on the day of elections and odnímají electoral law citizens in its criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">before the elections in 2006 did not require the electorate documents půkazu photo ID no US state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first state to introduce this request was Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">constitutionality indianského law confirmed the US Supreme Court in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican authorities spěchaly with the expansion of the procedure and to other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">The proposals in the last two years have such laws in 34 States to force voters to give identity cards with photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, unlike quebeku American citizens do not have universal identity card, such as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, owns 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged to vote, no passport photo ID issued by the government by their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, there is no such an identity card about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions will disproportionately affect mainly young, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years so it does not have the required photo ID card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that is not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">the students, who are known as voters in their turn to democratic candidates in several States are not entitled to use their identity card with the photos of their school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same States allow Members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote more Republican candidates, card issued these clubs used in the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, require no state in election proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such request by Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">from 2011, about 12 States laws which sets out to show the voters that they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic community.</seg>
<seg id="31">It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislativci support laws in eight states that the minutes of the day of elections in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, the right of individuals and groups to provide aid to limit the voters who want to write.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during general elections in 2004 helped campaign for the minutes of the electorate to zaregistrování around 10 million people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken in 2009 but has caused a decline in the process of adding new voters in 2010 to 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican lawmakers, in the other five states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general elections in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of the electorate who voted for in advance, although afroamerických was only 13% of voters in that state.</seg>
<seg id="39">for Hispanics, it was the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They were just 11% of all voters, but 24% of people who voted in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, whites who, 76% of all voters, only 46% of the electorate who voted for in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">against the pass laws that limit the registration of voters, of course, very strongly up the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">democratic governors blocked its veto several draft laws.</seg>
<seg id="44">In order to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">Some of them managed to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, laws requiring photo identification, only 16 of the 34 States.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly introduced rules, however, is undeniably difficult in 2012, the performance of the voting rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">democratic critics talk mainly about bias approved laws and they are seen as the obvious attempt to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report brennanova centre of 2011 shows that states where these laws were passed, are 171 of the 270 electoral college votes necessary for victory in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain already: this new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures undermine some of America's democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">The detection of prostate cancer: an investigation or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">the dog to sometimes wrong results, which have been negative or even misimplemented positive, leading to unnecessary medical zákrokům.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of this has increased the hesitancy of men, who are already reluctant to investigate at all to go.</seg>
<seg id="4">to be investigated or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked for the opinion of two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">in the studies carried out in the US has shown high levels of contamination between testovanými groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the noted the different mortality among patients who are running the investigation, and those on them did not go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also demonstrated after 12letém distance, that those who do not go to the investigation are about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastáz.</seg>
<seg id="9">I recommend the investigation from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The men are also at greater risk of the African-American origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision when the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers, such species, which are inert.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, it is essential that the right to explain the patient's level of the dangers of his kind of cancer, it can offer alternatives neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and focus more on active surveillance of the disease in these cases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men, who was diagnosed with cancer cure, as their kind of cancer is not aggressive and threatens the life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will offer them more of the active supervision and in the case of progrese offering the treatment of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more often and with greater accuracy set out the criteria, which help in deciding which type of treated and which do not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet so I recommend to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is important to interview with the doctor and the investigation to determine whether it is appropriate to take or not.</seg>

<seg id="21">disease prevention</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risks of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all healthy eating and sufficiently hýbali, up to 30% of cases of cancer could be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If we all stop smoking, this figure rose to at least 50%," underscores the André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian society for cancer research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that around 10% of cancer caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some percentage of also remains totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">for the Canadian society for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers has fallen.</seg>
<seg id="29">cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also the risk factor for several others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"even today is in quebeku 1.5 million smokers," kroutí head spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">encouraging figure: 10 years after kuřák stop smoking, the risk of cancer death falls by half.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="34">weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">tělnatost and obesity are under SCC another risk factor for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancers of the esophagus, slinivky and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommended to reduce the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is appropriate to avoid uzenin, for that is the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat uzením, drying or solením can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent times, the various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1">higgsův boson examined</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery higgsova bosonu justified concern raised last summer.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then there is the last particle, which predicts the existence of the standard model - our best or the "least bad" explanation of nature and behavior of matter - but that has not been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">between physics, however, is not yet 100% certainty that higgsův boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">doubts about the fact that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to higgsovu bosonu as předpovězen standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">new data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto, but rather the lack of it, all the data in order to have an absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Suppose, however, that this is a higgsův boson, since the risk of error seems small, and look at what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world is undeniably a law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise, ublížíte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although it is částicová physics very strange world, it also shows that it is a similar law: off exclusionary principle, under which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "kvantovém status" - the "state of" roughly speaking, some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">further divided fyzikové particles in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony obediently follow off principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">and at the other end of the range bosony, podlí anarchists, who are nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that may well be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the equipment (by the way, absolutely wonderful), which is the particle adventure in Berkeley Labs: mesony unnoticed, which we leave here," and "power of particles, which is a natural forces and with which is higgsův boson probably somehow spřízněn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It must be said, however, that these bosony are so exotická that, as it can be to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If this article read, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual banalitou: fotonu, or "particle of light," which is "a proponent of" electromagnetic forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the particles with electric nábojem quicker or change its direction," Cancel "the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like oblázek thrown into a lake.</seg>
<seg id="19">from this "intervention" will create electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave of nothing more than fotonem - and thus one of the bosonů, "by force."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is also with higgsovým bosonem, with the only difference that "vyrušit" needs to be the other higgsovo field that this boson discovered.</seg>
<seg id="22">This higgsovo field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; to his excitaci is to be achieved very high energy values, as with the frozen pond levels already zčeří just a great rock.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is to be used as a huge urychlovač part as urychlovač in laboratory CERN - great hadronový urychlovač friendly ties is a circle with district 27 km! - in order to develop the energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field once again suited to clarify the relationship between higgsem and matter.</seg>
<seg id="25">with the electromagnetic field do not, in fact, not all particles, all materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do so, but not other - a piece of paper, for example, will never be from himself to ledničce.</seg>
<seg id="27">and the same is true, that with higgsovým field do not all particles: those that do have a matter, while others (such as foton, let us look at it) do not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">and Mrs nováková asks what all of these studies are what "will bring us?"</seg>
<seg id="29">From the point of view of science is a confirmation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to bend of any discrepancy between observation and forecasts SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many physicists, literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and close some of the loopholes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is to say that the model still has huge problems, there are no clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which account for around 80% of space (again ouha!).</seg>
<seg id="32">facilities but CERN has such contradictions there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">response</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The response of the research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs novákových can find it difficult to predict, a mistake, however, would have to believe that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">hleďte: right at the beginning of the 1960s not průkopníci laser in low-level language features laboratories no revolution, will have their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">assumed scientific use, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and he created the first permanent laser beam (the rays were pulzní) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially regarded as a "toy to laborky."</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">and, in addition, can the result of all the instruments that surround research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle a little light scanner in 1969 during their work aimed at optiku.</seg>
<seg id="41">This scanner, although Boyle initially at all so neplánoval, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that activity around lhc are bound to change lives, but does that mean that you really never know...</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% kanaďanů simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is designed to ease the suffering, when ill will come to the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or pečovatelském House.</seg>
<seg id="47">and a number of organisations, such as the home victor-gadbois and society for domestic palliative treatment Grand Montréal specialize more or less exclusively on care by onkologickým patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in quebeku leads to many doctors specializujících on palliative care is the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr balfour mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe, in which show their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to doktorky words martelové is quebecký health system powerful enough to ensure all people access to quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, recently experienced pacientku, which spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain without anyone has taken the necessary steps to her there.</seg>
<seg id="52">fears that patients do not ask about the killing on the grounds that they are not getting appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">and at the same time that many onkologů takes care of their patients until the last moments of regardless of the dismal prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="54">hopes for the survival of Hélène richardové were already quite minimal, when left difficult chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I their onkoložce told that I am ending with treatment, responded that regrets that I'm no longer sure fight, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">and, I said, that is the end of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">doktorka martelová estimates that 90% of people who wish to die, thanks to its ošetřujícím doctors, for their wishes nevyplnili when they team palliative píče alleviate pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it is important to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to elsie monereauové, Director of palliative care in society for domestic palliative care Grand Montréal, 8% of patients from the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="61">at the very end of life often doctors use palliative tranquilizers that patient uspí until the moment of demise, whether nárazově or whether it is tranquilizers were permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot pretend that this part of the suffering we do not see.</seg>
<seg id="63">the patient, which nezbavíme pain, will have more access to paliativním sedativům.</seg>
<seg id="64">ill, which is not given the sedative, always say the same thing: 'I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," this means more of "I want you to think of the pain."</seg>

<seg id="27">I had a number of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As you look at the first part of the season psg?</seg>
<seg id="30">At first the League are Lyon, took the position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we remain in the Lee.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from psg expect too?</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as if psg in all relied on performance zlatana ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that says that there is a "dependence on zlatanovi."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to the 15 000 computers involved in the network has already been been registered about 200 000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">about 1,000 Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">course bitcoinu first reached a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, today it is on the border of ten dollars (overview of courses is put on the page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products is not an imposing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) on this fact is in its report on the virtual finances, published in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money," "competing" and "the dollar and the euro equivalent of normal money."</seg>
<seg id="11">bitcoin differ from other kinds of virtual money that is used for the procedure as "credits" in the video game, which one gets a game or that you can buy (and sometimes even back to).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">social network Facebook has also made a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Every month, but the central authority controls and processes the communication.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of bitcoinu are all units network depozitáři current account books, supervisors, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As this network operates?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction between two users is, in fact, between the two electronic addresses by email.</seg>
<seg id="17">The user can choose a different address for each payment, which provides anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">a set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with the system with the key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the legitimacy of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file is also possible to ensure that vyměněné bitcoiny existed in the public paper current accounts, which is distributed across the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key point is this new transactions in the minutes to this book.</seg>

<seg id="23">This is the stage rozřezání file; that is, to the transformation of the huge file on shorter and unique digital footprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "take" this new transaction and add to that number, then a whole "rozsekají."</seg>

<seg id="25">The aim is to find a figure that provides specific mark (a lot of cipher's at the beginning).</seg>

<seg id="27">transactions then nezničitelně display connected to a print of a chain of all other transactions; any regulations would have to change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the user would like to fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly for us (in 10 minutes), the network is only one of the two transactions - the second will be removed, because each of them has a different impression.</seg>
<seg id="29">the computer, which will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.</seg>

<seg id="35">"využitá crack is not the Protocol," assures Pierre noizat, who founded paymium, society for the payment of real money, which uses the network bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also controls the money laundering opportunities with this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this problem is true for cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">major players, such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like platform Wordpress blogs is taking.</seg>
<seg id="40">Adi Shamir and dorit Ron from weizmannova constitution in Israel recently analyzed the current accounts, and showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů neobíhá.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November started "huge discounts."</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was vyměněno thirty thousand dollars' rejoices Jon holmquist, who works for coinabul dealing with converting bitcoinů in gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre noizat, who is also the author of educational books on this money, has a lot of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">his system, paytunia is equivalent credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu paying mobilem, but uses the system bitcoin for verification of the transactions, which are cheaper as a result.</seg>
<seg id="45">The also manages its identity and can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easily sets for traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">We need to address, which can be telephone "ofotografovat and identify," clarifies Pierre noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>

<seg id="49">"before bitcoin prevails, it will be a moment, but 2013 could be decisive," predicts.</seg>

<seg id="1">The difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Mohammed mursí ventured into another game of poker.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the constitution, which it temporarily gives unlimited powers, decided to play vabank.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday announced regardless of all the others, that the constituent assembly tomorrow to approve the final text.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago by the head of state this Assembly of a further two months to complete the work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For almost two years used Egypt provisional text, which was very much filled in, which undermines the constitutional stability of the country and leads to the rumours.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only further strengthen the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the point of view of the President of the opposition, in its "autocratic deliriu" to "violates its word" and "tramples on the right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">his supporters, however, assures that it is a means to quickly zatočit with constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transitional process.</seg>
<seg id="10">a referendum should be held in two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short time slot, which the Brotherhood will withdraw from the text of the Egyptians to article by article.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also a way for the President to achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while protests have rocked the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview with us weekly magazine time, Muhammad mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.</seg>
<seg id="14">especially because this hastily organised the vote puts the people of Egypt before ultimatum: "either approve my text, or I leave unlimited powers," which would otherwise should end after the adoption of a new constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this particular air yesterday 85 Members of this constitutional assembly approved the text with a large majority of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="16">most liberals was missing in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, not long before the Constitution bouchli doors with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities their step napodobili.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum was yesterday morning hastily added 11 people from the náhradníků.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted in unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes that day točil around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee were of the view that hours in the meeting rooms are not properly seřízeny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The general subject, Article 2, remains consistent with the version of the 1971 constitution, and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">the Salafi parties, which is one of the fundamental requirements of the introduction of Islamic law, hoped that the "deadline" will replace the term 'rules', which would allow stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">for Islamists, the fact that this article has been corrected, a sign of their good will and respect for the other component parts of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"hypocrisy," argue the Liberals, who see it as just a figure of speech.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them the Islamisation of the constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">focusing mainly on Article 220, giving the university al-azhar advisory role, especially for the control of compliance with Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the professionals to Egypt Sophie pommierové is worrying, because "people povolané to express are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see this in the beginnings of the theocracy."</seg>
<seg id="32">further fueling concerns of liberals, the fact that the university's next president should be less moderate than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"so far, it has no specific religious consequence.</seg>
<seg id="34">with this constitution Egypt remains aware of the framework of a civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, not ulamové, but University workers, many of whom she majored in French schools," tempered by concerns Alexis blouet, which is the work of a constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">agree, however, that "there can be differences about the interpretation of Article 220, because it used dates is part of the vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science pozn. red.].</seg>
<seg id="38">and in the future, it may be the question of the extent to which they are competent civil judges to be able to express."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday the agreed text is in addition to the religious site very criticised because of the expanded powers that the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction compared with the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another controversial place: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the army will verify the defence budget to Parliament, but the national defence Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Then they will not be banned management with civilians in military courts, requested by the Association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The association is in the context of the text, which is directed by them against freedom of their doubts.</seg>
<seg id="45">the crime of blasphemy is maintained and an insult to remains banned, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, especially for newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="46">No rule, not about protecting women, highlights the heba morayefová from Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">as it is the only positive item mentioned in Article 36 of the ban on torture.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word was not mentioned in the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President had yesterday evening to speak in a televised speech, rallies are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the heads of state will demonstrate on Saturday.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year, 13 million foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, turkménie.</seg>
<seg id="5">their sole aim is to earn enough money to support families at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The law came into force on 1 December, under which everyone will be working migrant obliged to test of knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yet this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, the housing stock and domestic economy, lifestyle and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">FMS promises, however, that time will be the appropriate tests mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the tests will be composed not only of linguistic knowledge, but also from the Russian history and of the foundations of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">will also be the door to gain knowledge of the language and the extension of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where the official language is Russian.</seg>
<seg id="12">This law is not even people who have successfully achieved atestace and get academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>

<seg id="15">migrants can consist of tests in all cities; it is open in Russia more than 160 such centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to support the introduction of testing support and members of the State Duma and the federal migration service (FMS).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, the defenders of human rights could very much to ask a question in the press: and what it actually bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change to know the language for the Russians and the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">and above all, to the migration services, to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of "slave labour."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Board President FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be launched before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">the only system organised the recruitment of foreign workers to solve the problems of 90%.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise with immigrants without jobs, without education, who do not know the language and have medical assessment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">without the knowledge of the language - says with conviction sebelev - is the future migrant sentenced to the terrible conflicts with people who will help him under the pretext of "voucher" irregular, close hostels in which will he and dozens of others, such as himself, but for months without food and documents and work their fingers for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Many of the complaints we receive from our migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their home country they promise one, but after the arrival of podvedou, zabaví them passports, nevyplácejí promised wages," confirms the main of the labour migration management Ms tolib\ xC5 aripov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">nenadávejte!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, recognise that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to, but do not have the experience or even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not their fault, as a disaster: very little, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that they need to be fairly obléci, obout and equip to school.</seg>
<seg id="31">as children are in productive age, must receive the work at the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">without the knowledge of the language is difficult to admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"you feel the humiliation and méněcenní."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that, in view of the law on the language tests show human rights defenders to one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">testing will be implemented only those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If they have not, and will not have to pass exams or get no further official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers live as before in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or unauthorized entry prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the arriving workers claim that to get official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all those linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">The legalization in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">the Russian police employees know that we are in fact false documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">"require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists on their experience of the Tajikistan citizen umed chuškadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"come on, do lakomý buy malbu"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the language law found that false are not only evidence of migrants to register.</seg>
<seg id="47">FMS staff have seized several false certificates of passing the language tests.</seg>
<seg id="48">falsified documents are printed on ordinary color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners were not free: each of the migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with absolvováním tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is two and a half times higher than the amount from the official test: the three thousand rubles will become migrant workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task of the near future is to ensure the system from the corruption that workers cannot simply buy the papers, government officials and human rights activists agree on that.</seg>
<seg id="52">government authorities may yet promise foreign workers who failed tests they needed time to have completed the course the foundations of the Russian language.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In America in recent days there has been a wave of protests against low wages in hypermarkets society Walmart in restaurants and popular fast food chains such as McDonald's," "Burger King," "taco bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky fried chicken."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a ninth, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This whole share support trade unions and many left-wing social organisations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the modest everywhere salaries, which are ordinary workers in walmartu and in the systems of fast food, is the aim of the organizers of the protests to create in them in their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment this economic sector is virtually intact odborářským movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week after a díkůvzdání, in the so-called "black Friday," when America hit orgy of cheap fire sales, a million people and, in some cases, is accompanied by a rvačkami.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some workers society Walmart, in which around the world working on 2.2 million people have left their workplace and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals chains whose goods is for the people of the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">WalMart sold all around the world, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many low-wage workers in stores Walmart buys only for themselves at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and range of goods made from the chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of critics can Walmart to sell goods cheaply partly because few pay their staff.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic wheelchairs or small scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators on "black Friday," called for an increase in salaries and they complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the companies have risen sharply from 30 to $100 per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical worker WalMart receives $9.5 per hour, but it is not in the level of spending, say employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Walmart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on the salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company WalMart shifts wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, will each visit to the state by only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">for the year as customers spend about 12,39 dollars more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Defenders of society WalMart point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"black Friday" in stores the company insisted on Thursday from 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight The next day, and during that time the company WalMart sell about 5,000 items of goods per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, the Treasury made in the "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">company representative Dan fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning aimed website huffington post that jobs have left a total of "less than five" employees walmartu, and that the protest was full of "other media sensation," organised by the trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"vacant Treasury!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">protests continued this week in New York, where their aim not trade houses Walmart (those in the pokrokovém city are not very popular, and that is why we are almost), but the "McDonald's" and other types of restaurant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says that sells billions of, and then you or not with sick leave and not you properly for your serious work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York 7,25 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">fastfoodové restaurant this pay rise gradually, but only slightly, and on average, their ordinary workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this drahém city no one has lower wages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well I do not understand how you can be in New York for that money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">employment in the "McDonald's" through almost a quarter of American teenagers who work for standing there after school part-time and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people see in that its main source of livelihood or plans to remain there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">At the moment, they constantly in an interview with the workers "McDonald's" who complain that the money must live and sometimes even to feed their children from them.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, hangs on the Wall Street Journal forum comment, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday for "mcdonalda" 40th street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash register and all businesses fast food began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice the minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">also called for trade unions to be based in the realm of fast food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American laws forbid the administration to defend the establishment of trade unions and to punish the activists of the trade union movement bullying and redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="42">from the other side of them, rarely making life.</seg>
<seg id="43">introduce businesses fast food trade unions, however, is difficult for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is extremely high employee turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">opposition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On this day, noisy protests were held in many other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action was at the Assembly in "mcdonalda" near Times Square, where there were few local democratic politicians, particularly member of the city council jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's" says that sells billions of, and then you or not with sick leave and not you properly for your serious work. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators have seen the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the town of bill de blasio, who said that "we must come together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve fair compensation for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">as described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of America's sphere of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though far from all of them were employees of fast food in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Whether this event will be the spark that zažehne fire mass movement, is still unclear.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"so far are brain mislead on average"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The reality is a popular topic among fans of the modern technology of virtual reality; it means seeing the world in recent times, particularly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the early years at its annual conference showed Google working model of this news and in November, it was announced that the patent application by Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">from an interview with a group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft\ xC5 aramem izadim shows that the glasses for this company scientists are already a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">attracts is the prospect of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Please tell us aware of the framework of the deals with your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">We are dealing with interakcemi man machine, but at the same time, we are trying to move beyond this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">humanity has yet at the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, most sometimes affects screen finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want vyhlížet in 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, konzola Xbox and sensors kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without scanning kinect, because for all the management is very interesting gestural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- what is still ahead of us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- despite the fact that the system kinect extended interaction on the physical level, there is still a lot of interaction on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The flow of information to improve the system, greater amounts of data, but the flow has not particularly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, we are working on really trojrozměrných display systems based on the various technologies including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is important to allow computer world in our physical world, do it more real.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the room around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to add to the real world, the virtual objects in much better form.</seg>
<seg id="18">and in the first place - to hell with those silly helmami virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about hlasovém control?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is a popular thing, but nepřeceňuje?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- surely it cannot be seen as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, not because we always want to inform others in our neighborhood about their activities and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, we had a project for the control equipment in public places in which we think about gesture politics, but not on rozmáchlých only on such skoupých, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">gestures while nesnímala camera equipment, but náramkem, to monitor the movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is great, but in theory it can reduce the size of náramkových watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, that the future is a mixed type of control, for example, a + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- and how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How, I ask, for example, to give you this can limonády?</seg>
<seg id="29">You tell it and at the same time ukážete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually just simply talking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- oh, that will be very difficult to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- it is not necessary, but it is the convergence.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more precisely to the man.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors that provide a good depth of distinction, that is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you have to talk about their work with sensors Xbox kinect, what are your demands on modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Today is not sufficient distinction, the depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- in fact, the current generation - that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to speed of 1000 F/8 megapixels.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not just about the megapixely, but as a nut and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the views of all current technologies are inadequate for us - přidělává work designérům algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we need to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and y axes, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">So, the speed is very important, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">human movement is a dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second, frankly, are a bit of a little, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen betishes of our laboratory in redmondu did dotykový scanner with nastavitelným processing delays of 1 to 100 Ms, and the current sériově produced sensors are closer to the other ($60-100 Ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how much this affects human interaction with the machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, the work would be very useful equivalent of such facilities, but I do not need so much dotyků, but I need some extra images per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- and increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- in the system kinect are now used three "cameras," one of which is in fact range transmitter and the second person - odraženého signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">and a third camera - that is, in fact, a scanner visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">more cameras could potentially solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">or worsen it, because it increased the necessary volume of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create flexible analog system kinect, pohrát the zakřivením Hochzeitslocation cameras and see how it will help in determining the 3D location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">If I recall correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) has not presented publicly their glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that, when it comes to the daily use of technology the reality with special glasses, this is one of the nejslibnějších platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Of course - to keep the hold smatphone in zdvižených hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be "transferable" form of reality, when it would be possible on the basis of the platform clouds switch at any time of the glasses on the smartphone, screen display, and round and round.</seg>
<seg id="58">glasses - this is a very personal equipment, that is their strength (private things you can see only you), and, at the same time, the weakness - the reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual buildings at the same time with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holografickými objects in the air is available not only Tony starkovi in "iron man," but also normal smrtelníkovi.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one issue on which critics often point: there is no dotyková response.</seg>
<seg id="61">hand feels nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- in their přednáškách often say that the reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the tactile vjemů could well become the eighth breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">So far, the use of one of the interesting tricks - using the other hand as a kind of paper for display.</seg>
<seg id="66">in an excellent manner, drive down!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding hmatatelnosti these "lines in the air" - for example, the country several směrových ultrasonic X-rays ranging in defined point, where the finger is a tactile feel, but it is still very weak - as if you foukal on bříška fingerprints.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also a wrist strap on the wrist, which affects nerve conclusion in the fingers - also promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- have you tried to deceive the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">to think that feel what appears to be that he should feel at the moment when they see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- it is a good idea, we have not yet nezkoušeli.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is another challenge that will fight for a long time - how to make a man who is physically located in very stísněném area, to believe that is open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not in clubs such as), moving platforms and also huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes, it is still work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things in the very beginning.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">\ xC5 head nkú: control švarcsystému failed because of politicians</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has good supervisors in relation to public procurement and the quality of the legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview for aktuálně.cz says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"the law will never be perfect, but it must be the right applications - this is what we believe is missing," comments on the current situation kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar conclusions also suggests the control of Czech and German controllers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practice says approach Peter nečase to so-called "švarcsystému."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS is not entrepreneurs bother his controls - so it is prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"the law must be somehow set after all, and if anything will ban, so did the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to go to monitor and enforce the obligations," notes kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The audit committee in the House, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German party, in which the was porovnávána procurement legislation in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was specifically?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The parallel control that we have launched about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply, that the legislation is how to deal with public procurement, followed by the national legislation and then also the practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have all of this together, and even if the control is not yet closed, we have very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps "stricter and better for us," however, the practice is better in some parameters in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is, therefore, that it is not enough to create still further and further more precise rules, but must be given to the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What can help you in this project, what does this mean for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is the kind of control could contribute to the effort to stop spending on specifying the laws, reducing and improvement of limits when it has a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">economy means to obtain appropriate thing for a reasonable (which is not always the lowest price) to rule out enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, by reducing the limit orders, that we should not necessarily achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may be that the system zahltí such a "paper" that those who want to find holes in the system, so they will benefit from this much more easily than if the limit is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about domestic problems with other words transferring public procurement legislation into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar our nkú, or is it set in?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the authorities, as nkú there is bundesrechnungshof, which is organised as we also has the College, is only slightly differently, but essentially both authorities doing likewise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The powers are also similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the Court of Auditors and at the level of the Länder - that is the system a bit different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">brh federal money with us can only control of state resources.</seg>
<seg id="26">public funds, which are managed by us and the communities, there is the control of the level of federal courts of auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the legislation, so it is easier than our?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general I would without concrete data to the situation, however, in some ways, Germany is described as a model, but certainly not to say that it is all the better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is so even by the supervisors have better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but, again, I do not like such a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it has to be said that the countries which we consider to be a model, are faced with a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise it has no benefit for them to work together with our office, no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As for the domestic legislation that, for your office meant the amendment to the law on public procurement, are already evident in its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the duration of the amendment is relatively short, so we still not in control of events.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we do control ex post, is the need to count on a delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We see this not only in the process of preparing the future controls - nastartovali we have our new tool "risk detection inefficiencies," through which we prohnali almost 14 thousand public procurement, and we analyzed - there is the change of course will show, because the conditions will change the limits to amend certain types of the selection process and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The adoption of this law, do you see more for benefits, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it is the case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem here may be that she "rewrite the rules" and it will not be possible to honour them.</seg>
<seg id="40">for the previous rules are controlled people committed to the provider (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the Regional Council) to each of the public procurement law is a violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">So is the cost of the law in this way; eventually?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want it to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal misconduct that does not affect the decision making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">and how out of this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us show, where the road is not.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs will not bother the controls of the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what it means?</seg>
<seg id="48">\ xC5 varcsystém is prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be somehow set after all, and if anything will ban, so did the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to go to monitor and enforce the requirement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">can say: "We will change the law and we allow this," but cannot say that we are going to do anything like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">in the public procurement law are quite strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented - which is the right to protect public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic when those with the best offer is out of the question for the formal shortcomings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right applications - this is what we believe is missing.</seg>

<seg id="6">It can be closer to the readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The national benefiční action, which we have been planning for two years.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally it was about my idea, then we all dream up, along with our stage artist honzou augustou.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, that we want to build enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want, along with the public to wonder what the state of one of this world will be passed on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of mayského calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original klíčků against the end of the world whose buying on www.e-tap.cz us people can also support.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are also working with the other members of the cultural scene, given that we hold a lot of benefičních events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are working intensively involved in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">in what will be the proceeds of concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The equipment bezbariérového education centre studeo, already the sixth year of operations with civic associations tap in jedličkově constitution.</seg>
<seg id="27">for school students jedličkova regularly are running out of instructors and address them in the activities of the constitution, which is entertaining and are interested in.</seg>
<seg id="28">the students themselves do not have the means to be taken for lecturers ourselves, we are trying to allow them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In regards the construction of jedličkova constitution in the future there will be a separate building with this project in which we transfer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">on each koncertě floor several musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what you picked?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to build a program that appeals to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will speak Chinaski support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, the tap tap Marián bango and George dry.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details you learn to www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">you are planning a similar "bombastické action 'in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring, so here we certainly an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year we would also like to zahráli in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, as we would like it has in the US, with speeches in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you have spoken out, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The tap tap is, however, the group, which is made up of disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">As these trips zvládáte logistically and organisationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as terrible as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five Members on the electrical wheelchair, its cars to travel in zavazadlovém area, also, of course, faced with vláčíme large quantities of cargo and beden instruments...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, has always performed without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways to us were well prepared, I often wondered up.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to výjezdům abroad can compare how different the individual in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just seen in Russia in the East, that is all still in full beginning.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Prague Moscow is very bariérová, here it is still unusual for one to an electrical wheelchair he instituted in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is not even a self-evident, as that to be wheelchair users should do you prefer in the lift.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are also civil unions, which is trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">and what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are plenty of things in which we are still behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that better and improving the situation is always dependent on the aspirations of the people involved.</seg>
<seg id="54">in London and Madrid is perfectly normal that people with a heavy hendikepem of moving to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not the usual power that there would be a lot of people with disabilities a more active part in social life, here we are, with the tap tap a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be leading athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, and things really begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The band of tap tap is very popular at the moment to come back a couple of years back what you in 1998 led to establish it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I came as vychovatel to jedličkova constitution, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to address.</seg>
<seg id="60">and as I myself muzikant, hraji including saxofon and I, along with my colleague iniciator zájmový music circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">So over time we, as is our moderator láďa angelovič, a little out of hand (Laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But the popularity has come up in recent years, am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that help us when we started to connect the familiar singers and also to work actively to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have seen that work, which is, in fact, as would not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford good lecturers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">was your goal to go with the tap tap this high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt the potential, that we can do something different.</seg>
<seg id="68">showbusiness is crowded things where one have imitations of the security.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is the logical way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">The things that are unique, there is very little, but I venture to say that tap tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, is, of course, sorry, this is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the sympathy is totally unnecessary, because people with hendikepem no suffering all abandoned beings, which we regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means to do so.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that when something in people with hendikepem, so this is not the only for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">to this success, that you have a strict boss, as you said that many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do good work, we need to be tough on many issues and require a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think this is completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion and head in the clouds, and when they discover that must twice a week to go to the test, be on the product and spend a lot of time on your concerts, it is the enthusiasm quickly leave.</seg>
<seg id="79">This is the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who want to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the band of tap tap 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were on its beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">only one láďa angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We open group, people come and go, this cannot be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="84">who has the will and the taste is always open the door for us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be the day before the expected at the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and kosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">last week was at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency made Poland as the 20th Member of the European Space Agency, as other countries from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA, on 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and in the other years contributed to a number of projects agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">flights into space to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always meet with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let me remind you, for example, a lecture A.\ xC5 ternfelda in Warsaw astronomical observatory, which was the idea of their pioneering work on 6 December 1933 entry into kosmonautiky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) to cool listener and after years of\ xC5 ternfeld vzpomínal that only Dr John gadomski wondered about his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">\ xC5 ternfeld in 1934, for entry into the kosmonautiky in France price Robert esnault-pelterieho and André Louis hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">vzpomenutý doctor John gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and kosmonautiky.</seg>
<seg id="10">in the Polish journals published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on these vědním disciplínám.</seg>
<seg id="11">gadomski has become world famous promoter of kosmonautiky and his contribution has been acknowledged by the fact that one of the kráterů on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">already in 1925 was built in Poland kolejová trolley, which should be a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is known and not known or the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear whether the missile should be used for the start-up drezíny or to its zabrzdění.</seg>
<seg id="15">information about the peak are known only from dobového press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">since 1933 the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">research for komórka techniki uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. mieczyslawem wolfkem and Prof. gustawem mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">from dochovaných materials, it is clear that research has now reached the stage of prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of German troops research was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">in 1937, in the professional press suggested fotoelektrické purchasing missiles by engineer rohoziński and have come to work in the coming year rakieta - torpeda powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza author leliwy-krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all the projects of military use rocket technology to temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which all work coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of his work put an end to the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">further work on the space after the war in the Polish press is thanks to the work of the Polish astronautické society (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time is the reference to society in the November edition of the magazine in 1954 problemy, in which there are four broader articles on the subject of astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from Prof. M. subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that will deal with kosmonautikou.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, already rozbíhaly projects artificial satellites and it was clear that the space research is promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the year, 1956, the Polish astronautická society (PTA) snažia to join the international astronautické Federation (founded 1951) and already in the autumn, PTA has become a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">and in the next year, the first President of PTA take zarankiewicz (cafés - 1959) has become a Vice-President of the international astronautické Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">This function held until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">since 1956, PTA significantly contributed to the development of very successful weather rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which has conducted scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of rm-1 was completed in 1957, the first start, 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">rocket with dostupem 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">later was built an enhanced version of rm-1a and started in the summer of 1959 in bledovské desert flight tests dvoustupňové rockets rm-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">the missile has been long 1.4 standards and its weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">further development of the real scientific work - should be able to have the rocket rm-34 should have dostup to 14.5 km and its task was monitoring výškového wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, further development was suspended in 1962.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">the successor to the first missiles of RM has become rocket meteor-1 developed from 1962 to them.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was designed as a dvoustupňová, its overall length was 510 cm and the weight was 32,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">were developed three types of (marked meteor-1a, -1b and -1c) that was different sizes area for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">In raketě meteor-1a was available space on the volume of 0.4 liter of meteor-1b of 0,34 litres of meteor-1c of 0,62 litres of.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum dostup for all three types of the 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The situation between flights and 1968 was in the aviation Institute of development rockets meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">rocket meteor-2 had the weight of 380 kg and was able to bring useful burden weighing 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">then versions were built meteor-2h and meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is important to mention Poland's entry into cosparu (Committee for space research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee cospar two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also under the interkosmos involved in space research area to Soviet artificial družicích and in 1978, the Polish pilot miroslaw hermaszewski became after Vladimir remkovi second interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">repeal of the law on public work is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the constitutional court of law on public work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution triggered a lively debate in public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">liberal oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, is in the permanent conflict between us.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause is the principle of free trade and free of unrestrained movement of private capital, along with unrestrained financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">due to significant price differences work, wages) There are price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept is the need to understand the situation, when producers are trying to import cheap goods to compete in the competition by "podrazí" price competitor with an aim to shoulder a greater share of the market and thus increase their profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">on a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or they buy cheaply, or zaniknout.výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared with other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">because private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for it vyprodukovanou unemployment, are necessarily the social costs of the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation underscores the absolute reluctance by businesses to pay taxes and replace it with economic and social a social damage done in pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so widely known that there is no need to include specific statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">the unscrupulous practices of private capital different economies are in a situation where national governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the welfare of its people in order to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments, private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is particularly in changes of the law.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is economically to force their own population adopted a diktat of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and limiting the rights of workers in the area of employment rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between the rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In srn exist for a number of years public výdejny food for the poor, who cannot make a living from their work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the increasing competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that properly employed people receive a wage that they must pay to the state subsistence.</seg>
<seg id="23">This scandal was published, and in the case of the auxiliary staff Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">austerity measures in all the southern states inevitably lead to the same situation when people are under pressure from the catastrophic decline in social standards forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or živořit for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might again come the private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is a need to hear but where it comes from?</seg>
<seg id="26">If this is from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, brazilec or Turk, marokánec or Egyptian or African would still work for a fraction of the salaries.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies across Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theories and media ad nauseam argue that the state cannot participate in the capital on its own economy, that the command economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital for insisting on the position that the state must not managing interventions to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then we need to ask whether private equity do not affect, it is now policy and the state in their own egoistickém sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is a clear answer that yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of virtually powerful and ubiquitous in all States lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in terms of corruption in the area of providing those benefits, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In srn situation is such that the State Department for lack of money commissioning a draft law private legal firms, which are frequently in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These amendments are then agreed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">all the power in this way does not come from people as they claim the constitution of the Western type, but financially strong groups preferujících own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that as the liberal democracy is now quickly get into the situation, as it describes appiános in their work in the crisis of the Roman Republic caesara and pompeia: "the state has been long in the decay and authorities obsazovaly violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">for bribes, illegal obtaining good graces and with stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">bribery and corruption bujely without any hindrance and people walked to the elections with a prodaným voice... "charakterní people the office at all neucházeli, so one was as a result of this disruption was the state eight months without konzulů".... "began to talk about the fact that the only remedy in a bad situation is indeed samovláda and that it should be a strong man." appiános is thought to pompeia, but became the Caesar, which changed it took on democracy in samovládu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, as well as in antice is the current society based on reckless preference their own benefit regardless of celospolečenský interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is not inherently unable to understand and apply celospolečenský benefit.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform the deeper nature.</seg>
<seg id="43">kauzalitu the fascist and Communist regimes so we have found in the reckless economic liberalisation of the 19th and 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="44">for the current state of the demise of these systems can be in favour of a liberal democracy, such as a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">particularly disastrous is completely ignore the fact that the elite in the future possible statisícové loss of life, the humanitarian and social disaster, which we have now seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">repeal of the law on public work is not a solution, at least not permanent.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition both on the international and European level of interior of the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms to strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company in favour of the state.</seg>

<seg id="1">The architects of the mvrdv are proof that the real adventure neodehrávají only in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built mountain books - 2 pictures</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"The building seems to me to be cheerful, looks futuristicky. Finally is once again to see something interesting," says lisette verhaig that goes around after the roads.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan spermon the techniques in the middle of a large company, is: "of course, this is a nice House."</seg>
<seg id="4">I wonder, however, what we need today library.</seg>
<seg id="5">all have the Internet, ipady and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily no one not, or Yes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, settlements in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth the visit, holding special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">This community with 80 000 people, the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">to resolve this stupid situation, there were a few years ago the decision to contribute to the general education and to build seven nicely pomalovaných železobetonových miniatures fictitious bridges that are vyobrazené on euro notes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive but was not the sheer.</seg>
<seg id="11">and so the urban councillors know that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">winy Maas of rotterdamského architectural studio mvrdv, master wildly brave sloupcových graphs and contractor for vtipných, often even cynical buildings, adopted a thing with the usual stoicism and the competition in 2003 appeared with five books under his arm and úšklebkem on my face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the Commission even ohromeně rozhlížela around and krčila shrug vršil free Maas some presents to themselves according to the size and its aktivisticky zdůvodněnou conclude the words "kind of urban community."</seg>
<seg id="14">So this is my proposal for a mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, mountain for EUR 30 million navršena.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of the revitalizačního project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few surrounding residential and ordinary home with a total of 50 flats.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November was mountain books vyznamenána second place "best library of NL 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the cost of the Dutch national wood award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">maloměstská šeď, which has been unable to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly town hall, for which white facade would you rather expected mlékárnu is thanks to richer on a bit of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">First of all, but it has now Spijkenisse first public cultural building in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to paper</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: čtenářské eldorado will under poklopem cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="23">The means of the mountains while the elevator, but the real spatial and čtenářské passions discover to walk in negotiations with topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">from all sides prosklený interior is bright and clear, floors of páleného kabřince and elegant street lucerny clearly express the atmosphere of the square.</seg>
<seg id="25">the urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see the Park iron garden, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">and everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"normally costs Shelvings with books along fronts and in the midst of a dark room, which is usually neútulný and impersonal," says winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have the classic prostorovou configuration turned upside down and we have room for readers vysunuli from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">vnitřek mountains of books is cleverly exploited: on Wednesday, are the offices of the library, šachový club, environmental centre and ústředna House technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special potěchou are black police on books that are one lining the walls, one parapetem and sometimes zábradlím down the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The structure and the stench is cize.</seg>
<seg id="33">the unknown building material kroutí heads even zapřisáhlí architects and engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recyklovanými materials," says joop trouborst, head of the project in the urban Spijkenisse, to the question of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">and so we are in one fríském farm one day come up against a waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years the sklenících and in the fields in the Netherlands is used as the basis under the roots of milimetrové fleece from synthetic matter.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a cheap and effective.</seg>
<seg id="38">thin textiles for one, two season and then it is ripe for being in bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">The library was the fleece - for the first time in this volume - slisováno on boards with a thickness of four inches.</seg>
<seg id="40">between the heat and the pressure of the so-called landbouwplastic (klp) zbarví in dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that stinks of a little as a new car and a bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 will take you to the top of the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the nearly 500 metres long, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also holandskými kroketami and fíkusy in květináčích.</seg>
<seg id="43">They are the caretakers of the atmosphere, but mainly on the right of the humidity in the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"You might believe, but this House is despite many skleněným plochám a project, in terms of the environment," says trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">vytápí and chladí Earth's heat.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although mountain books costs under skleněným poklopem, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad lepené wooden vazníky, which is the major axis to prosklené façade, serves as the and capture a large part of the solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest will fully automatic rolety.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan spermon, initial sceptic of the industry, have visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even lisette verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">and also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia bogarde that boekenberg even referred to as "long awaited soul" Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: each of the city's population was a few weeks ago invited to the opening of the book from his personal funds to pay one.</seg>
<seg id="55">should first be sealed optical gaps in not yet fully equipped library, which currently includes 70 000 units.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has been proven.</seg>
<seg id="57">police are crowded with completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that, thanks to our invitation now has a new house each of a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his knížka is part of the building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is only as an embellishment.</seg>
<seg id="62">This mvrdv zadařilo in Royal discipline in technical jargon says the identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse written literary history.</seg>

<seg id="1">szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role '</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen szaboa that Berlin is close to the edge of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week, signalled that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinians observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen szabo: Germany doesn't support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, the Germany because of its special relationship with Israel must be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I think, that will not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, was too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained during the vote, when it comes to establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, in the end, pushed through NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy away from the policy, which was run by the US, as it were, in the direction of German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are between two lines.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think the role of the only have taken hold, but they are on the road to more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">In foreign policy, as they do in France or in the UK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">what specifically is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">shows preparedness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that the German foreign policy, economic policy is motivated, export and its relations with some areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other powers, and must therefore Germany to protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, particularly in states around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">That is why it must be careful to neodstrašilo public, but not the elites in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I would not like this but not to give too much of it is not completely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">In any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">damaged Germany's relations with the US, when Germany in the case of both important decision-making abstentions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe, and even in the US there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not think that it was as dramatic as a watershed in the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps even Germany are extracted some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It signals that must be considered as an international player and its interests have to be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, in contrast, clearly expressed for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences between the US and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences have always existed as a result of the internal policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has some secret by a great deal of sympathy for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But as a result of the political situation cannot hold this position, of course, publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that differences of opinion are not really as great as always seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not at all happy with any power netanjahuovou policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is exactly what the Germans difficult.</seg>
<seg id="46">for the Germans, of course, would be a bit easier if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They cannot be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward from its own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">Yet this is precisely what they are doing with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It was always a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think it is clear that the Germans must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as a major international player? wants to take the role at all?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still accustomed to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country is still difficult to play a greater role for obvious reasons.</seg>
<seg id="56">When, for example, look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role for protiněmecké mood.</seg>
<seg id="57">do not that the Germans facilitate.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is, in fact, the old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable to all neighbours and views and that is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">US influence in European politics now is constantly falling, however, the EU this vacuum currently nevyplňuje. who is otherwise there?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they do not like them is unpleasant and it will be even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stephen szabo is the Director of transatlantic Academy in Washington, the Institute, in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America, study challenges the transatlantic community.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>

<seg id="4">For this is a label that is quite officially registered in China, but the company has nothing to do with the original.</seg>
<seg id="5">of protection, however, as long as it is nezažalují real brand owners.</seg>
<seg id="6">and even then it is not clear whether the domohou rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"for foreigners, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect its brand in China," says Thomas pattloch, a lawyer in the office Taylor wessing, which specializes in protective rights violations in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">every week přistane on my work table a new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">counterfeiters have just a few letters, so that they can log their brand.</seg>
<seg id="10">of the Gucci brand, for example, will become lu-gucci and instead of Prada will register prada-kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way they are legally kopírovány German firms to be sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">pattloch opens pořadač records Trademark Office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, there was one Chinese company to protect brand zegna df Puma artificial name that parazituje and the House ermenegildo zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in copying and violations of intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="15">in large cities are několikapatrové trade houses, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="16">pattlochovy cases but are different from the mandate of its mandantů is opposed to Chinese firms have received from the Trademark Office is officially use the right, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "bang mingpai" přidružená brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word has been focused on the "bang dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">The women are intended to catch the rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"is this trade, we must fight," calls on pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is lost, the sole position will disappear, image damage is huge."</seg>
<seg id="23">financial losses and the cost of the affected industries running into the millions, especially for expensive product demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to company data for market research clsa of 15 billion euros per year, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and market, which is growing quickly.</seg>
<seg id="25">výmazu dubious record in the register brands can, however, be a difficult and something that is.</seg>
<seg id="26">management can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">pattloch tells about the cases when the Court rejected claims, because vytýkaný name became a reality of "market for a long time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When the prosecution has the misfortune to plagiátorovi still pay, because the damage its brand in China, says pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there is a law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cases relate to the graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the Daimler lost legal dispute with producer construction machinery sany, enterprise, which recently took over the German manufacturer of pump betonovou mix putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese may therefore still use emblem, similar to the stars of Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company geely, which bought Volvo, originally used modrobílé logo, which like BMW. dispute was settled, geely had to change the logo.</seg>
<seg id="34">fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with padělateli from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known krokodýla otočili in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.</seg>
<seg id="36">známkový office ctmo while accepting that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of employees and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">But last year, the supposedly "the work process back from emergency situation to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of management about the opposition fell 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">57 000 of these cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints handling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">to take something is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is often the case in China, they are imponující figures.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year was ctmo delivered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is nearly a third more than 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record, and it means that China podesáté behind leads the list of new applications throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is also true for the number of all applicable of brands - there are a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 was selected in charges 1.8 billion renminbi.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simply put, this means that every check-in on average costs 1280 renminbi, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">start against this dispute is několikanásobek, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">This koncern for more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans made that would eliminate the illegal production of imitovaných car parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">But padělatel secure the rights to track Freudenberg continue.</seg>
<seg id="52">We ourselves failed to pick up on, because the surname in Germany cannot be protected, says hanno wentzler, chairman of the board of the company Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">známkový office ctmo then also rejected the order at the company.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the other two instancích while Freudenberg domohl rights, but opponents in the dispute is further still.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We need to give the terrible care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The matter is now before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">wentzler has confidence that it would lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">It also says: "management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">internal costs cannot be measured in the companies had to see even a hundred years old files to submit evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago the company Freudenberg giving in vain offered "high šestimístnou amount in euros" for the purpose of settling the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"you can see what it means for us," says wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will hit Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">and when there are imitátoři ensure vulnerable brand.</seg>
<seg id="64">A Chinese manufacturer, for example, I log in Germany the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of the business koncern long ago gave up, yet managed to avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"We need to be terrible care," says wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and attorney pattloch advises German businesses, to be very careful in trade with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international známková subscribe would rather have "all that is in any way to protect the rights of foreigners in China," says wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the company Freudenberg of giving in the last act of the drama to the brand, then you will have to pay licensing fees for its own name, explains wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or will we pushed in the disputed segment of the market.</seg>

<seg id="34">facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">which are the most sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bakteriálním SPI restricted syfilis, chlamydie and kapavka (gonorea).</seg>
<seg id="37">often get the latest virus SPI, HIV, the human papilomaviry, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">muňky and svrab belongs to parazitárním SPI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">who belongs to the Group of the most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">syfilis and kapavka occur mainly among men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Institute of Robert kocha stems from the fact that at least four of the five all cases syfilidy, that have been reported in Germany, are transmitted sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often chlamydiové infection trichomonády, kandidóza (blight), kapavka and human papilomaviry.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is between heterosexuálními adults in our extended relatively little, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections is in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the case of minors, chlamydiové infections are significantly more often than for other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections on young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">For us, the case of minors often found human papilomaviry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How to put the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">the number of infected syfilidou, according to the constitution, Robert kocha from 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 disease in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">the number of new HIV infections has been shrinking since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 was approximately 2 700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about one tenth of less than a year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The signs are pointing to sexual disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the mutilation, difficulties in urination, výtok, pain in podbřišku postulate or wart.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, don't cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">the use of condoms can reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer 100% protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">as the source of the infections may partly be transferred to sexually transmitted diseases of impurities and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">So experts recommend, particularly in the case of frequent sexual partners, the regular rotation.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis is possible cure most SPI and prevent the consequences later.</seg>

<seg id="72">In fact, quite strange in the country, where the King officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King mswati III, is known for his nemírným lifestyle.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what does the "principle"?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists this unclear wording and its associated právnický free space use for stricter interpretation of šaríi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At the very least, it highlights the newly added section: in all matters relating to šaríi, it is necessary to deal with university al-azhar, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a great impact on the whole of the Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may not, but may mean that klérus will be to supervise the legislations, which justice has de facto prison clear-headedness.</seg>

<seg id="22">These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody until 11 000 civilians.</seg>
<seg id="24">As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and support its morality and values."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">It is legally worded so vaguely that it through this section of the institutions of the state can even control the content of the film art and literature.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">After all, no section in writing does not draw explicit equality between men and women.</seg>

<seg id="6">Let this week lie.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you get a sense of the paralyzing stench rakfisku, one of the largest of delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">there is snow, spectacular views - and the pervasive stench hangs in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">rakfisk is nasolený pstruh kvašený in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want to fish páchla.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"dreaming is raw and then zapijete full aquavitu," says havard halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called "rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">all around us, people eat the small fish and zapíjejí is large quantities of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"some people would rather have aquavit than rakfisk," says havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">drink can trump the stench.</seg>
<seg id="16">a few pieces I will.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it is not so bad - it is a bit by bit sushi, which was on a long journey by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">rakfisk is a product of a very different time, when it was in Norway, poverty, and because there were still fridge, fish in the autumn namáčely to vzduchotěsných casks with water and salts.</seg>
<seg id="19">then in the middle of winter, when they were well zkvašené, vytáhly and snědly senses - undoubtedly otupily alcohol.</seg>

<seg id="29">the Norwegians can hardly believe that, in their peaceful country one of them was able to such brutality and murder.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">for the wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s of the twentieth century.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">My crisis mexicko-americké identity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those that have left; they are hard times, says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">navarrette says that Mexican Americans are lapeni between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely prodral mob and I arrived in the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I encountered a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Darts showed to one of the two fronts: one for "mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there a few seconds, and I did not know where I have to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California and the life I was called "mexičanem."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the same as the ethnic when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves as "Italy."</seg>
<seg id="10">So later I ended up in the "Mexican American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">and in the home of my Grandpapa was not necessary to use shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to manage both sides of the conversation in that language.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have, however, vocabulary rodilého speaker and I cannot get rid of us přízvuku.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out my American passport and put in front of "extranjeros."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about the time when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pen nieto visited President Obama in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="18">on the agenda were the issues that probírají, when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pen nieto I also talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the same likelihood that Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">wants to join with the United States and Canada and the European Union to create similar trade bloc in North America.</seg>
<seg id="21">and pen nieto promised that will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although did not provide any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico is a complicated relationship with the United States and full of unpleasant feeling.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never nepomyslela to the fact that the United States invaded in 1848 Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite the half of Mexico's territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who thinks of centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So one minute after the United States representative says something a little critical of Mexico, you hear in the press and among the elite complaints about how Americans are in the sovereignty of its neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="26">and children montezumy moving on the path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, the relationship is the real challenge for Mexico to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">you want to talk about the hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">These are a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of that country offers opportunities, and others that do not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at some point our family tree a person, perhaps the parent or prarodič, which was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">and more often than it seemed to fit the profile of the person - the location of the weak, the education of the poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their children and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">not against Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And now we are living the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="36">our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">and we are aware that many among this elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class us dislike.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as the race, which is not enough to be Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">our existence is, in their view, only about the failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico neselhaly, so it never neopustily.</seg>
<seg id="44">and we are now nenalézali imprisoned for hedvábnou curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still lost BC).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, as well as in childhood legally přicestovala reminds me of the tension that exists between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the United States, because the Mexicans more understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although it is občankou the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">and at the same time, many Mexican Americans, that I know feel as part of either.</seg>
<seg id="48">love listening to the Mexican groups tigres del Norte, but also Bruce springsteena.</seg>
<seg id="49">you get the best of both countries, but you don't have the roots in either.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico view us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">and we have considered the Mexicans in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">and to complicate relations with some of its leaders want to and some of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, reconnect with diasporou.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to Mexican Americans work for Mexico as "provisional ambasadoři" and they were the Mexican interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American citizens, how great it is to visit the country, and push for political leaders to forge relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">No.</seg>
<seg id="56">This is not so.</seg>
<seg id="57">too many hostile feeling.</seg>
<seg id="58">and thanks to income inequality and a widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not certain that this is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it is up to you, Amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">This is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States to act with Mexico before one and a half century and must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignation for the way in which it was discussed with members of their family in considerably closer to the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">We may be more "Mexicans" than I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">The old battles, the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such case was in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual unnecessary guesses as to who started, many buildings have been changed in the rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. and, for the first time the rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even if it appears that Israelis and Palestinians are stranded in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are zachyceni in nastalém chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will mean that their fight will be even krvavější than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that this could break their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither vyhraná or a lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems that, at present, there are many reasons for optimizmu.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if a cease-fire reached 21 November vydrželo fight this week strengthened hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, while Gaza has suffered defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and rate of 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the poorest global and the most populous parts of the planet, with Israel nor Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas gaining influence in the West Bank, which is currently managed by the Palestine, his are ardent rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, Hamas leaders may very well decide that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">Islamists across the Arab world have more influence, so Hamas won the rich and powerful friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, znovuvzkříšená regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has added to the Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">cheering people from Hamas say that Islamic Crescent spans around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where a party/militia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly drawn to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies of the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">and, above all, on the southern end of Israel's changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammad mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, secular tyrant, who ruled for 30 years until its collapse in Egypt in 2011, not time on Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, the Brotherhood is bratrancem Hamas and its leaders are more ovlivnitelní public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future the Hamas diplomacy can appear as a player, which cannot be ruled out Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terminology was Hamas stored back into boxes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's anti-missile system iron kopule proved their worth and many Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">the Israelis can sleep better - for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic language is America, unfailing as always, many European countries also vinyl Hamas from the start of the latest round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">and in particular - Israel to prosper, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has mostly ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was relatively calm in Israel from the suicide bomb bombers, in part thanks to the wall, which is the Palestinian state in the West Bank, the main part of what may be the one, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are growing despite its protiprávnost against international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the start of the campaign in the elections held on 22 January merged with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why by those proradné Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If it really ruled in the West Bank, neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better if we keep them for the walls and praštíme is when vystrčí heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will have won, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries have Israel too in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israeli defence spending is higher than spending all his four Arab neighbours together.</seg>
<seg id="38">the launch of a new war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab remember to heal him its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that President mursí worked with President Barack Obama to reach a cease-fire is a good sign and can be the beginning of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">also the Israelis should look at the situation in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, a denial of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination is the keg, which must one day burst in areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus, which exploded in Tel Aviv last week.</seg>
<seg id="42">at the time of the repression of democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of the situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to drive Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is what think reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two States, when Israel went territory for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is little chance that the cease-fire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little more influence to push this issue.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar have to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Arabs outside must also push for the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the immediate offer virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In his first term zanedbal presentation of its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House, seems to be equally zdráhavý in its entry in the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">tobacco companies claimed that the law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and dostupnějším cigaretám.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the world of the Internet is not so bad to be znuděný</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The last day díkuvzdání I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am not going to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">For half a day at the airport for the next years is much pesky, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iphonem (not to mention duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come with praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that it is good for us (and our children) is sometimes boring.</seg>
<seg id="8">This forces the brain to go to interesting directions, which can promote creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">and given that most of us today is constantly connected to any screen, we do not have the chance to enjoy the ennui.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So we should support the ennui?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">and no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will come back to that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, as well as many people I assumed that boring is a relatively new phenomenon that has happened with the arrival of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as Peter says toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history in the Canadian university in Calgary, who is the author of the book boredom boredom: a lively history (history) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, a long history is boring," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The walls in pompejích Latin inscription was found on boredom, coming from the first century AD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define ennui.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been defined and discussed many different ways, said John D. eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in ontariu in Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After watching the research literature and transfer ideas the Group of about 100 people Professor eastwood and his colleagues defined ennui as experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">boring from apathy distinguishes this, that person is not involved in anything, but I would be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that there is no urge to do something for the apathy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that at the heart of boredom is the attention "of the process, the bad mood and a sense of slowly ubíhajícího time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">boring can remind a lot of depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor eastwood said that while the relationship may have have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, see the problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that nudíme when we only have problems with concentration.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal caused by psychological science, Professor eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article from the magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups learned first hand loud and unrelated television programme in a side room, others have heard it so quietly that it barely noticed, while the third group did not hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard a television programme silent hlásili greater ennui, than the other two groups - had difficulties in concentration, but were not sure why and to these difficulties boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you are trying to focus on the difficult or poutavý task of attention can lead to boredom, said mark J. fenske, professor of Neurosciences at the University of guelph in ontariu and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when you do something nudného," such as a bad components on the line, the distraction of music can help with this, keep you busy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, we now know that kroucení and čmárání, who are often seen as a sign of boredom, may actually help nudou fight and keep people physically be more alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"research shows that children who is allowed vrtět, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We have all experienced some ennui - my flight delays, hučící speaker, especially a lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">The scientists developed in the 1980s to help with the measurement of boredom "scale for susceptibility to nudění" (boredom proneness scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale covers issues such as: "many of the things that I have to do is repeated and monotónních, 'and' I have so much interest that do not have the time to do them all.."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With these stupnic scientists have found that boys tend to get bored with more often than girls, said Stephen vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimulus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, teenagers are generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991 he larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">found that 32 per cent of teenage said that nudili in school and in dělání domestic tasks, while 23 percent said that nudili when not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3% of parents said that the nudili.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he said that he knows that "growing up is the time for ennui," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people is not because of a lot of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: "is boring for you good?."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, played a gambling or abused the addictive substances as a way to reduce it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between nudou and creativity, said Professor vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"boring is the way the brain, to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain is always the most appropriate thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If nudíte and use this energy to play on the guitar and cooking, you will be pleased to do.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you watch TV, you will do the joy, not just for a moment in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child nudí and you give him the iPad, it will not be bored, but nenaučí to take itself or of controlling, said Professor fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"This independent governance is passed on from one situation to the other," said the professor.</seg>
<seg id="54">your child is nenaučí only to take itself, but will be more self-control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that we really want to celebrate ennui.</seg>
<seg id="56">But even against it we should not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our aim should rather be feel comfortable when we from the reach of drnčení activities and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor eastwood agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We are accusing it of needs more bored with, but boring is painful, restless, the desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"in the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is difficult to find ways to take when the noise turned off."</seg>

<seg id="1">in Colorado, there is no manual on the new law on marihuaně</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">devatenáctiletý Anthony orozco, a student at the vocational school and higher player from south-eastern colorada, faces charges of criminal offences for what will soon be legal in the state - for possession of several grams of marijuana and cigar, which used for smoking it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr orozco said that one September day he went with a few pals in lamaru, on the plains near the border with kansasem, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a police officer found the cannabis in the car, it was Mr orozco issued subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment to drug use - petty, for which is fine for every $100 - and he was established for the Court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We acted as the criminals," said Mr orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after coloradském vote on the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use is the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases on the ground rather than on the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has been here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures, abolished.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police department to stop blaming the adults at the age of 21 years and older for possession of a small amount of which is legally allowed, after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in the most conservative districts colorada said that will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, a number of cities from the suburbs denveru towards Western mountains is voting to prevent the opening of the new state licencovaných stores marihuanou in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"this matter is developing so fast that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. oates, the chief of police in the town of Aurora, East of denveru.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The heads of the drbou and regulators in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="14">for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale of all of the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, whether for better or for worse, is the first before the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use, first of all, and now the holiday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for licensing to sell alcohol the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Mr Smith acknowledged, no place or system cannot do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent under which we could manage," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, the so-called i-502, is to take effect on December 6, which also leaves the vacuum, during which will still not be a state licensing system, but legal possession of yes.</seg>
<seg id="20">and there are complex mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, for example, how to balance state directive on "appropriate" access to a licensed marihuaně with its ban on trade with konopím in 330 metres away from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with konopím than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the center for legal cannabis, recently based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November sent police chief of oates e-mail its officers from the town of Aurora, in which they announced that the prosecutor will prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each citizen 21 years old and that the police "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief of oates said that the police will promote urban laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">in the district of weld in northern Colorado is a district prosecutor Ken buck stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">currently faces charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences, which was crimes at a time when they occurred," said Mr buck in its statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was complicated in places like rural district Mesa, where voters rejected marihuanovou initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">police in Grand junction, the city district, already adults blame for possession of a small amount.</seg>
<seg id="30">district prosecutor, Pete hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to nezamítnout all the cases of possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not think that I am losing my continuing my time until the change in law enforcement," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent plains voters support the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">and contradictory response across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">for district prosecutors "cultural barriers," said Sean mcallister, a lawyer from denveru, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, and local spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"the prosecution of people spent so much of his life, that they still cannot really accept that this is legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states to build a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington State on track national test cases for the legalisation of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">advocates and state authorities are planning a new threshold for regularised sales and also anxious ahead of the guidelines from the federal government, which is still in the plan as the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Defenders of the legalization of marijuana, hoping that the justice ministry complies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several arrests shop clerks marijuana for medical purposes and patients who use it, which have attracted attention, has most of the federal government deals with medical marihuanou in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States in the operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While protidrogoví agents will probably not vyrážet door to zachytili a small bag with drogou, it is likely that they will revolt allowing state regulated shops with recreational marihuanou permitted new laws, said Kevin A. sabet, a former adviser on drugs policy of the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">several plains cities have the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">The day before the election, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new shops with marihuanou, although it will still take about a year before it can open any trade.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week the city montrose in the West of the State proposed six-month ban and it is likely that comes into force next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to find themselves in a situation where someone go down a license and then we will have a federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">our Community voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are looking at this as voted for the Community, compared to what the state voted.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people, for which it is their work hell, and so are working literally in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case with anta wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living dobýváním sulphur from the volcano kawah ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of this, every day fárat to bottom kráteru where escape sirné gases from inside the country and in contact with the air is in solid shape.</seg>
<seg id="6">After vyseká large blocs of sulphur, which together weighing up to 70 does the kilo of draw is on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets after harsh do wandering.</seg>
<seg id="7">On top of the volcano, which is a 2 386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but vyčerpaným nosičům takes over 40 minutes than vystoupají želvím pace up because they maintain a balance and thoroughly rozvažují their steps to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any klopýtnutí could become life, as it has become one of the French turistce, which years ago dove from rocks kawah ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">miners kawah ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur, which are extracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When they are at the top, leading the way around tourists who is fotografují, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and unaveně odnášejí difficult bin to the weight that the mining company has put a little below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a company PT candi ngrimbi that benefits in a live volcano since 1960 and never apply their workers more than 656 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">It sells for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemickému industry, as this nerost has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of zápalek, fun pyrotechniky, cosmetics, dynamitu and even, sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"because normally wear 70 kilo of, we earn some 46 000 rupees (EUR 3.8) for each way," explains us anto, which usually have a tertiary three trips a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way it takes three hours and at the end of the destruction, but can then earn their 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this seems a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what it earned on the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the daily wage miners there is very high, for example, for the collection of coffee is 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for 14 days is two million rupees (€167)," explains carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as zedník.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his pay 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not as hard, but anto returned with his family to banyuwangi village near the volcano from serious reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as síra: "I married with a young child from Bali, which is Hindu, and I took it to jávu to converted to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">anto has asthma, badly he breathes, still not and eyes has podrážděné toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In its 27 years of anto three times daily risks life in a live volcano kawah ijen, whose síra on it already began to take its toll, although my face protected special mask and spectacles.</seg>
<seg id="20">has asthma, badly he breathes, still not and its eyes are podrážděné toxic gases to escape from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price that must be paid for, to get his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work two more years, because I want to open up trade or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This fine and intelligent young man stižený fate could be a tourist guide, číšníkem or recepčním in hotel, and instead of doing the work for.</seg>
<seg id="24">shares of dirty wooden chatrč with other nosiči and every day vstává in two hours in the morning, because síra night continues to build up and its distinctive yellow color changes in blue and September darkness visible.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the tmu fárá anto to kráteru and shines a light on the way little svítilnou by připevněnou on helmě, and bought it for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">about 400 sales yields on the shoulders of the bin brimstone from DNA kráteru</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has high incomes, sulphur mining because of cost savings nezmechanizovala, and does not provide nosičům workers on their own and with such efforts, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, do not receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the surcharge for the shooting, which, along with a ticket for 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) by watchdogs natural park from tourists who come to vyfotografovali volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for livestock, and not for the people," argues madrusin, statný 42letý carrier, who works in kawah ijen for three decades, since he left school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> can handle uzvednout to 110 kilo of and assures us that can work," as long as they can," because it needs the money for the education of their three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not go into retirement, umřu here, because the volcano has been my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although síra a cervix and from their accumulated droppings stings in the eyes, when the wind turns unexpectedly and polapí miners in hustých výparech that come from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them nestěžuje that suffers from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory difficulties artrózy, knees and the pain caused by the weight of the baskets on the shoulders.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">unainik, which balances its basket on the back, in its 53 years can do for a kilo of 50.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his colleagues vydolují in a live volcano 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three lorries odvážejí a sharp line between houštím in store in tamansari remote 18 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I will not go into retirement, umřu here, because the volcano has been my whole life," says unainik and opens up the broad mouth, in which a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">The oldest of his five sons 30-year, also makes the mining of sulphur.</seg>

<seg id="5">It may seem incredible that this is part of the advertising slogan for mentolové sweets, but still - or perhaps because of it, the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">these sentences are part of rapu, which uses local allusions of giving "buchtu into pipes" as it makes a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">advertising agency bbh, which created the video, hopes that they will draw attention to the problem of this advertising vtipným way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Artistic Director of Douglas Hamilton says that I use of music for people to meet their "civic duty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"It is only a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we feel that this is a subject that we must touch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government tried to expand on a lot of things as perfume with feromony or organise cognitive parties.</seg>
<seg id="13">While many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we are pomysleli, why not to do the nejkreativnější possible thing, such as the composition of rapu to solve this problem."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Those who did not take it too lightly, it is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">a year spent $1 300 to encourage citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The government's package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 to the child, the maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all these measures have little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technologies in South-East Asia, also known konzervatizmem their leaders and strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the classification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered the level of recovery, in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why singapurci do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei mingová, Director of marriage and the family of the national office for population says that this is because of the "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"So people are available to a wider range of options in terms of the goals and priorities, it is not only the wedding and family," explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to delay marriage and bring children. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">While there have been efforts in the immigration policy drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people it caused resentment among local residents.</seg>
<seg id="28">on some of the Singapore website is seen explicit xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who have been criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year recorded its worst election result since the beginning of the independence of the Singapore government.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election appeared to deal with the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the decline in birth rates has known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health and immigration policy in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to make the nestavělo so small home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">to start, for example, affect trade in real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The urban development authority to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boxes from Shine," which can build in some urban areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have a 46 square meters and had great success in prodejnosti.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is a fear that these apartments can encourage mládenecký lifestyle and deter developers to build large family houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew soon, the director of the developer of the developers, says that their "box from Shine" to sell far more quickly than more houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"they are popular, and they are sold on days to weeks faster than houses with greater size.</seg>
<seg id="40">So are much better for our cash flow."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, admits that the new standards set clearer rules developers who were previously restrained when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">too become stressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although the new rules could seek to increase the birth rate of the nation, the conversation singapurci workers in the financial district in the centre of the city suggests that they will have a great effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"people are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people to be postponed," says a young officer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"others whether they have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">But it is important for me to rely on their own time and money," says another, about a 20-year-old man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">men and women mention career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So whatever government to citizens to force to have children, they are still ultimately singapurci, who have the last word on the family.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">marrielos porrasová notes that academic worker Marc prensky, a graduate pedagogiky at Yale University and the author of the article digital natives and digital immigrants, these concepts to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">"digital natives are children and young people who were born in a time of this technology.</seg>

<seg id="45">He explains that this is a complex issue," because we are asking them to rozeznávali what is appropriate to publish and what to say, no, on the contrary, in an age when still not zralí."</seg>
<seg id="46">also to be - with regard to the area - rozvážní, at a time when, after what is most to be oblíbení, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," adds.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="47">According to this specialistky is the most effective way to children and dospívajícím show, what is privacy, ask questions, which makes them think.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">further marrielos porrasová lists some of the options: are things that you stranger nevyprávěl, so why this re doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">or: like those, if someone published your email dive as you those published kamarádovu?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the rest of you publish?</seg>

<seg id="53">and one more: they need to constantly all know what is re doing?</seg>
</p>

<seg id="54">Another point is, to realise that they have to behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.</seg>
<seg id="55">The rules are the same.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV perú that Europeans "kill" in World War II and in other conflicts, "but now are practically one country."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which support the Unasur member countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the free movement of citizens and workers is required in any of the countries of South America, which is already under way between members of the Andean Community, however, there are more regressive, which we want to go back to the past," pointed out.</seg>

</p>

<seg id="7">"those who are at the forefront, never to use force does not oblige, and we jihoameričané, everything will sign.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">President Correa has confirmed that this decision nelituje because it betrayed its principles and respect its "deep democratic values and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">Add to that at the time "there were credible allegations that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, the Swedish justice, which asked him to Swedish territory underwent interrogation because of alleged sexual deliktu," own the Swedish legislation allows for interrogation videokonferenčním hovorem, which could take place from ekvádorského Embassy in London."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk that the assangeho there is a deterioration in the physical and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken to him since, what is in our embassies, but Ambassador informed me that my small pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," said ekvádorská head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"but there is that his physical and psychological condition worse, because it is closed on a small area without the movement of the fresh air.</seg>
<seg id="15">This would affected the health of everyone," added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">President Correa noted that the asylum granted Assange since June on ekvádorském Embassy in London on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and point out that London held talks to resolve the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"We on human rights nevyjednáváme, such a word in this case, but not always talks taking place.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa used the situation to be presented as a defender of the freedom of the press, and make it clear that it does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie that undermine freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">The greatest enemies of free press are not we podlí and evil politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit nátlaků and blackmail," he said.</seg>

<seg id="23">From this point of view, expressed delight at the even takovíto journalists," or bankers or hegemonic country and even speak of the bourgeoisie "Ecuador and předeslal, that if it is re-elected," will continue in the changes brought the right way and in the right direction. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto paraguayi on membership in the Union, Unasur at least until the next election and argued that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus riddle wrapped in the legality," because in fact "undermine the legitimacy of paraguayské democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Ecuador's president said that, in addition, considers "completely appropriate" fusion of the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries now, in time for the ruling by the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">conflicts are unavoidable, but it must be overcome will go along.</seg>

<seg id="1">AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the outcome of the test: HIV positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if to me, lightning," tells in the memories of the moment of truth that a doctor tried to "moderate" a bit, but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">a boy before family tajil.</seg>
<seg id="5">decided to take their disease itself on their shoulders and began to inform and with such commitment, that already celebrated 43. birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of nejdávnějších units of HIV patients in the civil hospital in guadalajaře (hcg), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio live with the human virus used (HIV) from 22 years, which was unthinkable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">then with him or the clinic Director of Mexico's social security Institute (imss) nerozloučil," because he had the cutting blow."</seg>
<seg id="9">Then the AIDS have been synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is a lot of people who know about their disease and come only when the virus caused the death of the organism and vysílil immune system, and then become victims of random infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since there have been documented cases of the disease AIDS, or at least since the first in the world," is a great success that the patient's life expectancy, which will begin in a timely and appropriate manner with treatment, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade villanueva HIV troops in the civil hospital in guadalajaře that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">infektolog and specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is death, but the judgment that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability the patients' immune system, which is diagnosed with the disease, with better are those who are taking drugs: people with 200 cells cd4 can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cells cd4 up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that the one who is HIV diagnostikováno in 25 years, according to these findings can "in compliance with treatment to live up to 75 years without any problems," the doctor explained in an interview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">to highlight the progress of this it is worth recalling that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the death rate has fallen significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6 railway twice in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (a common agenda for the HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">only in the state of Jalisco in 2011 255 people died and in May of this year, 187, but since 2005, is to ensure universal access to antiretrovirotikům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - why people continue to die of the disease?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - "It seems to me that the problem is not in the opportunities for access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is how I see it like this is happening in the US in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the last 12 years we have not run out of medical supplies, the problem is that patients come in very advanced, because they do not know the condition of, or in late stage disease."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">adds compelling figure: "nine out of ten patients comes as the show some přidružená infection. All that more needs to be done to influence the overall mortality rate is used to diagnose the disease, and therefore need to be on a large scale to offer tests to identify the disease all the people who ask for them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincides with specialists and officials from the National Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to do tests to private laboratories just because he did his friend, and despite its low age there have also suffered from the outbreak of AIDS and kaposiho sarkomem, cancer, which is one of the complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that umřou, and do not want to know anything more.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I have to die, rather, three times a week vyřádím," they say, but that is not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, the healthy cvičím, taking drugs."</seg>
<seg id="28">To this day, his parents knows only that suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"žiju normal life as anyone.</seg>
<seg id="30">I work, I have a lot of activities, I, I am an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for themselves and on the other person," Fabrizio lists, which adopted a call to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco to today in the World AIDS Day encouraged those who fear their testimony.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"the tests will be done if the risk of whether knows as soon as possible, whether they are HIV positive, it is better if it were diagnostikováni, whether they realise that they can live as anyone else when they are responsible."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">the use of condoms for standing there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds the information on the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="35">and the biggest gaps are in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">in places, this task to actually increase the distribution of condoms," the sooner we have one or two, now give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have to kondomům approach," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">between nejnáchylnějšími to new infections are adolescents.</seg>

<seg id="27">This team should not only mincyho, gausseho, Ramona rivase, Fico López and "piculína" (ortiz), but also there were young (Javier) "toñito" Colón and James Carter, Brothers leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of injuries kolene.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which might not have the perfect composition, but was able to win the gold medal and bring us great joy, it was the team of the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentina's neuquénu.</seg>
