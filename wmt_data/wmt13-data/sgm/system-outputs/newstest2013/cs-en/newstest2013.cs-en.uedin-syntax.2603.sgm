<h1>
<seg id="1">The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify its policy of a necessity of the fight against electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennan's centre, however, such a hoax calls the myth that election fraud is less common than the number of people who die in the United States hit by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, after all, in the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures will partially undermine America's democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada, individual states have the responsibility for the organisation of the federal elections in the US.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in that spirit, a majority of the US government since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult to process the elections or to register on the electoral roll.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which more 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only for 2011 to 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters to present identity card with a photograph and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, zneplatňují odnímají citizens the right to vote and the right to register on the list of voters on election day registration is a clean criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the election, in 2006, called on the electorate půkazu identity photographs with no American state.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first state to introduce this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutionality indianského law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican officials hurried to the enlargement of this process as well as in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last two years to support proposals for such legislation in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to submit to identity cards with photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card, such as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact owns 11% of American citizens, that is, at the age of 21 million people to vote, no identity card with a photograph issued by a government authority of the state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, about five million new voters in 2012 does not have an identity card.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the acquisition of the card is often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are disproportionately affects mainly young people, minorities and low-income people.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years has therefore required identity card with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, who are known as voters to shift to Democratic candidates in several states are not allowed to use their identity card with a photograph displayed his school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other side of the same states allow members to use cards issued by those clubs, hunting or fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates in the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, a certificate of citizenship require no state at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such a requirement led Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011, about a dozen states adopted laws, which require voters to show that they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These actions are obviously going to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.</seg>
<seg id="31">Be it noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators support the laws in eight states in 2011, which removes the registration of voters on election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have their consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">During the campaign for the general elections in 2004, for example, the registration of voters have registered around 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken after 2009 but caused a decline in registering new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican lawmakers then in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state, there were only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">As was the case with Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">24% of the citizens of voting in advance, but made up only 11 percent of all voters.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, whites accounted for 76 percent of all voters were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have turned against the approval of laws that restrict voter registration is, of course, very strongly.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors blocked several bills with his veto.</seg>
<seg id="44">With a view to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">The damage is partly limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of the 34 states adopted laws requiring proof of identity with photographs.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly introduced rules, however, completely undeniably impedes the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics talk about bias approved laws and is regarded as an obvious attempt to influence the results of the election in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">Brennan's report shows that the states where those laws were approved centres of 2011, account for 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed for victory in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is already certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures will partially undermine America's democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">The detection of prostate cancer: Undergo examinations or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA test was sometimes false positive results, which were wrongly negative or even wrong, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of this increased the hesitancy of the men, who are already reluctant even to go for testing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let's investigate or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked two experts on the view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the US has shown a high degree of contamination between test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time in Europe, noted the different mortality rate among patients who undergo testing, and those who go to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also demonstrated after 12letém apart, and that those who go for tests, they have a higher risk of 30 to 40% of that.</seg>
<seg id="9">I recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years, therefore, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their group are also men Afro-American origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision when the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are such species, which are inert and aggressive types of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to explain to correct the patient the degree of danger of his kind of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which is in the long-term impact on life, and to focus instead on the active surveillance of the disease in these cases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men with whom she was diagnosed with cancer, left untreated, as their kind of cancer is not aggressive and is a threat on his life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will propose them instead of active surveillance and, in the case of progression of the disease, offering the treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater precision setting criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and who does not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet recommend testing is complete.</seg>
<seg id="18">The important thing is to determine whether or not it is appropriate to undergo testing and interviewed by a doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created a tool that makes it possible to assess the pros and cons of the Movember movement in connection with PSA testing.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Disease prevention</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite advances in research seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease acceptance of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all healthy eating and sufficiently move, you could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If they stop smoking, that figure would be increased to at least 50%," underscores Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian company for cancer research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% cancer causing heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some percentage also remains totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian company for cancer research remains a priority of the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also a risk factor for several others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today's 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," a spokesman for Andre Beaulieu said, shaking his head.</seg>
<seg id="33">An encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, decreases the risk of death from cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Mass</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Stoutness and obesity, according to SCC, another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal and esophageal, pancreatic and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the event of excessive consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is appropriate to avoid even the sausages, which are subject to the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of smoked meat, or drying, salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent times, various scientists focused on the link between cancer and vitamínovými accessories.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The research, however, has not yet revealed clear conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although, according to one of them, is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks more to increase it.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is clearly demonstrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr Beaulieu insists, furthermore, how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Submit to testing does not mean that you have cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgs boson explored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likelihood of the Higgs discovery bosonu caused a stir last summer.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And it is the last particle whose existence the standard model predicts - our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Among the physicists, however, still not 100 percent certainty that the Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">Doubts about the fact that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgsovu bosonu, as predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">New data released this week during a physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm it, but it still lacks any data so that we can have absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But suppose the Higgs boson, because of the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what's happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world is absolutely unambiguous law, under which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard for it, otherwise you're gonna get hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies even to her: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "status" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">It further divided into two categories of particle physicists.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand we ordered citizens, or fermiony, which obediently comply Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end of the line move bosony, wretched anarchists who do nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means it could be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony is further divided into two groups, according to equipment (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratory: Mesony, here we go unnoticed, and "force particles," which is of great natural strength and with which is Higgs boson probably related in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It must be said, however, that these bosony are not as exotic pets, how it would be possible to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If they read this article, it is thanks bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or particle of light, "which is" holder "of electromagnetic force."</seg>
<seg id="18">When, in fact, inset with particles are accelerated or change its course, "disturbed" by the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "distraction" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than the photon - and hence one bosonů, "geothermal power."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Nor is it with Higgsovým bosonem, except that "disturb" it should be the other field, Higgsovo field, appeared to be the boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it is necessary to achieve very high energy levels, as with the frozen surface of the pond, already ripples just a lot of a large boulder.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason it is to be used as part of a giant accelerator as the accelerator at the laboratory CERN - large Hadron Collider has friendly ties is a circle with a circumference 27 km! - in order to exert the kind of energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field to us once again throws to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and matter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not react with the electromagnetic field because not all particles or all materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, doing so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, never by himself to stick on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And it is true that all the particles do not react with the Higgs field: Those that do have some mass, while the others (as, for example, a photon, look at him) don't have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Mrs. Smith asks to do all of these studies are, what "bring us?"</seg>
<seg id="29">From a scientific point of view, it is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any inconsistency between SM observations and predictions.</seg>
<seg id="30">More than a few physicists, literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open a "new physics" space and close some of the loopholes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It should be noted that the model is still huge gaps, no clarification of gravity (whoa whoa!) or dark matter, which is about 80% of cosmic mass (again).</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, however, the CERN facilities showed such contradictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The response</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The response of this research in everyday life very difficult for Mr. and Mrs. Novákových can be predicted, would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Behold: At the very beginning of the 1960's laser pioneers in Bell Labs had no idea about the revolution is already causing their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Assuming the scientific use, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and he created the first permanent a laser beam (previous beams were pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a toy "to the lab."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, exercise may result from any instruments that surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The sensor, although Boyle's first ever as planned, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, it doesn't mean that the activities of us around the LHC is bound to change your life, but it means that you never really know....</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care - the best way to go from life... | Le devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through his Commission for dying with dignity, Quebek recently engaged in delicate questions concerning the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should soon to continue and, at the same time, about the bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this crucial area, a lot of work remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">The magazine Le devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Only a few weeks before Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Were it seven and five years of my life," he says without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has done its work: The extreme weakness prevents him from himself to go to the bathroom, or to eat alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Resignedly looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is brave and even smiles, talking with strangers who stop by, brings his medication, they offer a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage to a death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, that diminishes me," confers.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, he found a team of doctors in his problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Throughout his life, the man teaches that men urinate standing up," Victor-Gadbois tells Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the facility.</seg>
<seg id="17">To return to the stage for some people, the child is unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"Depending on a person's ability," whether or not to accept the return, says psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the view of many people that deal with the crucial moments, palliative care, taking place at the very core of such a return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who are in a home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">The forecast is a maximum of three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, they do not provide a team of doctors and nurses who cared for them, the so-called "therapeutic" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die of suffocation "fully conscious."</seg>
<seg id="24">The illness but allowed me to find their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I've got good kids," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In my life I have no desire," he says, and then allow us to put her breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet it is still looking forward to the son of Italy's last visit in the coming days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the home of Victor-Gadbois is awarded custody of the body with the help of nutrition in cooperation with a group of volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="29">It looks like palliative care, which is where they can no longer do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">That death was more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Québeku strikes one berth palliative care at 11 700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, if we realise that we all die some day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life goes on in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the medics at the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whatever the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When a man dies, it may give him a sip of brandy or Pepsi, for example, according to taste.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics are no longer required to watch the blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is part of everyday life here.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night Mr X. carrying beer, who died later in the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning drinks beer his son in honor of the deceased father.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Helping patients as well as their relatives," says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the home of Victor-Gadbois coming one after the other, but unlike the other days.</seg>
<seg id="42">The man who is thoroughly enjoying from the last meeting with his family beside třiadevadesátiletého vypodložený on cushions, while his restaurant in his honor, dies tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after testing all options in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"It is half a year here every three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% then from hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering, as soon as the sick person comes into the final phase of his life, whether it's at home, in the hospital and in a halfway house.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and domestic palliative treatment for the Company of Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And just this crucial non-availability of health care in Quebec leads to a series of doctors specialising in palliative care fears the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard LaPointe, in which show their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure all people access to high-quality palliative care, before it will be possible to agree with the implementation of the euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, a patient who had recently spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="52">Fears that patients did not ask for the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, a number of oncologists care their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative forecast.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chance of survival by Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my onkoložce out with the treatment, said that he regrets that I fight, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">And he told me that it's over!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martelová estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanking his treating physicians to fill their wishes, when their team palliative pussy ease the pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it is necessary to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care to patients in palliative care at home for the Company of Grand Montréal prevents the treatment of pain in 8 percent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, that the patient is anesthetized until death, whatever fits and starts, or whether they are administered a sedative to him on a permanent basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot pretend that this part of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">The patient, who beat the pain, will have greater access paliativním sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">The sick, which is not given a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," rather, it means "I want to get rid of the pain."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The implementation of this story has a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in the health sector.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Administration officials roads, public works and entrepreneurs in the construction industry, lobbyists, political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which mix construction, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Even from the beginning of the investigation in 2010," she says, "save only the Ministry of Transport on procurement of a billion dollars," when some people keep in check his instincts to gain market share on them!</seg>

<seg id="12">In recent weeks, a number of local councillors conducted a number of searches and accused of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a municipality on the outskirts of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his office, the mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest of Quebec City.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is suspected that repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Lino Zambito caused a sensation when the commission explained the mechanism of the "system" of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="17">He gave during these years of 3% of the value of the contracts, which have obtained v Montréalu, a middle-man associated with the Mafia, which then transferred the money side of the Union Montréal, for which ran the mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Zambito was generous in all directions after 2000 and spent more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) provincial parties, in particular, however, liberals, who were in power at the time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also confessed to organizing the illegal gathering of finance for the former Liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">The contract with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, a system of "corruption" worked very well.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described him before the commission in great detail: During the ten years had received an invitation to trips, gifts, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and pocket money from construction companies in return for contracts worth a total of $736 000 with penězovody, for which nadsazoval price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other transport sphere of public officials admitted that they had paid the fees that about 30% to 40% overestimate invoices through false víceprací.</seg>
<seg id="24">The organizer of the mayor's Party Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye that without embarrassment squinting over the parallel budget, which was dirty money into his coffers.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the basis of these revelations Tremblay stepped down at the beginning of November, which plunged Montréal into a major crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými members who issued a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="27">As the mayor of the district of Rivière-des-prairies to the east of the island has since 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million promotérům directly in the middle of a prosperous trade with real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of dirty money in election campaigns</seg>
</p>

<seg id="30">The process is "painful but positive," according to her.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it should be set up in Montréalu own investigative unit and supervision to ensure these dubious practices cannot go back.</seg>
<seg id="32">Like cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">On a regular basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were estranged from hundreds of millions of dollars," but fears, in particular, the role of the "deputies informed about this ruse" to those dealing though!</seg>
<seg id="35">Estimates that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from the irony with money laundering, and adds: "I've heard that it was only a weak brew of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit gifts to parties to $100, but that it will not solve the situation: "Until severely restrict election expenses, dirty money from politics will not disappear."</seg>
<seg id="37">It proposes a comprehensive control system for the allocation of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "Lower can't fall; if we focus on the substance of things we can build on a sounder basis again courageously and with greater control and compliance with the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story defamed image abroad in Montreal and Quebec, Duchesneau recommends that all those who deride him to look at their own backyard.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">You're in this season with PSG notched a completely new momentum.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this development?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other, or an entirely new dimension PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">They came to us in the big leagues.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day will get further beside them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical team helped me a lot, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every day I allow these facts to enhance the level of the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it is easier in wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything's going very fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">Neztrácím but his head.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my beginnings in prep school in INF Clairefontaine after crossing into Saint-Etienne, I have always pushed for each grade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Using the competitive environment, therefore, which led Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reinforcements from this summer are accustomed to playing games at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every workout is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it follows that a player like me then has more flavor in the match, and he wants to give the maximum power.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti in connection with my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">To his assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And Ancelotti's decisive word at the right time?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today is not equal in the first league and is among Europe's best coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has vast experience and the top teams won a lot of titles.</seg>
<seg id="24">He also worked with excellent players.</seg>
<seg id="25">For me to win more titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, it is comforting conversation I had with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I've had a number of injuries behind him.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust, which gives me, is another reason of my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How are you looking at the first part of the season for PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league to us Lyon took the leading position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But remain in tow.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Champions League is one of our main objectives: We're very easily advanced to unbelievably calm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is your club in this competition target?</seg>
<seg id="34">We'll try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be a match for the quality of the European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want to win its qualifying group ahead of Porto, in order to be able to play in retaliation unbelievably calm at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">PSG may be a great European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">The budget has already on it.</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a great European club, Paris has to make history and win titles.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not yet the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the financial side, PSG has means that this project could take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a big setback nezvítězit in 1 last season as the league?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a major disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we really want to win the league title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In last season's still missing.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had an excellent season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We collected 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Generally, with 79 points, you're a champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But another club, Montpellier, the season was even more astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="52">For this year, I don't think it will.</seg>
<seg id="53">Although the title to the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think, that we have weapons in order to defeat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what was invested here and what we have the players.</seg>
<seg id="56">It absolutely accept.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is a fact that when home beat Troyes 4-0 and still find something about us in the newspapers, so it's not very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what people from you can still want more.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is not, of course, winning 4-0 on each weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not FC Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="61">We're trying to adjust his game style.</seg>
<seg id="62">You need to build a team.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, which is already the second season neprobojoval into unbelievably calm, and he invested large sums of money, too!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Whereas invested sums could be expected that you have 15 points ahead in front of the others.</seg>
<seg id="66">Thus you insult the other clubs and the French league.</seg>
<seg id="67">The clubs Lyon and Marseille, which went too far in last season, with new PSG moved into the next phase.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how 1 League is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as though PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that it says that there is "Zlatanovi dependency."</seg>
<seg id="72">That means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful and that makes a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Because of that came here and shows that the star's first league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever we went through, has proved to be a big player, a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">On our team we respect man and the players.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he accomplished is really exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This has led others to raise their level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows the concurrent growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you experienced French representation with Euro 2012?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I wanted to play in this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately I couldn't play because of injuries as well as I'd imagined.</seg>
<seg id="84">But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I'm going to play good matches in the entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="86">And in that I had hoped since its entry into the team.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are learning lessons from what has happened in Ukraine, and now owe it to ourselves, to our behavior has been exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What you're looking for the first month Didier Deschampse at the forefront of the national team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The results speak for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">In the qualification for Ms we're in a good place.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach is strictly is close to the players, and can get excited for the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">This was Laurent Blanc, too.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't want is a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has reached his goal that we have qualified for the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope, Didier Deschamps lead our team to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">A first-place tie (1: 1) from 16 October in Spain a solid starting the match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game for us added confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">We are all fighting for the team.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before the shock in Spain I experienced such a game in his career.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanks Bitcoinu can pay and sell non-banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on identified transactions, central banks and the processing cost among the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="3">As is often true in the context of these technologies is here to feel the obvious political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Bitcoin inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), represents how virtual money (transferable, however, in dollars, the euro...), so secure transfer protocol similar BitTorrentu, which allows for the exchange of files between the pair of partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network has already been registered around 200,000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kurz bitcoinu first reached all-time highs of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, he dropped to 2 dollars, today is on the verge of about 10 dollars (an overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison to the world in exchange for real money or financial products, it is not impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on virtual finances, which came out in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin describes as "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro," and "equal to the current money."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money that is used for the procedure as "credits" in a video game that gets in the way the game or that he can buy (and sometimes even back to exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Every month but the central government controls and processes of individual communication.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoinu Depositary current account books, the controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers are all the nodes of the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How the network works?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users are, in fact, between two electronic addresses using e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">The user may, however, choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with double key encryption system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network so it can verify the legality of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key phase lies in the entry of this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">Proceeds help solve mathematical task zadaného computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is about the cutting stage set, i.e. the transformation of a giant set on shorter and unique digital print.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computer "hits" this new transaction and add to her number, then the whole "chop."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find a number, which provides specific print a lot of zeros (at the start).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as he finds this number, the other nodes to check its accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is indestructible display connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have changed the impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wants to pay for the purpose of fraud twice the same money very quickly behind (in ten minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, which will resolve the challenge, bitcoinů 50 wins.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration on a regular basis is divided in two, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited the number of 21 million, however, they can share to stomilióntinu, so there is room for margin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty in negotiating the task is also increased with increasing levels of the calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network has had its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The website, which for Bitcoin provide services, were attacked and alienation has imposed bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="35">"used crack is not related to the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, real money payments for the company, which uses a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering because of this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the problem is also true for cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like the platform WordPress blogs, is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="40">ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron z Weizmannova Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book current accounts and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">"big discounts" had been launched in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It changed thirty thousand dollars," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul dealing with a turnaround bitcoinů into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also the author pedagogical books relating to this money, he has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but uses the Bitcoin system for verification of the transactions, which are cheaper because of it.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, the bearer manages its identity and so can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easily set by traders, where there is no need to install new devices or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">You just have to disclose the address, which is on the phone "ofotografovat and recognize," explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and a transition to more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In addition, the ECB in its report implies a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money will be a success.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hard work on the Egyptian constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Muhammad Mursí turned to another game of poker.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains the most in its history divided over the publication of the Constitution, which grants him temporarily unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday announced the next day regardless of the opinion of all the others that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week earlier by the head of state of this meeting in the next two months to complete the necessary work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt already uses almost two years the makeshift text, which was supplemented many times, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to a legal argument.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative will only further strengthen the country's ambivalence.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the perspective of the opposition the president stays in his "autocratic delirium," to "violates his word" and "tramples on the right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His supporters, however, assure that this is a means to deal with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, and to speed up the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">There should be a referendum in two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short time, which forces the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention to clarify the text to the Egyptians article by article.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also a way for the president to achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country batter protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly Time, Muhammad Mursí appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or keep the unlimited powers," which would otherwise should end after the approval of the new constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of the Constituent Assembly approved the text with a large majority of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of Liberals in the vote was missing.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the proclamation of the constitution, bouchli door with the fact that they do not have the option to impose their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Defenders of human rights, of civil society or religious minorities in their stride.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, yesterday morning was quickly followed by 11 people from among the replacements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators are also suspended over the fact that the day was one of the few disputes revolved around the clock... for a prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the clock in the conference room are not properly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text that was put to the vote yesterday evening, is composed of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The subject of widespread attention, Article 2, remains, in the end, identical to the version and the 1971 constitution provides that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the primary requirements, hoping that he will be replaced by the term "principles" Marriage "rule," which would allow stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The fact that this article has not been repaired for the Islamists, is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy," argued the liberals, who see it as just a problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Focusing particularly on Article 220 that al-Azhar University conferred an advisory role, especially on the issue of control of the conformity of laws with sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disturbing, because "people are not competent to comment chosen and do not have any democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">One can see the beginnings of theocracy in it. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact that the next president of the university should be less moderate than the existing fuels fears of even more.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For the moment, the result has not shown any particular religion.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution remains Egypt framed by the state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but the university staff, many of them trained in French schools, "Alexis Blouet moderates concern, which is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, agrees with the fact that "there may be differences over the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belongs to the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">In particular, the reference to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, cf note] is here.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the question to what extent they are civilian judges have to be able to express "may emerge in the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday approved the text is very criticized because of the extended powers, which is given by the President of the Republic, in addition to the religious sites.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that their significant limitations as opposed to the former regime had occurred.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: The powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of military leaders not to carry out the verification of the budget for the defense of the parliament, but the National Council of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Then the proceedings with civilians, as demanded by the association for the protection of human rights are not prohibited in military courts</seg>
<seg id="44">These associations speaks to them in connection with the text, which is directed against freedom of its misgivings.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult remains banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, no article does not deal with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová from the Human Rights Watch organisation.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point is the ban on torture set out in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president was speaking last night in a televised speech, rallies are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the heads of state will demonstrate Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="2">While members and human rights activists are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, in a country already discovered fraudsters who sell the certificates "counterfeit"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities arrive each year 13 million foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families back home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The law came into force on 1 December, under which each migrant workers will be required to pass the test of knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle, and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">FMS promises, however, that over time, the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the test will consist of the bases of law and not only in language skills, but also in Russian history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will also be necessary to attest to the extension and obtaining a work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where the official language is Russian.</seg>
<seg id="12">This law are not people who are successfully achieved the attestation and obtain academic degree by the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits, the conviction and the protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network test sites will work under the auspices of The Institute of the University of the friendship between the peoples of the Russian language, Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The migrants may consist of tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers in Russia is already open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to support the introduction of testing support as well as members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, human rights defenders could ask many times in the press, the question is: What it really will bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, with the representatives of the migration service, allowing it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of "slave labour."</seg>
<seg id="20">Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the Chairman of the Board of Directors FMS Russia's Viktor Sebelev in Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be launched before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only 90% of the system will allow organized recruitment to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise in the case of the emigrants without education, without the profession, who do not know the language and they don't have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the knowledge of the language - says with conviction Sebelev - the future migrant is convicted of clashes with unfair to people who will ensure a "voucher" under the pretext of aid ghastly, cramped quarters, in which dozens of others, like himself, and he will suffer for months without food and documents and work for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our own migrant workers receive many complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In their own country they promise one thing, but after the arrival of a lover, confiscate their passports, paid the promised salary," confirms the Key Manager Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Nenadávejte!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, intending to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only do not know the language of the country into which they want to go, but they don't have the experience, even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not so much their fault, as more misery: Very few Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmen can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families are in need of something to feed the kids, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, equip and fit into the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children mature into productive age, has to go to work at the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is hard to acknowledge - without the knowledge of the language.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Feeling the humiliation and inferior."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that, having regard to the law on language tests suggested one important thing for human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="35">The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If they do not have him, so they did not pass the examinations, nor any other official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers live in the same way as before in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or Nepovolaným forbidden"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the workers claims that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - all the language difficulties and bureaucratic obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, legalization cost money: From 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the false registration may be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Russian police employees know that we have, in fact, false documents, without authorization, and implied blackmail cases.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Vyžadují a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov shared with reporters about their experiences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, don't be stingy, buy the painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the validity of the law on the tongue, it was found that not only the documents for registration of migrants are false.</seg>
<seg id="47">FMS employees already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the test.</seg>
<seg id="48">The counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners were free: Each of migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with undergoing tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times more than the passing of an official test: The three thousand roubles will become migrant workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task now is to secure the system against corruption, so workers could simply buy the documents, in the near future agree that government officials and human rights defenders</seg>
<seg id="52">Government authorities meanwhile can promise that foreign workers who failed tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed a course of the bases of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="53">For visitors who can't speak Russian, is expected to work in areas that do not require the active negotiations with the people.</seg>

<seg id="18">The first of them - "military or military path," it means the weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Weapons stole and Russian officers and Kavkazané themselves," says Baraněc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The other type of "black" weapons are weapons stolen by criminals by the leaders of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that they belong here and the theft of weapons stolen directly from the staff of law enforcement authorities and from police warehouses.</seg>

<seg id="26">"We currently have private armaments companies, which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons to deliver on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of "black market" is the smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Separately vending machines as well as a large number of guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There's a mafia, which organized their continuous production, and their production, sometimes with weapons produced in small-scale production here," explains the former soldier.</seg>

<seg id="30">Where's the gun?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The things, what is the approximate percentage of the various sources of supply of illegal weapons experts to the "black" market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this issue wrote in 2011 center design and analysis of the problems of the public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists dismantled the statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistics, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals aimed at theme of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, state investigators, comes from the military and the executive.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all the arms left on the black market "because officials, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data available to researchers, from 17% of the cases resulted in the theft of weapons in their production of weapons from armed conflicts, in 14%, 5% is "black archaeology."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The salesman-one of the weapons business consultant, who asked not to confuse his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the "black sites" for a long time, no one is buying - archaeologists are simply too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most often, he says, sellers to drive for the new shipments directly into the military depots.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the US strike fastfoodů personnel and supermarkets</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Work on the cash establishments, "McDonald's" through to a quarter of all American teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, in America, raised a wave of protests against low wages in the company of Wal-Mart hypermarkets and in restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, "" Burger King, "" Taco Bell, "" Wendy's "and" Kentucky Fried Chicken. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave is transformed into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The trade unions and a number of leftist social organizations support the entire share.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to a modest increase for the salaries they receive rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and in fast-food systems, the organizers of the protests aim is to achieve the creation in them in their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This economic sector is currently virtually untouched odborářským movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday" when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, was accompanied by millions, and in some cases even brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day the company some workers at Wal-Mart, which works in the world of 2.2 million people abandoned their workplaces and demonstrated, together with the trade unions and left-wing activists of the multinationals, chain stores, whose goods is addressed to the people of the poor and middle class.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Wal-Mart sells everything from diapers through hunting rifles and automotive batteries around the world after a vacuum cleaner, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores are, on average, about 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">So many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only with him at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and variety of goods made from a chain of Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of critics Wal-Mart can afford to sell goods as cheaply partly because few pay their employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trucks or small scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">The typical worker Wal-Mart gets $9.5 per hour, but that does not correspond to the height of the expenses, staff members say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is more than the company spends on salaries by an average of 1.1% now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company moves Wal-Mart wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit at the store will be only about 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as customers spend about 12,39 dollars more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Walmart's defenders point out that a protest was held only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday," in stores, the company said Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the following day, and during that period the company Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, nearly 100 million transactions carried out in "Black Friday" in its coffers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with left-focused on the Huffington Post website that posts have left a total of "less than five" of Wal-Mart employees, and that the protest was "the next media sensation," organized by labor unions all told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"vacant Treasury!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests have continued this week in New York City, where their aim was not trading houses Walmart (you in that pokrokovém town not too far in favor, and therefore there are almost), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says sells billion servings, and then you even paid sick and not properly you for your hard work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fastfoodové restaurant that wage gradually increase, but only slightly, and, on average, receive their rank-and-file workers in New York City 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city, no one does not have lower wages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well I don't see how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employment at the "McDonald's" almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter goes after school on a part-time basis and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">At the present time, "McDonald" continues to meet in an interview with the workers, who complain that they must live out of the money, and some of them even to feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand hanging on the Wall Street Journal commentary, of which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning, "McDonald's" at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, on Thursday demanded that cooks and cashiers in fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 an hour, which is more than double their current minimum wages.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that the trade unions have been based in the sphere of fast food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. laws prohibit the administration to punish the activists of the trade union movement of bullying and layoffs, and to prevent the formation of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other side of their administration rarely makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">Introduced in fast-food companies, trade unions, however, it is difficult even for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is unusually high employee turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Opposition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On this day were held noisy protests as well as in a number of other low-cost restaurant in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of that action was a noon rally at the "McDonald's" had emerged near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, in particular, the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's," says sells billion servings, and then you even paid sick and not properly you for your hard work! "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators came to aid as well as other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity, everyone deserves a New Yorker!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">It was the largest event of its kind in the history of America's sphere of fast food, as described by the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="50">But only a few hundred people would take part in it, although not all of them were employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is so far unclear whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"It's the brain to deceive an average"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Between the fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of widespread reality; lately it means to view the world through the prism of special glasses in particular.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the year at its annual conference demonstrated a working model of this news, Google announced in November that Microsoft also filed an application for the patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In an interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that for the company's scientists, the glasses are a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lure is the prospect of the handling of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual of public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Tell us please framed, what is your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- Zabýváme with human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on the flat screen, most ever touches the screen with a finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate a significant change in the interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Xbox console and the Kinect sensor, for example -- it is a step forward, and almost no Xbox Kinect sensors, because there is a very interesting opportunity for all without gestural management today is not for sale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What is still ahead of us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that the Kinect system shifted the interaction on a physical level, very many interactions is still pending on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The larger quantities of data by (system), but output improved the flow of information flow particularly so far.</seg>
<seg id="14">We're trying to change this, we are working on is really three-dimensional displays systems based on various technologies including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">It should be admitted into our physical world of the computer world, make him reálnějším.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we can add to the real world to the virtual objects in much better shape.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell with those silly helmets of virtual reality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about the vocal control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It's a popular thing, but the nepřeceňuje?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Sure, he cannot be regarded as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places we had such a project in which we think about the gestures, but not about the sweeping, only a very short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gesture would nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of the muscles and bones.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yet it is big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, is that the future has mixed type of control, for example, a gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How's that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- How do I ask, for example, to give you this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say it, and at the same time, show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">I usually just talking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So you want to get users to adjust to what can or cannot, at the moment the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is not necessary at all, but it's mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can detect more precisely the reaction of a man.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be a distinction of laser scanners, for example, which provide a relatively good depth, this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you talk about his work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands on the modern camera?</seg>
<seg id="37">Today is not sufficient detail, depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In essence, the current generation - that's what we can be reflected in our work on three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be a good idea to raise the speed of 1,000 f / 8 megapixels.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not only about the megapixels, but as the depth and nuts.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the sight of the thing all current technologies are inadequate for us - that the trouble work designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y axes, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">So the number of frames per second, the speed is also very important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The move is a dynamic and present the data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made contact sensor with an adjustable delay processing of 1 to 100 ms in length, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how much it affects human interaction with the machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, it was very useful in the work of the equivalent of such equipment, but I don't need that much touching, but I need some images per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In the Kinect system are now used three "camera," one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and receiver of reflected signal - the second.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera - that is, in fact, a visible sensor zone.</seg>
<seg id="51">These are used to determine the depth of the building.</seg>
<seg id="52">A greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worsen it, because it would increase the volume needed to be carried out of the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be good to create flexible analog system Kinect, play the curvature of the position of cameras and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional positioning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) neprezentoval publicly his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You don't think in terms of the day-to-day use of the technology of the enlarged reality with the help of the special glasses, is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course walk and constantly keep smatphone in uplifted hands is not very comfortable, but I think, the strongest option would be "portable" version of the spread of reality, which would be based on the platform clouds switch at any time of the smartphone, the projection display and further round glasses.</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses - this is a very personal equipment, and in that is their strength (see you), a private matter, and at the same time, as well as weakness - augmented reality on the basis of his glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is available only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one issue on which critics often point: There is no tactile response!</seg>
<seg id="61">His hand feels nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers prepares your group to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In their lectures often say augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between human and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think it would be complete sensation could become the eighth breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">Yet one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand is used as a kind of a basis for display.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excellent records depression!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also these technologies, which are really focused on adding the appearance of solidity "picture in the air" - for example, interference few directional ultrasonic beams at the point where the finger is defined, raises the tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on the balls of the feet.</seg>
<seg id="68">Also available is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects nerve endings in his fingers -- a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">-- Have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">What seems to think that he feels it should feel at the moment when they see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- It is a good idea, that we haven't tried yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">There is another challenge that he will fight for a long time - how to get a man who are physically located in a cramped space to believe that an open virtually infinite space walks - are also on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all, such as in clubs), a moving platform, as well as the huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes a goal, it's still work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what makes the work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things is in the very beginning.</seg>

<seg id="11">- Cyril, why you walk around the city all in red and yellow or not, for example, in turquoise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose the color red as a designer engaged in view and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although as a general rule that everything is just a little different from the gray, incites aggression and stirs bad characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are focused on it, so that the conversation was made.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole story of my provocative acts is first and foremost an invitation to debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">- And when you understand that you have to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- On the exhibition at the House of Culture at Něvském, where they were exposed to my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understand what is my path.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then came a wave of unofficial artists of the old and the new, liberal types of artists, I couldn't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I was friends with a new wave of artists, with the post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the waves were "puškinské 10," and others.</seg>
<seg id="22">This brings me to the theater, dressing in all genres of music, except for the words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- And it all to combine in your art-clinic. - For me it was important to be at the center of the culture of the Petersburg, where should gather all the best forces creativity.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995 I took place on puškinské 10, and there still existed before reconstruction musically-art club, arty club, home petěrburkské Bohemians.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was much: Nome, tequila Jazz, remember how Šnura the Ears "Van Gogh" was brought to the project.</seg>
<seg id="26">Be and his friends sang under decking light songs, dressed in tight trikotů, among them in the middle of the composer Igor the dowager's, who is now in vogue.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the band began to play live, became "Leningrad."</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg led many programmes sworn-galivských times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtěnberga, started by his great career, basic education and training received from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">The gallery "D 137," club "Gribojedov - it is the aftermath of the Art Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">This left our workers and patrons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I'm a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000 was structured survey was in the press, the special prize was "People in our city."</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination, "the Artist of the Year." I was appointed, it ended my peak.</seg>
<seg id="35">In recent times, according to the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is easy to become popular in recent years, but the popularity and the culture are different things today, you may be popular, but not too much cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works are characterized by a recognisable manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Many of my paintings - they are hits, in which is vividly captured the pervasiveness and timeliness.</seg>
<seg id="39">I have a program of the exhibition "of the Russian Museum in klaunech."</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless categories.</seg>
<seg id="41">Before I used to be social, today it is painful and awful.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the klaunech everything collapses, scanning the tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love grotesque, I get the grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, to save the world by totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today, people are under clothing, focusing on the mechanics, not on the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or maybe it should be spit in his face and his arm cannot be made.</seg>
<seg id="47">The trick will be removed and change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Recently we have seen you in the role of the urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">And who it should be, if not me?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- A commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- At present their utility, commercial art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">It leads to the collapse of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="53">Previously, people gathered in groups, Strauss loved one, free from other people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today everything was broken at mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I'm not stodolarová bill, I liked all of them.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today, it should be thinking, whom the zalíbíte.</seg>
<seg id="57">Today everybody has a cultural hero of 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- And on Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- On his groupies come, there were sexually involved in the social sphere.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it comes down to the cultural ground 300 people and 10,000 of them will come, and the consequence is less of the management of the money, all languish.</seg>
<seg id="61">I can't fool the fans, the main thing is that there is no one and violates what is ingrained.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I was painting such pictures hung on the wall along with Falkem and Larionovem at one collector.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the images that people often ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, people often mistaken concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say: The consumer culture, the culture minister.</seg>
<seg id="66">There's no consumer culture, it's from somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture of the previous day, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money because of drawing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">And I'm for such a culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Clive, what is a shortage in Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- A good experts on culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is no such concept: The Churchman through the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all of them may deal with the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">In ordinary times carů that it wasn't in all the Czars understood that the real experts should be encouraged, but perhaps too did not understand the culture.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow today are good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">For us we have people who could be experts in St. Petersburg, but they are zastrčení somewhere in a corner, because the big experts are needed, who rightly appreciate these experts and state is on the right path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Today prospers vkusovština.</seg>
<seg id="77">The Erarta, but differ in that honestly say that not everything we are adopting modern art, there are artists who would have to look for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is your Petěrburk?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petěrburk - that's not the main city of culture, the culture is much more in Moscow, there is the right soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our fallow art are doing poorly.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural ground, but for us it is today more than readers, writers, this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">It's a great many people in Europe, who are curious, who like to go to concerts, exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="83">For us, this layer is very weak.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need art to become a fashion issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="85">The project is being implemented under the grant funds St.Petěrburku</seg>

<seg id="39">The female body is the most precious thing that humanity has.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Chaika flew and nobody on Earth could not say whether it would hold a flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether he can do after such a flight to give birth to a child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"We have no answer to that question," says the veteran of the space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The child's father was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988 he was born the son of a second woman-kosmonautce Savické Svetlana, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only a few astronauts, who were born after long years and growing health descendants.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And that can be dangerous even when the orbital flights," says the pilot-astronaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Yet humanity must inevitably explore new avenues in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a stage of preparation for flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in zero gravity conditions astronauts embrace the habits necessary to work in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water imitating weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Though the water is even comfortable for adults, but in its own way, a strange environment for young children is a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between that the child is at an average of nine months in his mother's amniotic water and then that is easier to get to the water for them.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing expire only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It's very little for a child to have forgotten," says Marina Aksenovová swimming instructor of newborns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In a nutshell - if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness more natural state, then the inevitable gravity, the attraction is more natural for women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the weightlessness occurs very quickly to the pelvic muscles, the abdominal muscles, dropping the body's ability to expel the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">We can leave aside if they work promoters of muscle activity in childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the body of the mother should be expelled the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And what further?" asks Valeri Polyakov complex issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If the organism gravity, the skeleton does not form properly, or a set of muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn into orbit, it is not possible to wear the burden as an adult in a suit in which he could coach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just be deprived of what his development needs unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="67">"If you go into an experiment, which allows the birth of the child in a foreign environment, bring a disabled person on Earth, which will be completely nepřizpůsobená political environment," predicts the Head of the Commission on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So having children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">But once the time comes when it becomes a reality, and when the Earthlings issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The boss of an OWL: Check švarcsystému failed because of politicians'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has good controllers in connection with public procurement and the quality of the legislation, but in its application is lagging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview for Aktuálně.cz. says that the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what's missing in my view for us," says the current situation, Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar conclusions also suggests the joint control of the Czech and German controllers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practice says Petr Nečas access to a so-called "švarcsystému."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother the trader's controls - is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be set in some way, and if something forbids, so neither can prevent the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce obligations," Kala notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, under which was compared the legislation on public procurement contracts in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was going on?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">A parallel check we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement contracts, followed by the various national legislations and then also the experience itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We put all this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, we have shown very interesting differences - generally speaking the legislation is with us, perhaps, "stricter and more sophisticated," the practice itself, however, is better in some parameters in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This is, therefore, that it is not enough to create more precise rules went on and on, but it is the need to pursue the application of the law itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">For what you actually can help this project, what follows from him for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is such a common check could contribute to stop efforts to refining laws, the reduction and improved levels, though it does not have such a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (which is not always the lowest price), in order to avoid the enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by lowering the limit of the contracts, it does not necessarily achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may be that the system is overwhelmed, "the paper" in a quantity that those who wish to find holes in the system, so you will benefit from this much simpler than if the limit was higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You're talking about domestic problems with passing legislation on public procurement into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How the control system works in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there an OWL office like ours, or is it otherwise set?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the authorities, as well as the OWLs Bundesrechnungshof works, which is organized like us, there is also a college, but they are in some other way, but, in principle, both authorities doing likewise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The powers are also similar to a certain extent, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal structure, that is to the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - in that the system is a bit different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can only control of the federal money, we posed by public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds, which are managed by the county, the municipalities with us, they control from the level of the federal courts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the legislation, so it is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I would do it without specific data comparing, however, in some respects, Germany cannot be described as a model, but I'm sure to say that he is better at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is, therefore, perhaps because they have better controllers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to say that even countries, which we consider to be a model, faced with a wide range of issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">If there was any benefit for them to cooperate with our office, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As regards the domestic legislation, what the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant to your office, showing the kind of its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Whereas the validity of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control actions shows.</seg>
<seg id="35">The ex-post checks because we do, there is a need to count on some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We see it only in the process of preparing the future checks - we started our new tool "inefficiencies risk detection," through which we run almost 14,000 public procurement contracts, and we've analyzed them - there are those changes, of course, will show, because the limits change, the conditions of certain types of the selection procedure shall be adjusted and things like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The approval of this law, therefore, is likely to benefit, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope to confirm it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem here may be that she "tighten" the rules, and it will not be possible to follow them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the previous rules are controlled by the person obliged by the provider (as in the case of the regional operational programmes regional council) to ensure that any failure of the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">So the price is tightening the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I don't think so in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, and not to punish those who are guilty of formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system would only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how much is out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Show which way is not the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother entrepreneurs controls the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law forbids must surely be set in some way, and if anything, then, neither can prevent the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It may say: "Změníme that law and we allow it," but you cannot say that we are going to do anything like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented - which is right, in order to protect the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic, as the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what's missing in my view for us.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with the band The Tap Tap fun of what we are doing more and we say that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy in order to delay the end of the world, or prevent him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December, moreover, convening absolutely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you imagine him closer to readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a national fundraiser, which we are planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before December 20 from 21 hours in parallel with three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally it was probably my idea, then we were all together with our artist John Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we are also together with the public think about the condition of one of the world we bequeath to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at www.e-tap.cz us humans can also support.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are working as well as with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, whereas we do a lot of charity events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We're trying to do is heavily involved in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The proceeds from the concerts will go against the end of the world for what?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The cost of equipment bezbariérového educational centers Studeo, already the sixth year we s občanským sdružením Tap in Jedličkově Institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">For school students Jedličkova Institute regularly attend teachers and engaged in activities that they enjoy it and are interested in.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the funds to be released for Teachers themselves, we are allowed to do so in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the Constitution Events Jedličkova arises in the future in a separate building, which will move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert will several musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">How did you pick them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to draw up a program that appeals to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango, Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">All details will learn to www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are you planning any similar "bombastic action" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we will prepare for the first time to appear at the Prague Spring, so there must be an interesting programme is interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we're in the US, I would like to link it with a speech in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are minimal, yet you've climbed in Brussels, London, Madrid or Moscow, for example.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group comprising disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">How to manage these voyages operationally and logistically?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as bad as it first appears.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members in an electric wheelchair, its trucks must travel in the luggage compartment, further along, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, it was always handled without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways to us were well prepared, I wondered at times when.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, that was no problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks výjezdům abroad can compare how individual vary in bezbariérovosti, public access to reasonably priced applications and the like.</seg>
<seg id="46">With what you have not yet met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After London, Luxembourg, Madrid and other places where everything works better than for us, we have just witnessed in Russia, in the east, everything is still in the complete starts.</seg>
<seg id="48">In Prague, Moscow is very barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric wheelchair himself was at the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">Is there even such commonplaces like that should be wheelchair give priority in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately there even have a civic association, which is trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There's a lot of things, in which we are still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that upgrades and improvements in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London, in Madrid, it is quite normal that even people with severe achievement of self are in public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is very normal that there would not be a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in social life, in that we, on the other hand, with a little bit of The Tap Tap ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect of the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when we are prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things are going to change the real thing.</seg>
<seg id="57">Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The band The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but a few years back what made you in 1998 to begin her?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I climbed into the Jedličkova Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people who had an interest in something like a tutor to pay.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I'm a musician himself, playing the saxophone, among others, so I, together with my colleague founded extracurricular musical circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">And with the passage of time will tell us, as our host Láďa Angelovič says, a little out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But the popularity came up in the last few years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us when we began to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">It occurred to us that work, which is not seen as if in fact did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Your goal was to go to The Tap Tap so high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt the potential of the fact that we can do something different.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness's crowded things where one imitating the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is, in a way, logical, all new is taken up by carefully, and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">The things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that the Tap Tap are one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, is, of course, regret, it is only natural.</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with no achievement in all the lonely beings that we must regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are the people who can live a full life, and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if something happens to people with achievement, so it is not only a shift for them, but for society as a whole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">It will also help this success, you are a hard taskmaster, how many people call you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do a good job, we must be uncompromising in many cases, and require some discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think it's perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when they find that they must go to the test twice a week, attend the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm is so quickly leave.</seg>
<seg id="79">This is how it works everywhere, in every group, which wants to work and that he wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We open the group, people come and go, you can't avoid it.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and appetite, has always been an open door for us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Place the day before the end of the world, is expected on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week was adopted at a meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency in Poland for the twentieth of a member of the European Space Agency, as the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which will become a full member of the ESA 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched a close working relationship with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of the projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Poland's path to space began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The number of flights into space devoted to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War, but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Recall, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which represented the thoughts of his pioneering work on December 6, 1933 Entry into space.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (b) 1905) left audiences cold and after years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld in 1934 won for Entry into space in France worth of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and Andre Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wrote a number of books and hundreds of articles published in Polish magazines devoted to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became the world-known promoter of spaceflight and his contribution was valued by the fact that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already rolling trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland in 1925.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known, and even the details of the project are not known.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for the ground trolley or to its application.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about the handcar are known only from dobového press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933, the rocket shells began to deal with the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of the surviving materials, it is clear that the research came to the stage prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the research was interrupted by the arrival of German troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 proposal appeared in specialized printing photovoltaic interceptor missiles, which suggested the engineer Rohoziński and came out in the following year work Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all projects devoted to military use of rocket technology Temporary the Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) to coordinate all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but the start of the war ended after two years of its business activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further work is dedicated to space after the war, thanks to the work of the company's astronaut of Poland (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) are appearing in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time the company is mentioned in the November edition vintage 1954 problemy magazine, in which four more comprehensive sections are devoted to astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, is designed to create a society that will deal with the space.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time was running projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the year 1956 the Polish company astronautická (PTA) snažia astronaut to join the International Federation (1951) and already established in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the following year, with the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became vice-president of the International Federation of astronaut.</seg>
<seg id="30">This function held until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the PTA contributed significantly to the development of a very successful weather rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket that carried out by scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with were able to reach 1,800 meters was about 80 cm long, and it weighs less than 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and flight tests of two instances in the Bledovské desert RM-2 rockets have been launched in the summer of 1959.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 inches long, and it weighs about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another development type already should be capable of real scientific work - a rocket RM-34 should be available to 14.5 km and its mission was the height of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the further development was suspended in 1962.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The Heir missile Meteor-1 became the first rockets of the type of RM developed from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was designed as a double, its overall length was 510 cm and takeoff weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">The size of the space for scientific instruments were developed three types of (marked "Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), that was different.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Meteor-1A rocket was available space on the volume of 0.4 liter, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum altitude in all three types was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 took place in the development of missile Meteor-2, Leteckém Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Meteor missile-2 was starting weight 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently, versions of the Meteor-3 and Meteor-2H were built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">There is still a need to mention Poland's entry into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also in the framework of the programme Intercosmos engaged in space research on Soviet-made satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second after Vladimir Remek interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution has sparked a lively debate in public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalized world, they are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems are in permanent conflict between them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause is the principle of free trade and unrestrained, free movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of the considerable differences prices work (wage) leads to the tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in the competition that "trip" price competitor with the aim of tearing down to shoulder a greater share of the market and thus to increase their profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or they buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in the countries where labor costs are high in comparison with other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility, and thus the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising social spending in the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation underscores the reluctance of businesses to pay taxes and that economic and social society of the damage that was done in pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so widely known that there is no need to specify the particular statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies will create a situation where governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce social level of their own populations with the aim to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the government's private equity risk his own population regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is primarily manifested in amendments to existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is the force of its own population adopted the diktat of private capital, particularly in the areas of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is happening, on the other hand, a set of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand, limiting the rights of workers in the field of employment law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are already a number of years of public lander of food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people is already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that, properly employed people receive a salary that the state must pay them into the breadline.</seg>
<seg id="23">That scandal was published in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures virtually all of southern EU states clearly lead to the same situation, in which people are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of the social level forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or scrape for starvation wages on the fringes of society into the country in the hope that he might someday private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here is necessary, but ask where it comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or a Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the wages of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="27">That applies to the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and media ad nauseam contends that the state cannot attend to its own economy, capital-that-driven economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private equity stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state should not interfere with the management interventions in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then it is necessary to ask whether private equity does not intervene, now, in fact, be governed by the politics and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is a clear-cut answer yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation as reflected in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefit, legislation, where practically everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for the lack of financial means private law firms outsource the drafting of laws, which are often in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All this power comes from the people as they preach the constitution of the western type, but of the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly get into a situation as it describes Appiános in his work of the Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "Stop the obsazovaly of violence was in full decay and the authorities for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="38">For bribes, illegal acquisition of affection and using stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any inhibitions and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice... "" men of character to the office at all neucházeli, so once was as a result of the breakdown was the state eight months without consuls "...." It is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only cure is in a bad situation samovláda and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man.. "Appiános while thinking Pompeia, but it became Caesar, who changed to take democracy for tyranny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Conclusion Like in antice reckless preference of contemporary society is based on its own interests without regard to society's interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is not inherently able to understand and to society's benefit.</seg>
<seg id="42">Now, as then, is the result of unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform a deeper flavor.</seg>
<seg id="43">Causality boarding fascist and communist regimes we must therefore found in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current situation the demise of these systems in favour of the type of liberal democracy can be regarded as a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact that the current elite is particularly disastrous completely ignored in the future be statisícové casualties, humanitarian and social disaster, which we've already witnessed with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the competition on both international and Interior European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to find ways to further reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen the state capital participation in the economy will strengthen the influence of citizens in the government, and will weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="6">I don't want to wonder who is in periodically recurring waves of killing the culprit and the victim who, after all, the people of Israel today, including self-governing territories were born into the current political situation and the beginning of the violence seen.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact of the matter to offer readers look behind the curtain to look at it, who primarily serves for 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the country in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my thoughts are backed up by historical facts available some are derived from them on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of mankind is a history of the struggle for power in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every era can be traced some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personalities, which completely autonomously governed by their actions, or whether someone who stood behind the throne of directing their actions to advance vytýčenému goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have to admit that we live in a time when the world is zkoncentrováno wealth in the hands of a few and that this concentration of money and power resulting from them could occur in the life of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among these astronomically rich families out of one, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I) - Rothschieldové, but I don't know if anyone is still standing over them.</seg>
<seg id="14">He writes about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) bought back in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop associating their names with highly criminal deeds, stood in the background, and that's always meant the consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">With shares in almost all of the world's central banks and against countries where they don't have shares in the central bank's lead or preparing a war (against an attack in Afghanistan was that it was 5-7 countries, after invading Iraq, countries, only four remained after the overthrow of Gaddafi, but in the meantime, Russia had been subordinated to the central bank of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln Rothschieldově refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America, began to issue government (translated) of his own money during the civil war and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed 1963, an MP, was assassinated in 1936, Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned after he wanted to sue FED for starting the Great Depression in 1929.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Their desire for a global power led to the formulation of the plan in three world wars of the 33rd degree, a Mason from 1859-1871 insiders Albert Pike.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war should be to remove large monarchistické public facilities in Europe, the second was removing the colonial mansion in Great Britain and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (such a large number of slaves for their comfort and luxury enough and do not consume too many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a final takeover of absolute power and fertile ground for such a solution).</seg>
<seg id="23">The method, which the group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and subsequent offering solutions (order ab chaos - order out of the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">But these solutions are false and lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, in order to avoid a crisis like the one created in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">So after managed an assassination imperial heir to the throne of R-U Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, destroyed tsarist Russia launch the Bolshevik Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended sudden, militarily and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (no longer need a war for the destruction of Czarist Russia), and subsequently led to the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria, Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">To facilitate the emergence of World War II left bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation that imposed on Germany's huge war reparations, which had created the radicalization of the impoverished masses and then they just slip sufficiently strong to the Germans, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering Leader and the creation of multi-ethnicity in Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play as fifth columnists and played too, sparking a fire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century prompted Rothschieldové preferential in the historic area of Judea, the founding of the Zionist movement, of which one branch to seek the creation of the Jewish state with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">Already mentioned Balfourova Declaration has created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, began the first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, if Hitler was plucked from the chain, which it initially held international bankers, or what was in the plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp has created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and was just as war reparations Germany to invite the 2.světovou war, the declaration of the state of Israel was created an outbreak of war in the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish nation, like the other, of the victims will be in the front line of the fighting, now jointly with an Arab or a Muslim population of the Middle East in general.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only within the country, but also on an international scale (consider just how sharply divided the people of Israel's supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence when he stood at the beginning of all the greed of individuals and their desire for a global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There is a need to make a distinction between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because people like us, international bankers peddled only candidates of their own choice in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example fašizujícího, loyal to international bankers, a politician who makes every effort to trigger a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and given control over Iran moving through the strait, which travels 20% of all of the world's oil (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">In light of what is now appears to be the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and the people will agree to a new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">A new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">The rest of the world, where the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.</seg>

<seg id="5">The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, but has been unable to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened fiasco attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The detention of the diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their plight triggered a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment at home.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran contributed considerably to Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck, Argo describes an episode in the history of America, which brought a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just prior to the occupation of the embassy have fled her six employees.</seg>

<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, helped so extravagant a cover story - went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who surveyed the location for the filming of the country's sci-fi epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the "expert exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to be credible, the legend said the film project in the specialist magazine, held a press conference, a production company she had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez, a long period of time, the details of the operation were classified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck film is a strange combination of multiple genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called 'right movie, "the story of the height of the piece, scam - can be seen as an example of a series of Danny's teammates.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film's change of mood - on the one hand dokumentárně designed sequence from Tehran (in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické period photographs of the events and the way in which the same situation were mentioned in the film - big differences in that they are not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -muži in suits analyses of the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleckovi is remarkable in the way managed to restart his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">The actor had become an object of mockery became a respected director, as well as his acting ceased to be the target of ironic comment.</seg>
<seg id="25">ARGO is his third feature film, after dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">It is also the first Affleck film, which is happening here in Boston, režisérově home.</seg>
<seg id="27">A feel for the atmosphere of the place where he was among the characteristics that warned older films place above Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck and it is also reflected in the Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the movie is taking place in the streets, when rekonstruování actual events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, who also conveys the emotion of the confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that ensue when history to move somewhere out of the blue.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes contrived (a false staff at the Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many things in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that he has told the story does not offer much in the film sense erratic scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully with it almost works, sometimes to reality, something přimyslí - there everything so elegantly based (a scene in which a potential crisis at Tehran airport will call in America and chase after the runway is pretty far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weakness Argo's restlessness arising from the need to show too many things in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood collaborators are very charming, but their characters would have meant more space and nearly all are not in this movie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleck movie sort of losing a dramatic move, it's a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation of the retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">Swings but only barely.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of one so far in a certain way of living history as well as proof of how the images of suffering and vševědoucích exaggerated the intelligence service, but will suffice.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who each year publishes polled on the absurd banking fee, has now decided to declare the competition for "absurd regulations or ideas from the workshop of the EU."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"Vedla us for this latest incident, when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the leadership of the great European companies," he told Právo survey organizer Patrick Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominated absurditami's, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unification of premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet, at the same time, the women were in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are less risky for insurance companies in an objective manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Other people can nominate incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial EU regulations include even mandatory blending biofuels into the fuel, which harm as a result of the directive on the size or nature, as well as a ban on the use of solid mercury thermometers, just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, hens cage, for which this year significantly more expensive eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Criticism also faced earlier de facto ban on the use of the expression pomazánkové butter or phase out the sale of incandescent bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">High-quality bananas have 14 inches</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The EU's camera often sits under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobbies, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (as the Czech Republic, now, as well as the threat of a veto promotes the requirements of its banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The lobby interests were also behind this, that bananas, for example, had the highest quality in the Union to achieve at least 14 cm in length and allowed show "anomalous twist."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission, meanwhile, said that only harmonises the uniform national standards, which complicate trading.</seg>
<seg id="14">EU rules on fruit and vegetables over the opposition of some states softened with reference to the fact that the existing Directive lead to food waste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">May also be a candidate for the victory in a survey last year by the EU regulation, under which it must be a warning that children younger than 8 years is not obligatory for sold balloons inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU's appeal to the U.S. research, according to which the balloons are among the leading causes of death in children's toys to suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similar restrictions are now set for children under the age of 14 when foukání carny frkaček.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Curious ideas are born at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The rule is quite absurd relating to the European officials themselves - anyone who has any official position in the EU, not with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece must talk instead about Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire nominated in polls, in addition to some of the above absurdities, even on the territory of a Member State EU regulations on the volume of food stocks.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set a maximum volume of food stocks, which could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, set the volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he threatened a high penalty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organisers polls taken as well as the idea of some countries to pay for it, that they do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies on a request to obtain subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, these ideas emerged in Brussels, but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We handicapováni that we don't have the sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ask for reimbursement from the European Union, "he said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As an argument stated that we had bred a lot of grain and as a result of the so-called intervention buying had become filled with stores, which had to be exported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the fact that the Czech Republic has continued to ports, EU had us under Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The European Commission finally came out to meet the Czech Republic by a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">The subsidy to obtain subsidies offered to municipalities controlled the Ministry for Local Development Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), namely, should go to write applications for the subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The efficient functioning of the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time, the regulation is not easy to become a target of criticism in the Member States and the development of the entire European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The major problem is according to the experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies to projects that are not even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations that will force the Member States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Emotions among Czechs raises that like other countries of the European Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to specific indications of their traditional products, and it does not always succeed in this fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czechs had after šestiletém to fight with the Germans and Austrians strike marking Olomouc cheese, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename the tuzemák.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only products made from cane distillate may bear the name of rum, and not from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the EU's official list of registered products in the company internationally renowned German Lübeck marzipan, Gorgonzola and feta cheese or Parma ham biscuits, Karlovy Vary, for example, were already Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr Žatecký chmel, too.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">I don't care about it, to be a senator or president.</seg>

<seg id="5">But I can't watch the past twenty years the country rozkrádá, as thieves run here, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't have the ambition to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that I don't like, so I try to come up with a solution, how to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I am independent and was forty nestraník, I don't have any choice, how things affect than to run for senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You got to the Senate, but then you started at the Castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The whole time I said that I go into battle on the Castle depending on the outcome in congressional elections.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I said that if I'm elected senator, I'm going to run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">But my aim is not function, function is an instrument, how can I carry out their vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not just that as a nation at in the pub and in front of the TV, but that the trampling of anyone who wants to try to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">Add to that the media that a man dehonestují and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">For me to be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's go to your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the battle of the Castle were charged with criminal liability and substantive propositions of politicians and reversing the property return over twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that you need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president but don't have the authority to do that, but the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How's it going to solve?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I lobbied for it as a citizen, to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, deliberately rejected, and people's lives.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nestraník got much greater potential to win the support from all the parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My priority is that without partisan categorization and dogmas can take something from each party, what is best for our country and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you consider yourself more as a man of the right-wing, or a left-wing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech perspective it seems to me that people enjoy me more to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it is not important at all, if a little to the left or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important for us to go forward.</seg>

<seg id="37">Anyone can call it populism, but all the proposals, I'm talking about, already leading experts in the world of work or talked about them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament, you were just slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that, in the long-term policy nevystačíte.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think when you're for people to walk and talk with them, you'll be able to push through the material and criminal responsibility, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I don't have any other choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Persuading politicians, journalists and members of the public and try to get them on your side, to promote it.</seg>
<seg id="43">I was elected president, is not a problem to organise a live broadcast television, where he is chairman of the parliamentary parties, to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they would eventually have to say why they don't want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there's a strong personality, which will be naming abuses, can push on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take direct election of the president, it was the work of public pressure.</seg>

<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people not to vote and those who were mostly elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">We're just two independents in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="59">People navolili Senate so that it will be difficult to enforce the changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">But I'm going to fight for your vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors or generals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You're considering establishing his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I thought about it, because I don't have time to check the net past each potential straníka, and neither don't have the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have no money even for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You don't have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You're talking about property returns, what is it yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Private property estimate about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague got land about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art about ten million, Aston Martin for $3.5 million and Skoda Superb per million and then I got a couple of million in the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Aston Martin by the way I have because it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was courteous to women and, at the same time, he fought against the wrongs and faults.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You got the property for $60 million, Aston Martin and you don't have the money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to amend the Republic, but you don't want to give too much of their own money into.</seg>
<seg id="71">It's not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">To get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I bumped into the campaign had 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I don't have any sponsors indicates that on my program might not be such an interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I don't have an obligation to pay a campaign of their own.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign to cover me basically what I receive senátorský salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But from him I nevyžil, for example, I could not pay for the son of an English school, which cost 30,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">I just wanted to make money, so anywhere nekandiduji.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So you will remain in business, so you can live?</seg>
<seg id="81">You said that these activities utlumíte?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But that has nothing to do with the level of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, I partially canceled their activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the travel agent to become my deputy in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like me to be the Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to earn a living.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How many of you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Two hundred to 400 thousand, which take on.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure are only in his head - for example Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books -- 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"The building looks futuristic seems cheerful. Finally is once again to see something interesting," says Verhaig Lisette, who goes around on the side of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, IT technician in nearby a large firm, says: "Of course, the house is nice."</seg>
<seg id="4">I will, however, ask what we still need a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily nobody goes, or is it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, settlements in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, that's not worth a visit, is holding a special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">This town with a population of 80 000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to resolve this silly situation, died a few years before the decision to contribute to the universal education and build seven nicely painted miniatures of fictional bridges, reinforced concrete, which are depicted on euro banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the success of the educational offensive was less than glowing.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so city councilmen recognized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: We've got to have a library.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master insanely courageous sloupcových graphs and the contractor humorous, often even cynical buildings, accepted the case with his usual calm and appeared on the competitive negotiations in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the commission was still stunned looked around and shrugged her shoulders, piling brash Maas their gifts to each other by size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear urban city!"</seg>
<seg id="14">This is my proposal on the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, she was piled a mountain for 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="16">The post office is revitalizačního parts of the project, which also include the underground parking lot, a supermarket, and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November was the mountain of books vyznamenána second place "Best Library of NL 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for an award the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maloměstská gray, who still could not offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly at the town hall, for which the white facade would rather than expected dairy, is a bit richer as a result of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">, in particular, has now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long journey to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impressions: Reading rock and roll under the hatch on the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although a mountain massif rides the elevator, but the actual space and you discover reading passion when pedestrian control topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">From all sides with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see the dog, park benches and the boys and girls who play soccer.</seg>
<seg id="27">And all the books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally standing shelves with books along the facade and is in the middle of a dark room, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We built the classical spatial configuration upside down, and the space for the reader, we ran from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly used: Offices are located in the center of the Internet, the library, the chess club, organic and center operator front techniques.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special comfort are black shelves for books that were once lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The appearance, structure, and the stench is strange.</seg>
<seg id="33">Over an unknown building material shake their heads even avowed architects and engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We have to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager for the city's municipality Spijkenisse, to question Standard magazine.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years the fields and greenhouses in the Netherlands is used as a basis under the roots of a millimetre fleece of synthetic material.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and time-efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">A thin textiles last one or two of the season and he is ready to trash into bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library was fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - slisováno on board about four inches thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (be) stain in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 go to the top of the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of a long journey of nearly 500 meters you will be rewarded not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus trees in pots in a literary cafe.</seg>
<seg id="43">You take care of the atmosphere, but mainly on the proper humidity in the mountains of literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I guess you wouldn't believe, but this house is a case in the project despite many areas of glass, in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.</seg>
<seg id="46">The heating and cooling the Earth's heat.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only a short time, and even on sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">Broad improved wooden trusses, which stands at right angles to a glass facade, serves as a shading and picks up a large part of the solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest will fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine to Cynthia Bogarde Boekenberg even referred to as "the long-awaited" Spijkenisse soul.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: Each of the population of the city a few weeks before he was invited to the opening that gave a book from his personal funds.</seg>
<seg id="55">Should that be filled first optical gaps not yet fully equipped with a library, currently numbering 70,000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has proved its worth.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are quite crowded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There's nothing worse than a half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think now, thanks to our invitation has each of the inhabitants of a relationship to a new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it was just for show.</seg>
<seg id="62">The MVRDV worked in the royal discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse said the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">Whatever is young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is, in the end, the starting point for an identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the decision-making process for the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa by Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle, Germany at the beginning of the week at first suggested that the Palestinians would have voted against the proposal for observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, must be prudent in Germany because of their special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I think, will not support nor the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, of course, it was too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to the establishment of a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">The last champion of NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, that's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and German foreign policy towards the direction of policy, which was controlled by the US, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is made more difficult by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are therefore between the two lines.</seg>
<seg id="18">From there, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think of is just settling in its role, but they are on the path to a more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">On foreign policy, as they are in France or in Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows a readiness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think, German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, therefore, exports and his relationships with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other major powers and, therefore, Germany must protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">To have an impact on the position of the economic interests in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Germany is the first major outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful to discourage the public, but even the elites in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I wouldn't want to do that but not to attach too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it plays an important role in the German considerations in any case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Damage Germany's relations with the US, when Germany abstained in the case of the two important decisions, for example, during the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position in Europe and even in the US.</seg>
<seg id="33">That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as a breakthrough on the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps out of Germany even get some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It signals that it must be regarded as an international player, and his interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian Initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, by contrast, clearly expressed for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has probably had a great deal of understanding for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But as a result of the political situation there cannot hold this position, of course, to the public.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think the difference of opinion is not as great as they always seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, that Obama isn't too excited Netanjahuovou policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is not difficult for Germany to harmonise their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand,?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think this just makes it to the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans, it would be a little easier, of course, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They cannot be part of a wider line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That's what they were doing with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany will push Europe to the European position and take a leading role in the future.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It has always been a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I don't think that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as an important international player? He wants to take the lead role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is a leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still used to it, it's still uncomfortable, and it is still difficult for obvious reasons for this country to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If, for example, let's look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role, gives protiněmecké mood.</seg>
<seg id="57">It will facilitate the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is, in fact, the old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a more difficult position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable to all sorts of views and its neighbors, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of the US in European politics now continues to decline, but the EU currently be this vacuum. Who's left otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they don't like it, they feel uncomfortable and makes it even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protecting brands" in China: When Armani and Puma are suddenly Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Polo Ralph Lauren, Armani is the world-famous brand as well.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is the Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind it lurks the designation, which is quite officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original firm.</seg>
<seg id="5">Enjoy protection for so long, however, until it is nezažalují real brand owners.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear whether to amass the rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protective rights violations in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">A new case each week lands on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Counterfeiters is already a few extra letters, so that they can make their own brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lu-will thus become the Gucci Gucci and Prada instead they register Prada-kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way they are legally copied and German firms, like sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a file cabinet, the records of the trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14 September 2010 had left one Chinese company to protect brand Zegna DF Puma robot project, which parazituje as the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in copying and intellectual property violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities are multistory department stores in which almost exclusively selling fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Pattlochovy cases are different. Under the authority of their principals' is totally opposed to Chinese firms received from the trademark office officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," the Associated mark.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word "Dakuan focuses on" Bang.</seg>
<seg id="19">That means women who fish for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Poškozuje this trade, we must fight it," Pattloch calls.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Call to dilute the exclusive status would disappear, the damage to the image is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The court costs of the affected industries, and financial losses running into the millions, particularly for expensive product demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data from market research company for the CLSA China with the volume of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest market for luxury goods and market that is growing as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="25">The deletion of dubious records in the record labels can be difficult to achieve, and it is something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected claims that the contested name became a reality of the market "after a long period of time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff has bad luck plagiátorovi still must pay because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements as well.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, a firm, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps on the concrete mixture.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, the Chinese still can use the emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company Geely bought Volvo, which was originally used blue and white logo that looked like BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely logo had to change.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer of the fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">While the CTMO známkový Office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of too much of a small number of staff and premises.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year, reportedly said, "the operation of the labour force returned from an emergency situation to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of unprocessed management of objections, for example, dropped by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">57 000 of these cases were closed, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints on the settlement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To do something against it is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is often the case in China, it's impressive numbers.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the last year was CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is nearly a third more than the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's a record, and it means that China for the tenth time behind leads the list of new applications in the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">It also applies to the number of all existing trade marks - a total of 5.5 million of them.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 was on the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">It simply means that each filing in the average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Start against this dispute is several times as the German case shows the family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">The group has been fighting for more than seven years against Chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans had reached that was cancelled his illegal manufacture imitovaných automotive components.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the forger had secured the rights to the brand Freudenberg continue.</seg>
<seg id="52">We're neglecting it, because in Germany cannot be protected surname, says Hanna Wentzler, chairman of the management company Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">Známkový office CTMO then, too, a Munich company rejected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the other two arenas are Freudenberg obtain the rights, but the defendant in the dispute is also fighting to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We need to be very careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">It is now a matter pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has the confidence that he would take the case to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: "Management is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs cannot be measured in the archives of the company had even over a hundred years old files to produce evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years before the company Freudenberg counterparty vainly offered "high six-figure in euros" in order to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"From this, you see, what it means for us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">It threatens to hit the danger from the Far East and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And if it's there, imitators will ensure the unprotected brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">For example, one Chinese producer wanted to make in Germany Freudenberg designation for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of the business activities of the group long ago gave up, yet he was able to avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"We need to be very careful," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and a lawyer Pattloch advises German enterprises, to be very careful in its dealings with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international rights známková. Foreigners would rather have "everything that is in any way to protect themselves even in China," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the company compete in the last act of the drama of the brand to, then I think the opposing party will have to pay royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland's 245 000 orphans from his parents, who had died of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">Already more than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphaned after parents, who died of AIDS, in the village Esitjeni found group Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="23">In the great circle distance 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is, in fact, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which is dependent on the bulk of the votes of the German choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial SPI has syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral failed are HIV, herpes, human special glandis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crabs and scabies belongs to parazitárním failed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to the group of the most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea are especially among men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases, which were reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contacts between the men.</seg>
<seg id="42">With heterosexual adults were sexually transmitted diseases, which occur frequently, chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, kandidóza (mold), gonorrhea and human special.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is between heterosexuálními adults with us extended relatively few, but this group accounted for about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among juveniles are chlamydiové infections occur much more often than other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the European polls with three quarters of all infections involving young people from 15 to 25 years old.</seg>
<seg id="46">For us, the extra special human often occur among juveniles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As the number of infections has developed?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of infections syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled from 1697 disease in 2001 at 3698 diseases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of people newly infected with HIV has been shrinking since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 was approximately 700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is about one-tenth of less than a year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What the signs point to a venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause difficulties in urination, spotting, pain in the abdomen and warts and pimples, boils in the groin area.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, don't cause any pain or other symptoms, and will therefore nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of the disease, but it offers 100 percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Because the perpetrator may partly be transmitted sexually transmitted diseases and infections from impurities and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">So experts recommend, particularly in the event of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis is possible cure most failed and prevent the subsequent consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Due to the patronage, charitable gifts and last but not least honorářům, which earns a choir singing throughout Germany, gather some money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"We have to Esitjeni sent roughly 200 000 euros," says league Chairwoman Annette Lennartz.</seg>
<seg id="63">The money from Germany holds in the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman can impose.</seg>
<seg id="64">Looking also to orphaned children found shelter, for example, some of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo, as they say in the Zulu language, old women are the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have even 14 orphans, taking care of the kids and give them a roof over your head at every day in a timely manner in uniforms to school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Children who no longer have to go to a shelter Khanyisile, the lone woman of the bunch, as well as two of the cooks who cooked on a daily basis for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">"Voices for Africa" also established a school sewing, put the two together with the American health organizations and chicken coops DOGS arranged that have left many people in the village do HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not granted. Even when the disease is so evident in the whole country, everyone is silent about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The King's 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">As a matter of fact rather strange in a country where the king had officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his nemírným lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">The state approved a way of life is, among other things, also blamed on the fact that the HIV virus had spread so rapidly in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">But even many of the migrant workers who took the virus in the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is being used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">At least a little bit to promote cultural exchange, travels the choir Imbongi once every two, three years after South Africa together and singing songs full of grief, militancy, self-esteem and confidence in the future of black, known to many in the southern tip of the black continent yet from the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - such awards not only brings humor and joy, but also has already sparked tears for many wild border troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The road always leads to Esitjeni, where children visit the singers, over which they have patronage.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although hardly find this village on the maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than familiar.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go into Esitjeni, there is light," says the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when you get back to Heidelberg, who is here as the crow flies 8733 kilometers, to dupajícím the singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines even here.</seg>

<seg id="51">The telescope allegedly invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks to broker, are still deeper.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, plans to costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Still, its diameter is about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of cheap fashion design: The telescope is secured hákovadlem in výškovém angle, which is limited his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">In výškovém angle is fixed, the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="62">His curiosity is a high degree of flux amplification.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is despite the relatively small diameter mirror is the largest mirror dalekohledům around the world.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists are based on the fact that Mercury is also the ice at the South Pole.</seg>
<seg id="87">For this, however, there is no reliable data because Messenger circling the planet's far closer to the North Pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements showed that is ice on Mercury, has been at it for several decades.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first one, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">But this here is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The borders with Iran is only a few miles away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here lives Caucasian ethnic group Talyšů, on which it is not too well known, except that speaks perfect Farsi and ázerbájdžánsky and living to a very old age.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The final stop is the Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">But this town is too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow inappropriate in the picturesque mountainous countryside.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe, I don't. The arrival of Baku is too difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: Most stinking fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a few overripe cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put them in the middle of the pile of wet and dirty football gear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let it lie for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you can smell paralyzing the stench rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I'm in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a beautiful view, the snow - and the ever-present odor hung in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is salty fermented trout in the water for up to one year - depends on how much you want to smell the fish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">How is it dark and is getting cold, beginning with the Norwegians meet at the festival dedicated to this, how best to say it, here in Fagernes nejpodmanivějšímu eat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Dreaming it raw and then zapijete drink shall," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General," which is responsible for the conduct of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people are eating fish and celebrating small cubes is a large quantity of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people are better than the rakfisk aquavit," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The smell can transcend the beverage.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few bits and pieces I'll try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, who was on a long journey by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk poverty is the product of a very different time, when she was in Norway, and because there is no fridge, the fish is in the autumn hated getting wet in airtight barrels of water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, plucked and ate - the senses will undoubtedly blunt alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation before thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to look for work, and most emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracting a large number of Labour, high earnings and an extensive system of care.</seg>
<seg id="22">The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is viewed as something important and indispensable, even when fairly smelly part of the past.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among more expensive meals on the market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even when everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is the world's reports often lack - and the majority of the population seems to like it that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing supremacist extremists, who shot 77 men, women and children in the past year, here people still mention with distaste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, it is called the shooting "an event on July 22."</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians can hardly believe that one of them was in their peaceful country capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's oil and gas industries of the early 1970s of the twentieth century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But the oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," he says, when submitting plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, with long blond hair and startling blue eyes, is a prototype Nordic welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as you say, thoughtful people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, as well as English of the majority of these people, it is absolutely impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nepředvádíme is, we don't like pomp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway deals with its oil wealth is very carefully - except for a small percentage of the majority of the money from the industry invested in a special fund to be used for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw the money they did not have the Norwegians had its purse strings tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a careless laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I already have enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such an elk burger is certainly something else and it's beautifully succulent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening's smelly fish here again.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, in which I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk served for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather demanding to smell the fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">Are there connections with live television coverage, in which the host with a bow tie is surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like the Eurovision singing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What's the score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"This is our scoring, Håvard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There are the laughter and applause.</seg>
<seg id="48">The man fell out of his chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe the fumes of all those fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges they face, and at the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">At present, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">Steel barriers were erected in the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, closing several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Objective, however, did not prevent dojíždějícím in it, to get to work, but to avoid protesters in the approach to the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He faces a daunting task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico, at the time the paperwork outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has already taken an estimate as a victim of 60 000 lives in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government is a big commitment in the reduction of violence against the Mexican people," the president said, "Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I suggest a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before the president shook hands with the American president, won Pena Nieta political experience as governor of their home country of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are different views on a new leader, even in his old home, the vast and populous state surrounding the capital city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember him in a good way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Citizens would be credited with the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the city you can now drive along one of the new highways that Pena Nieto left to build. These highways are a vast improvement over the perforated and rugged roads that were here before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of a sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the theme of climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally of Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a member of the State for Labor, the party of President Pena Nieta institutionalised Revolution (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Particularly interesting in our hope and real change in the area of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After continuous 81 years in power have been ousted the PRI party Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, intra-party from Enrique Pena Nieta much is expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new president as a man without substantial content and the opposition refused to comment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It's a very straightforward man, very preoccupied with excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But, on the other hand, there is the impression that has a lot of people from its former governor of this state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Hold, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be clearer.</seg>
<seg id="27">Tucked beneath dálničními culverts in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the local community are also persistent and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help with managing drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, violence against women is particularly poignant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Only in the last two years were in the desolate places beside a vast landfill waste littered the bodies of dozens of murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">At a time when he was the governor of Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women have been murdered in Mexico state, which is far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In a case critics Pena Nieta say during his tenure in office had failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">And in the worst case, his leadership accused of escapism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete house, typical for me, the ramshackle neighborhood Irinea Buendía shows photographs of their deceased daughter Marian Luna and suppresses tears.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her family believes, however, that she was murdered by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I came to her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Mrs. Buendía recalls.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs on him after strikes and had already begun rigor mortis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">As her mother tells a story, Marian staring down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is a single word: "Justice."</seg>
<seg id="40">However, this is as a family says exactly what's been denied them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The government departments they treat me like I was a troublemaker, the old gossip and kňouralka.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want you to just accept what they say, and were silent.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But it cannot be right when it came to many errors and omissions," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Sash, received by the president of Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by a sense of great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the past six years, tens of thousands of families were affected by violent crime in Mexico, the new president promised during his tenure in office will be his priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope the president will be the same, as he was a governor," he says in Valle del Bravo, a member of the PRI Olvera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Hold fears most.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the rough treatment, which he allegedly suffered in military custody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The military prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein during the cross-examination of Private Manning in Maryland in the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede argued that the records of weekly visits that Manning had links with the officers of the unit in the course of nine months at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of ill-treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">A cross-examination, which occurred in the course of the hearing, conducted at the request of the defence to dismiss the case against manning because of the rough treatment while in detention, which is in itself sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that in custody contemplating suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents in the course of their duty in Iraq.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="14">When these forms on Friday Fein asked him Manning admitted that the treatment by their guards be assessed as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility be assessed as "very professional."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even if the officers asked Manning directly on how it is handled, Fein said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning said that orally expressed concerns regarding the various problems, and that the officers, who visited him, talked with him about these concerns and suggested that these problems, however, they will deal with them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"Zapsali had" no problems "(after discussed concerns), and it does not necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Judge Col. Denise Lind asked Manning also why he complained about the treatment of his party in January 2011, when meeting with the commission examining the suicidal thoughts, which a few months earlier expressed in the form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning said that, in the course of this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction scheme "prevention of injury."</seg>
<seg id="20">The army said that for him this restrictive regime (one degree below the supervisory regime on the grounds of suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted the guards are in custody, to know that I'm OK and that I wanted to abolish the scheme of injury prevention... to enjoy enhanced the quality of life, as I see it," Manning said.</seg>

<seg id="22">Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before he was transported to the detention center at the Marine base at Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="23">He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait and once there fainted because of the heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said that he was not allowed to know what will become of him and what's happening in the rest of the world, it was very depressing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world is focused only on the base Arifdžán, on the cage," Manning said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">I thought I would die in that cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Manning said that he had spent most days (at least 21 hours after arriving at Quantico, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.</seg>
<seg id="28">Manning said that he was allowed only one mattresses, blankets, slippers, some clothes and glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He said that he had tried to walk, because sleeping or just in the course of a day camp was against the rules.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">Manning said that he always slept with the light on the outside of the cell in his eyes.</seg>
<seg id="31">The guards said that if they could not see his face, when he turned in the middle of the night, on the other hand, woke him and had to turn back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Manning's lawyer lodged a formal complaint to the treatment of Private Manningem in January 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">Manning was transferred to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for the charges, which raised in Thursday's testimony, on that one night after he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, was also forced to stand naked in front of the other inmates and guards during the counting of the morning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In the calculation, Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover his blanket.</seg>
<seg id="36">During Friday's hearing by Judge Manning said that, on the orders of their guards, he decided that he had to postpone a blanket, which could conceal, but admitted that he was ordered to postpone it, no one has gone before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On Thursday, Manning testified that the night before he was forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that he was not dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning said that the officer said that he could use the belt from his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Manning testified that the night was removed from his cell in his underwear, his eyeglasses and slippers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His lawyer hopes that Judge shall take into account of his experiences during his detention, and that in the event of a conviction before a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his punishment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense has argued that projected that Manning admits to fault in the lesser crimes, and that he will fight against the other accusations, because they are too extreme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The start of a hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the detention conditions as legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon said the declaration that Manning was held in accordance with rules on all of those arrested held in a maximum-security detention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Among the charges against manning include aiding the enemy, illegal infliction of transmission of information relating to national security, intelligence documents on the Internet and theft of public property or records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities that are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left; remind them hard times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I was barely elbowed his way through the crowd, and I got into the space for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Arrow pointing to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in Central California and all my life I've been called the "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is ethnic stands, "and my friends in New York are the same as when my friends in Boston called" the Irish themselves are known as "the Italians."</seg>
<seg id="10">So after I finished with the label of "the Mexican American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I don't know how to get rid of an American accent and vocabulary of native speakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about the moment this week's newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were the usual issues that are discussed, when the leaders of the two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the likelihood that Mexicans will remain in Mexico is the same as that travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada and to create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto has promised that he will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's complicated relationship with the United States and filled with hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never thought to the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite the half of Mexico's territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, observations are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So a minute after Representative of the United States to say something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor in the Mexican press and among the elite.</seg>
<seg id="26">And children Montezumy steps on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Yet it is the real challenge for Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">That's a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers the possibility, and others, who don't.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was the person, maybe the parent or grandparent who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than it should have been, this person fit the profile - dark skin, a weak education, the origin of a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not against Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And now we are living the American dream, go to good schools, and we've got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico's.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is not our loyalty, but sometimes it may be unclear.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is against the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">He sees us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico have failed, I would never leave him.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we are now nenalézali imprisoned for the silk curtain, with the good life in the United States, but despite the lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally traveled to the United States, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if he is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And, at the same time, many Mexican Americans, you know, feel as part of either.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to the Mexican groups, los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">You don't have the best of both countries, but its roots in either one.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we viewed as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And we have considered Mexicans in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And to complicate relations, part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, and some Mexican leaders want to re-connect with the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a makeshift "ambassadors" and represented the Mexican interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and pressure on political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Well.</seg>
<seg id="56">Thus, it won't happen again.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And because income inequality and prevalent corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That's fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how to deal with Mexico in front of one and a half a century, we must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignation over the way it dealt with the members of their family in the past, much closer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">We may be more "Mexicans" than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles, a new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain as the basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is futile.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, has been amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and, for the first time, the rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even if it appears that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them, change with the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has changed the old calculus and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, they are caught in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps it will mean that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither won nor lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems that at the present time, it is not much cause for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, strengthen the hawks on both sides of the fight for this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that forcing the Israelis to retreat, though Gaza suffered defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the most pitiful and most populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well conclude that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Islamists gain greater influence throughout the Arab world, that Hamas won the rich and the powerful friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, revived a regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, joined on the side of Hamas. As well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering people from Hamas say the Islamic crescent circles around Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the ruling party / militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can unseat Bashar al-Assad, after Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on Israel's southern flank the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, by far the most populous and flagship of the Arab countries under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího, changed the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled for 30 years until his downfall in 2011 in Egypt, had on Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Israeli hardliners, however, come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's Iron Dome antimissile system proved their worth and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In a diplomatic terminology is America as hard as always. Many European countries also blaming Hamas for the start of the latest round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And especially - Israel prospered, in particular, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 of the Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from the bomb suicide bombers, thanks in part to the wall, which protects Jewish settlements, which are still growing and intervenes in the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, despite its illegality in front of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party is at the beginning of the campaign to 22 January elections combined with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If he really ruled on the West Bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if we stay behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Hardliners might win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even though the Islamists, who gained power in Egypt and other countries, have little affection for Israel, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israeli defense spending is higher than the expenditure of all four of his Arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The opening of a new war with the local superpower hardly new Arab governments will help to heal its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is a good sign that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama on achieving a cease-fire and may mark the beginning of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis also should look at the situation from a long-term perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a barrel of gunpowder, the denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination, which must one day in areas occupied by Israel to explode - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Currently the repression weaken democracy and demography in the Jewish state, is making the situation worse, as the Arab population is growing.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attacks against Gaza on every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is what they preached reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states, Israel claims the territory for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is some hope that a cease-fire by pressures from the outside at least a little bit more influence to enforce this matter.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must commit to a halt in the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem shared and exchange of parts of the country.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs from outside must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would make more than an immediate offer of virtual statehood in the United Nations for the creation of a Palestinian state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its share of it, how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term negligent performance of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House, appears to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia have entered into force the laws on bad cigarette packaging</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The shabby green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, warnings are designated for smokers and diseased parts of the body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In force entered Australian laws on tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, ugly packaging and logos and colors brands replaced general olive green boxes with ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body and display of children and infants sick as a result of their parents' smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to a variety of health warnings and pictures are compulsory from Saturday brand names, the only difference between the boxes, which are printed in small letters.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the strictest in the world on tobacco packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by failing to get rid of this habit of its attractiveness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Relying on a study showing that if people start smoking until the age of 26 years, the chances that never start smoking is 99%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"I can see for very small children, that means a message that they are trying to sell the tobacco companies together with their product," he says, federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and cites studies that, for example, have shown that children joined at the crown logo with the idea for it to be a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering the introduction of similar events.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will result in cheaper and more abundant cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"With this legislation would lead to substantial unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre from society, British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The forgers from China and Indonesia bring much more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Some argue that the laws have increased their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha from society Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, she said, that the demand on cigarette packages of silicon used to cover unsavoury boxes, two months before, when the company of Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal to the Supreme Court, on bills to Australia's sales increased from almost zero.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that the company sold Zico almost 6 000 wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's a good deal for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a potential snag experts cite the popularity of social media at the demographic group targeted by the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sports events and demanding that the majority of dealers hiding cigarettes before the direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia banned the Internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you are a worker in the tobacco industry marketing and leaves you only this small space for the promotion of your products, is the place where you want to be insurmountable online space for you," says Becky Freeman, a research scientist in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the evaluation of the brands on social networking sites, such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, carried out by "the average John."</seg>
<seg id="23">We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or marketing company is involved in this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says the industry focused on how to deal with the new regulations, than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules - the country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia deals significantly.</seg>
<seg id="26">The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek says that the government has led the talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning pictures in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now widened to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">They think of stricter laws of Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">He resists many smokers in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pictures do not have any influence on me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Just take a cigarette out and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying boxes of photographs of the tumor in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, it is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, who owns trafiku King of the pack in downtown Sydney, argues that the single packs makes it harder for him to come to terms on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"discharge cargo took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government should ban it completely, then we would have said, 'OK, this is the end, closing shop'," he said, and threw up his hands.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world of constant connection isn't so bad to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems, and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I won't lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come to praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that it is good for us (and) our children are sometimes bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And whereas most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have a chance to enjoy the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Therefore, we should support the boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But for that to come back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canada in Calgary, who is the author of the book says Boredom: A Lively History (history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription relating to boredom, dating from the first century A.D.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, "said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario in Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After viewing demonstration of the idea of the target group of about 100 people and research literature professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as an experience, "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't capable of that."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom is the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but I would be different from apathy.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that there is an urge to do something for apathy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that "the disruption of the process of attention is at the core of boredom, joined in a bad mood and feeling slowly ubíhajícího time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom may remind a lot of depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a reciprocal relationship, they have nudící, people tend to see the problem as the environment or people who are depressed, while the rest of the world sees the problem within ourselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that's boring, if we only have trouble concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which the participants listened to the tape, in which a person reading the article out of the magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so low that he barely noticed, while the third group didn't hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard the television program quietly, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble concentrating but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, the distortion of the attention may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "such as the search for the bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help with that, you got bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, we now know that, in fact, twisting and drawing, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can help to fight boredom and keep people physically alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that children, who are allowed to move around, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," Professor Fenske said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all sometimes boredom experienced - my flight delays, roaring speaker, particularly lengthy movie.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals have a greater chance to get bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">For help with boredom measurement of the scientists in the 1980s had developed "a scale for susceptibility to nudění" Boredom Proneness Scala).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale covers issues such as: "Many of the things that I must do is repeated, and is monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have the time to do it all."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">By using these scales scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, teenagers are generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor at the University of Illinois, an experiment for human and social development, in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of adolescents said that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said that they were bored, when they were in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But said that he knows that "adolescence is the time for the boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: "It's good for you boring?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, the physical risks can lead people to undergo absurd, playing games or addictive substance abuse as a way to relieve it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers were discussed, the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain is always the best thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and use the energy to play the guitar and cooking, you'll be happy to do it.</seg>
<seg id="51">If, however, you'll be watching TV, makes you happy just for a little while, not a long-term basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, will no longer be bored, but to learn how to attach itself or separately, Professor Fenske said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "this separate procedure is transmitted from one situation to another," the professor said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learn only how to attach itself, but will gain greater control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we should not be too critical to her.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead, our aim should be to feel comfortable when we're out of the range of the constant ringing of the business and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"blame it needs even more bored, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">What people are really looking for, he said, is how to relax and enjoy free time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is hard to find ways to seized when the noise switched off."</seg>

<seg id="1">There is no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and a football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal in the state as a whole - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which he used to her smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Orozco said that a September day rode with a couple of friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - petty crimes for which the penalty is for every $100 - and he was a court date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"It looked to us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after Colorado a vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response from the hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures, repealed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police Department stopped blaming adults aged 21 years of age and older for possession of a small quantity, which will be legally permitted after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorado have said that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains votes to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the police in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The head of a gossip and regulators in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="14">And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that, at first, Colorado, whether for good or bad, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use, and now, as well as recreation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has regulovanější market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Council for the awarding of licenses for the sale of alcohol in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or the system can do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, the so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also left the annual vacuum, during which the state licensing system will still exist, but legal possession, yes.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the state's directive on "a responsible approach" to licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, playground or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently-based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers of the e-mail in which they announced that the city prosecutor will no longer prosecute misdemeanors for possession of a small quantity of marijuana for each and every citizen aged 21 years and that the police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police will promote municipal laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in northern Colorado represents District Attorney Ken Buck stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push on users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing another charge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offense, which was crimes at the time they occurred," Mr Buck said in its statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was also complicated in places like rural district, Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, already adults responsible for possession of a small quantity.</seg>
<seg id="30">The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all pending cases of possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I don't think losing his time until a continuation in law enforcement, will not change," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of Colorado voters support the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and legal system will never be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory reactions across the state green experiment with regard to this great state has revealed a deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For the district prosecutors is that "the cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the laws relating to marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"Strávili prosecution of people that still cannot really take so much of her life, it's legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states to treat a small quantity of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised sales and at the same time also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice complies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several arrest vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and patients who use it to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in the operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While protidrogoví agents will probably not break down the door, to pick up a small bag with the drug, it is likely to fight back, allowing state-controlled stores with recreational marijuana for new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drug policies of President Obama's administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">A number of Colorado cities waiting on the procedure of the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before they will be able to open any trade.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week the city Montrose a half-year ban proposed in the western part of the state, and it is likely that next week will come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone we license and then we will have a federal case out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community has voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">Look at what a municipality voted, compared to what had happened.</seg>
<seg id="47">There's a lot of questions.</seg>

<seg id="4">Both my father and my elder brother studied at the university, about which I thought that knowledge is the world's largest seat, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, tolerance and freedom of thought.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet I think at the end of the 1980s into two weeks after boarding at Worcester College, where I wanted to study the history of the twentieth century, packed suitcases and I swept into the first scandal of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke down and wept.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I didn't give up, because I objected to love of students in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left, because I was forced to drink from battered cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less comical.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran because I was the subject of a systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was being pursued in this cradle of alleged enlightenment and for one reason was that both barbaric and bigoted: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a senior adviser Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You can ask why yank it until now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simply because recent reports indicate that a new generation of students to the right of center suffer similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week was a group of these students demanding the same protection of equal rights, which are gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the Association of younger people (JCR) at Corpus Christi College maintains that because of their political views "are often subjected to personal attacks, actively isolated, and they made clear that they are not welcome."</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand equal opportunities for the creation of a position in the university committee that would ensure that his views may communicate freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">They didn't help the situation neither recently that BBC television documentary entitled Two Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (stories of the country: The young, intelligent and right-wing) on student politics, which conservatives described as odd and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the agenda was presented a graduate Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), the conservative Association of the University of Oxford, who drove a silver Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a staff of the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Conservative students at other universities say that is due to the introduction of higher tuition treated as "scapegoats" with them.</seg>
<seg id="23">A 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told a Sunday newspaper, that "left-wing influence is growing at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People feel that we're as Bullingdon Club, without ever meeting with us. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">A student of history at Corpus Christi said Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is "bad," while devatenáctiletá elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says in the approach of the JCR members against the people to the right of center has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">During his first weeks in Oxford, I was a member of a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">I started in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hatred against the Conservative party was nejhorečnatější.</seg>
<seg id="30">A year earlier the university voted to reject the awarding of an honorary degree of Margaret Thatcher's former student due to cuts in funding for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">From the atmosphere would be even Stalinists shivered concerns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">During the first few days in the opening week, when new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, who had to come.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that not only professors tacitly approving needling conservative students, but with gusto, he also attended.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">The policy was introduced in the paneled poslucháren mining strikes, privatization, and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="35">My first lecture focused on the translation of the text of the 18th century French into English and I was not prepared for what followed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate the first paragraph, please."</seg>
<seg id="37">It's hard enough.</seg>
<seg id="38">Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a lot of dough dessert was bilious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students snickered.</seg>
<seg id="41">Tears in my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you took some basic lessons in his spare time French, that is, if you're not too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Heartbroken I returned to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the dinner I sat alone in the school, when I felt a tap on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a sophomore student named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said softly.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, this is so.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the conservative freshmen pretends that are labouristi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later at a local pub, cowardly, I tried to pretend.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted on the fact that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick has proved unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You are the daughter fascist pig."</seg>
<seg id="55">You are infected.</seg>
<seg id="56">The other students took with him notovali.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverse, messy.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How will the Conservatives love?" one asked.</seg>
<seg id="59">Hitting each other, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like the need to feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">I could ever to lead a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">I'd have to be converted into labouristu and suppress your natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years in front of me to develop as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Norman Stone, professor of modern history, was the only openly conservative professor who was at my school.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was hated not only for being conservative, but also for the fact that is one of those who write her speeches and Margaret Thatcher's adviser for foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="67">It almost wasn't there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place for his parochialism and pettiness and for his choice of Marxist-deterministickému perspective on history.</seg>
<seg id="69">The professor came on the scene in 1997 at Bilkentské University in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="70">"You won't happy here," he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to travel from Oxford to his parents' house in London, seeking refuge at their uncommitted metropolitan friends and family.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">He couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s were accepted by all political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.</seg>
<seg id="76">It wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamlike mood.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends have always had the perfect manners.</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes became troubled.</seg>
<seg id="79">Try it again.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that it was only a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">My heart would break if you left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted frequent trips to London with my emotional resilience deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="83">A friend of mine, a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his conviction.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in utter seriousness I declare that "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Even when I was inside flushed with shame, I confessed to my parents "brainwashed" and called it "old fogies."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The relief was only short-term.</seg>
<seg id="87">My father hammered a nail in the coffin of my career.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time he wrote two columns every week to Murdochových newspapers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I crouched inside and give it my pursuers after five minutes.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I packed my suitcase and grabbed the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I've never came back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me usmrkaným wimp.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no 18letá girl or boy should not be subject to this kind of intimidation in the educational institution and rancor.</seg>
<seg id="95">Even more tragic is, however, that it was Oxford, of which only came 14 conservative prime, but who is also behind the undeserved reputation points to date, with equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">For four of the euro gamble medium in the area of the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, when 70 kilos of sulphur swoop down the steep stone paths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who are literally working in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners, who earn a living conquest of sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of this, every day fárat up on the floor of the crater, where sulfur gases escaping from the interior of the Earth, and in contact with air passes into a solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After all the large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carrying them on their shoulders in two bamboo baskets after the steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it's just 250 yards, but exhausted bearers takes more than 40 minutes to get up at the pace of a tortoise, because his steps to maintain the balance and thoroughly reflected neuklouzli and nezřítili looked into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as it happened, one French turistce, which years ago collapsed from the rocks Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each pound of sulfur, which earns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When they are at the top, making his way past the tourists, who is tired of photographs, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and carry heavy weight toward the basket, which the mining company ranked slightly below, in 1850 metres altitude.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, in a volcano, benefit from 1960 and never pay their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">It sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) in the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is to be used for the manufacture of matches, entertaining fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Because we normally carries 70 pounds, earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," Anto explained to us, which usually undergo three trips a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way he takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but they can earn 138, 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though it seems like a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what he earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The wage miners here is very high, for example, is paid for the collection of coffee per day and a salary of 15,000 rupees ($1.2 billion) in a fortnight's two million rupees (167 euros)," explains Porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a valid reason, which is as convincing as sulphur: "I Married with a young girl from Bali in Indonesia, which is Hindu, and I took her to Java, to have converted to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, he kept his eyes and coughing, breathing the toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years Anto three times a day he's risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur put on him has already begun to take its toll, even though her face is protected by a special mask and goggles.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, poorly kept his eyes and coughing, breathing the toxic gases, which escapes from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price that must pay for it, in order to achieve his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work for two more years, because I want to open a store or to study French or Spanish," promises more than a passable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This likable and intelligent young man racked fate could be tourist guide, waiter or reception in the hotel, and instead of doing the work of the rack.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shares dirty wooden shack with other carriers and every day rises at two o'clock in the morning, because of her characteristic yellow glow in the dark and amended in blue and sulphur in the middle of the night continues to break out.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto into the crater and sheds light on his way to a lamp, which is attached to his helmet, and he bought her for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 media rules on the shoulders of the basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has high-sulphur production due to cost savings, revenue nezmechanizovala, nor provide porters working on his own and with such vigor, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nor do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from a surcharge for photography, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees ($1.2 billion) collect natural park wardens from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," pleads Madrusin, burly 42letý Porter, who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left the school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it will work, "as long as possible," because he needs the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, since the volcano was my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulphur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turn and snared the miners in thick fumes coming from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... but it is evident from the frequent respiratory difficulties, into arthritis, the wounds on the shoulders and knee pain caused by the weight of their baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Unainik, who balances his basket on his back at the age of 53, he can no longer serve only 50 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his colleagues vydolují in a volcano 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three trucks transporting a steep path through the thicket into storage in Tamansari 18 miles distant.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I am not going to retire, I'm going to die here, since the volcano was my whole life," declares Unainik and opens his mouth wide, in which is missing a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">The oldest of his five sons, 30, also makes mining sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but chronic poverty remains one of the world's most difficult crafts from generation to generation - craft carrying out human mules in Kawah Iljen.</seg>

<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">Whoever takes it very lightly, it is the Government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">A year spent $1 300 to encourage people to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The government's package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extending maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">All these measures have had little effect, though.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in the south-east Asia, also known konzervatizmem of its leaders and the strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is regarded as the recovery rate in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why Singapurci do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Mingová Tan Wei, director of the department of marriage and the family of the National Office for the population, he says, it is because of "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"People that are available to a wider range of options as regards the objectives and priorities, it is not only a wedding and family," he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. The result is a reduction in fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">For example, she affect trade with real estate.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="35">The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "a shoe box," which could be built in certain urban areas.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the developers EL Developers, claims that their "a shoe box" sell far more quickly than larger homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"They are more popular, and so that it will sell for days and weeks at a faster pace than the houses with a larger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">Because they are so much better for our cash flow. "</seg>

<p>
<seg id="41">Developers, who were previously limited admits, however, that the new standards set out clear rules, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one of the project.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="42">Too much on edge</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is the city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although the new rules could lead to an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that will not have a big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, like education, because it puts a lot of people," says a young officer.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="48">Men and women cite a career, stress, and the cost of living and education as the reasons which prevents them from having children.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová notes that Marc Prensky, a graduate academic pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the article digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.</seg>

<seg id="45">Explains spread, publish, and say that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate, and what they cannot, in an age when they are not yet ripe for it."</seg>
<seg id="46">Also, to be - what concerns surrounding - circumspect, at a time when what is most wants to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to this Specialist asking questions, privacy is the most effective way to show children and adolescents, what is it that makes them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"telling them to do something doesn't work," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the possibilities: Are the things you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or would you like it, if someone published a picture of you as you published a pal's?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the rest of you should be published?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="54">The other point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It's the same rules.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, the creation of a South American citizenship, which support the member countries of the Organisation Unasur defended the project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the framework of any South American country, which is already under way among members of the Andean Community, however, there are still backward areas that we want to go back to the past," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Ecuador's president, expressed, inter alia, that agrees with the redeployment of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that will reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Those who are in the lead, never to be useless bind, and all of the South Americans, on the other hand, we will sign.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights in Washington, D.C., is funded by the United States, "he said in allusion to political asylum from Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">President Correa said that he regrets this decision, because it betrayed its principles, and respect their "profound democratic values and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">Said that at the time "there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, the Swedish justice who criticised him demanded that he underwent questioning on Swedish territory because of alleged sexual infringement, "the Swedish legislation of their own to conduct the questioning videokonferenčním call, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk that the Assangeho will lead to a deterioration in the physical and psychological health.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Have I'm with him since he was in the embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a tiny lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuador, the head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Within that his physical and psychological state worse, because it is locked in a small space, but without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.</seg>
<seg id="15">That would have affected the health of everyone, "said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">President Correa said that dealing with the asylum granted Assange since June to still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the talks with London in order to solve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"We use such a word about human rights are not negotiating, in this case, but still continued talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads the series of proceedings in various European bodies, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It said that "if Britain gives a pass tomorrow, it would be the end of it."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears on still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the legislation without a problem, as has been done in other cases, this problem tomorrow will be made out. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and make it clear that it does not tolerate bad intentions, "podprůměrnost and lies which undermine freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">The biggest enemies of a free press is not us, mean and vicious politicians, but bad press in the service of profit pressures and blackmail, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">From this point of view expressed joy over the fact that Ecuador lacked such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic countries and even the bourgeoisie," and said that, if re-elected, "continue the changes instituted the right way and in the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain a veto by Paraguay on membership Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and netolerovat opportunism and pučismus wrapped into the legality" because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Ecuador's president, in addition, has said that he considers "entirely appropriate" wishes his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the days following the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's a problem between South American and-countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is necessary to assess broadly to have been overcome, and was able to move forward. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Chile and Peru have also expressed hope for a settlement of the dispute on the maritime borders, which deals in the same court, and expressed the view that "it was right for Latin America to seek an international resort, where the two countries commit to accept the judgment, whatever will be tough."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"I personally never cared much, but so unfair situations, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, they can only correct political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">My political movement believed that it is I who guarantees this unlikely victory, so we must accept this responsibility, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"If I had won, it would be my last term, and then I walked away from politics.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The victims of AIDS today are the result of the late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabriziovi was 21 years old when it was confirmed the result of his test: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It's like a bolt of lightning struck me," "softening" told in his memory at the moment of truth, that the doctor tried, but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy was kept from the family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his own illness on their shoulders and began to inform it. And with such vigor that he celebrated the 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is without a doubt one of the earliest patients Units of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio resides with the human virus (HIV) protocol from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The director of the clinic with him at the time of Mexico's Social Security Institute (IMSS) say, 'because he had a cut. "</seg>
<seg id="9">Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.</seg>
<seg id="11">But there is a lot of people who are coming and doesn't know about his illness, when the virus caused the destruction of an organism and vysílil the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since the AIDS disease appeared in the world, or at least since the earliest documented cases, "means a great success, that the life expectancy of a patient, which begins in a timely and appropriate manner with the treatment, is exactly the same as for healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of Unit HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and a specialist in HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of a full life and survival depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients, in whom the disease is diagnosed, the better are the ones who are taking drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with more than 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, it means that someone who is HIV can be diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in adherence to live up to 75 years without any problems," the doctor explained in an interview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The highlight of this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years old today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS declined from 4 to 6 678 in 2007 862 in 2011 (yearbook Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the state of Jalisco had died in 2011 255 people, and in May of this year, while 187. However since 2005 is secured universal access to antiretrovirotikům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why do people still die from preventable diseases?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - "It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities for access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The way I see it, this is happening for us in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least for the last 12 years we have not run out of supplies of medicines. The problem is that patients are coming at a very late stage, because they do not know the condition of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds compelling figure: "Nine out of 10 patients comes when they arise some associated infection. The only thing to do is to diagnose the disease earlier and therefore should be offered on a large scale, so that we can influence the overall mortality rate more tests for the detection of the disease all persons who requests them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients like Fabrizio, who had come to do the tests by a private laboratory just because he did it his friend, and, despite his low age with him had erupted AIDS and also suffered from cancer, Kaposi sarkomem, which is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they die, and they don't want to know anything else.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I die, rather, three times a week vyřádím," they say, but it's not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="28">His parents still knows only that he suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I live a normal life like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person, "enumerates Fabrizio, who accepted an invitation to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco, those who are afraid to motivate his testimony today in connection with World AIDS Day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Whatever they do tests. If risk, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, it's better. And if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, when they will be responsible."</seg>
<seg id="32">That's the message summarizes the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">There is a big gap between ordinary citizens and programs for health, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds the information regarding the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest gaps are in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, this task is dedicated to "actually increased handing out condoms, before they gave us today will also give us the packages, one or two hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What do you want it?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from pharmacies and medical staff, school counselors, social workers, employees who want to avoid the teenager, the reporter says.</seg>
<seg id="39">This suggested the inefficient allocation change. Whether condoms are not just behind desks, but the hundred he is located in dávkovačích goes on public restrooms, often in places where the young.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It's not promoting promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nor does it on them "to pay for a beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to a question if he would agree to the distribution rubbers in his district.</seg>
<seg id="42">Takovásexualita not. It's best to make condoms available to those who already hold sex life, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key figures in the state Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">13 435 cases was recorded 158 1 317 cases of HIV and AIDS cases (12).</seg>

<seg id="1">The judgment by the Court of Appeal in the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company Grupo Vitro set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, causing an unfortunate precedent for any national undertaking with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Therefore, it seems that the procedures of corporate restructuring, which allow Mexican laws, Stars and Stripes in the country despite international agreements do not apply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The approval of the ruling issued June 15 last year a judge Harlinem Hal in a bankruptcy court for North Texas el Bravo leaves in the practice of Mexican firms without defense against the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, a judgment opens the glass door to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against the three main Mexican producers of irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First of all, it must be said that while the judge in this case alleges that the creditors have to manage the Insolvency Act of the United States, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For one thing, it would indicate the ignorance of international legal cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In essence, the model for the unification of international trade law, which the organization by the American Law Institute determines the arbiter of the United Nations was created for this purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgment provides that, without a vote of branches of internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro against branches would not have reached the required majority for approval of the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the Mexican laws acknowledge this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fact is that the company Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are a half-dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose internal debts guaranteed by the Federal Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, there is the fact that even after deduction of branches by the creditors - who votes against the company Vitro stood before a court in the United States, that is, funds "vultures," such as Liverpool and Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional, Aurelios Capital Limited - did not have a majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From a different angle, the court accuses the company Vitro from the difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis, which hit in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the meantime the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal for a new assessment directly at the court of appeal to the examination was carried out in full participation, with the participation of five judges, because only three originally voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">If he fails here, will require an appeal of the revision process more instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">On the case, it is significant that the court failed document sent to the Mexican Government as amicus curiae, a department in which Vitro's procedure is described in detail in the framework of the bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company had eased by adhered to the agreements signed by both countries, the act to be confronted with Chapter 15 of the insolvency law of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Navícse points out that the country will follow the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules intended for international insolvency cases, which guarantees equality for borrowers and lenders.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="12">It was a series of successful years, including five Championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I started one šampionátem farewell - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, "Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"I remember that the coach Gene Bartow, who was here before, and by the time he taught at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me: 'I have the big trunk for you the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want it? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever Puerto Rico should.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow me then recommended rozehrávače Gausseho Raymond, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that, he said that if Mincy brings Bayamonu victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to the next. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The team for the championship when los Vaqueros played Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance because, president of the Basketball Federation has already performed in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the time, wanted to devote full time to his functions and enjoy Mincyho position in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"I remember when we beat the United States for the first time in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we left off neighborhoods, but we should have had the bronze if it hadn't been for that of the Canadian panel, which allowed us to repeat the final clerk, "Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The national team is the best team from the World Cup in 1990, which you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the national team in 1991, when we won gold and vypráskali Panamerických Games in Cuba are the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that blew us bronze at the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team should not only Gausseho, Ramona, Mincyho Rivase, Fico Lopez and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also the young men were there (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" and Francisco Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which might not be the perfect composition, but managed to win a gold medal, and bring great joy in Argentina in 1995, was the team of the Olympic qualification Neuquénu.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the players on this roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players ruled out for the sake of the skirmish in the Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, we won the gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What was the best player Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one from Puerto Rico achieved at this level results such as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to mention his tenure in different leagues, where he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best portorickým coach?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good generation, to which Julio Toro, Meléndez Flor, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau belong, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the young, I would very much like the work of the Leo Arilla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">That its success in a federation consider the greatest?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">That I was part of the most famous of the era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, and that she had the National League BSN in a single season in the early 1990s to 17 teams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> What did you do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things that I wanted to introduce as the division of youth categories according to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that the guys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">I also see a benefit in statutory certificates and courses for coaches, referees and umpires assistants.</seg>
<seg id="46">I'm delighted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">As I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I'm enjoying grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">As a religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to do this semester course about the end of the world, he knew it to be an irresistible lure: The end of "a number" Mayského calendar, which is to come on December 21, has caught many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Charmé, however, he had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: The disastrous hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call the "Armageddon" debt, and a growing conflict in which Israel is involved, the place in which according to Christians teoretizujících Apocalypse would begin by the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I didn't realize that this will be nejapokalyptičtější semester ever was," he said Charmé this week students Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the man finally, what is happening in the world today, as if we had 30 days, it's really a good time.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember the bad news is good for the apocalyptic-minded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And it is not the only one professor, which offers courses in "the end of the world" in this semester, which is, in theory, the last in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Hosts the Temple University assistant professor Barry Vacker course "Means, culture and the end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week the students examine apocalyptic themes like zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming, nuclear war.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11">"Why we are these ideas to expand over time," he says, and both offer a hypothetical scenario, which is governed by a human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the nuclear material, for example, gets into the hands of terrorists, the war could erupt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month analysed students films with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from the examples from real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," says Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history is put together, Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, technical assistant art history and anthropology to hold course with the simple title of the End of the World.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "impending doom" students must study to create projects and make final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At Penn State's final test will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which makes the students no option but to work "until the evening just assumed the end of the world," said Restall.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">"Roztáhl within two hours," Restall said on its course for students with a high average, which came forward 35.</seg>
<seg id="21">Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we have received e-mail questions whether he is still in place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students themselves to assure that the course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It seems like fascinating to see what people are doing, to console ourselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.</seg>

<seg id="27">"Enjoy it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no vyzpovídaný student, let alone a professor, said that he believes in the end date of December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project dealt on Mayan predictions, and in some ways it vyvracíme," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá student last year at Temple University of West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"the Mayans never nepředpověděli the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But added that apocalyptic anxiety that goes back a few centuries that people respond to changes in their environment exists in Western culture predictions about the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet boom has caused such speculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Maybe people think on it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is in the overwhelming majority in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, on the question of whether there knows about a course on "the end of the world," he answered quickly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines is not involved in the rest of the world," he wrote, and made an exception for the highest office.</seg>
<seg id="37">We've got a pardon from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall said that, over the years, 21 December spoke of many of the last days of the court, and said that if nothing happens, "people will begin immediately to think about the next date" or philosophy that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, expire at the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
