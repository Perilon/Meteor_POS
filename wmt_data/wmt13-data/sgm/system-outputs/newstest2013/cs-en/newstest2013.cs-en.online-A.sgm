<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican party's strategy against Obama's reelection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify their policies is a necessity in the fight against electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennanovo Centre, however, such fraud refers to as a myth, saying that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after lightening.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, moreover, for the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada, the u.s. have responsibility for the organisation of federal elections.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in this spirit most American Governments since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult for the process of elections, or write to the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has seen a boom after the elections in November 2010, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of u.s. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">These laws also limit the period for the elections in advance, supersede the right to sign up on the list of electors on the day of the election and withdrawing the right to vote to citizens with a criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006, would not require voters to present photo identification půkazu any American State.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first country to introduce this requirement, it was Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutionality of the law was confirmed by indianského in 2008, the u.s. Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities busied with the extension of this procedure as well as to other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the last two years have supported proposals for such laws in 34 States, with the aim to force voters to present photo identification cards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, unlike Quebec do not have American citizens universal identity card, such as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, owns 11% of American citizens. 21 million persons in the age to vote, no photo ID issued by a Government Office of their State.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, does not have such an ID card for about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the acquisition of the certificate of identity is often more than one hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new limit will disproportionately affect mainly the young, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $ 35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 years and 20% of the voters aged 18 to 29 years old therefore does not have the identity card with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students who are as voters known for their conversion to democratic candidates in several States are not authorized to use your ID card with a photograph issued by your school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, these same States may allow members of hunting and fishing clubs, opting rather to Republican candidates, cards issued by these clubs in the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, would not require any State document of citizenship at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such requirement introduced by Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since a dozen States adopted the 2011 law requiring voters to prove they are u.s. citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures clearly are aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.</seg>
<seg id="31">Indeed, should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators in 2011 in eight States have supported laws that cancels the registration of voters on the day of the election.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have their own implications.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during general elections in 2004, helped campaign for the registration of voters to register some 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken after the year 2009 but caused the drop in when writing new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican lawmakers in five other States have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008, Florida made up 33% of African American voters, who voted in advance, although African-American voters in that State was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">For Hispanics it was as well.</seg>
<seg id="40">Made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other side of the white men, who accounted for 76% of all voters, consisted of only 46% of voters who voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Against pass laws, which restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly built democratic legislators and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic Governors have blocked his veto several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">In order to suspend the most controversial laws hitting even the Attorney General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">Damage they partly curbed.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, laws requiring submission of the identity card with a photograph taken just 16 from 34 States.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly introduced rules, however, quite difficult to power in the 2012 vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics of the talks mainly about the bias of the approved laws and consider them for the obvious effort to affect the results of the 2012 election in key States.</seg>
<seg id="49">Brennanova report of the Centre from 2011, shows that the States where those laws were approved, representing 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain already: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the American democratic system.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The detection of prostate cancer: tests or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA Test can yield false results that have been incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of this has increased the hesitancy of men, who are already reluctant to investigate at all.</seg>
<seg id="4">To be examined or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked the opinion of two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the United States showed a high degree of contamination between the tested groups, it is difficult to interpret the results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time European, found differences in mortality among patients who underwent testing, and those who did not go to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also demonstrated after the 12letém distance, that those who do not go to investigate, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="9">I recommend therefore, screening from age 50 or 40 years if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men are also more at risk of a group of African-American origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision, as soon as the cancer is discovered.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and such species which are inert.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to properly explain the patient's degree of hazard of his kind of cancer, to offer him alternatives, neléčit necessarily prostate cancer that does not have a long-term impact on their lives, and to focus in these cases more on active surveillance of diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, a number of men, for which she was diagnosed with cancer, left untreated, because their kind of cancer is not aggressive and does not jeopardise the life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We design them rather implementation of active surveillance, and in the case of disease progression to offer them treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater precision design criteria to help you decide which kind of cure and which not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, I recommend testing still to complete.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the important thing is to undergo an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate or not to undergo the examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the international urological societies established a movement Movember tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in the context of the examination of the DOG.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Disease prevention</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle method for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risk of adopting a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving is enough, you could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would be increased to at least 50%," underscores the André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian society for cancer research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancers caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian society for cancer research remains a priority the fight against smoking, though the number of smokers is declining.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also a risk factor for several others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It's extremely detrimental to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today's 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," shake their heads spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">An encouraging indication: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking decreases the risk of cancer death by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The Weight Of The</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Tělnatost and obesity are in accordance with the SCC additional risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommended to limit consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">At too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is advisable to avoid, as well as cold meats, which are subject to the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Preserving of meat smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"May cause damage to the cells of the organism, and lead to the development of cancer," says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, various researchers have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Research, however, has so far failed to produce unequivocal conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="47">The study focused on vitamin E in accordance with the SCC are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although according to one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks rather about the increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">No effect of vitamin D for cancer is not clearly demonstrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about your concerns and precedent from the family physician.</seg>
<seg id="51">"To submit to an examination does not mean that you have cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson are examined by the</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Notification of the Higgs boson of the likely discovery raised legitimate uproar last summer.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all mass in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And this is the last particle whose existence predicts the standard model-our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter-which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So far, there is little sense among physicists, with 100% certainty that it is a Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">No doubt about it, that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgsovu boson, as predicted in the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">New data published this week in the great physics Congress in Kyoto it rather confirmed, however, in the absence of any information to be able to have absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, let's assume that it is a Higgs boson, since the risk of error, it appears as a small, and look at what's going on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world is completely unambiguous law, according to which two things cannot exist at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">You cannot bypass this rule-and it's never too hard, otherwise you hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even though it is a very strange world of particle physics, it turns out that it applies a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if you are in the same "quantum state"-this "status" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Particle physicists were further divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand we find a decent citizens, also known as fermions, which obediently follow the Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end are bosons, sons of anarchists who do not appreciate nothing at all-certainly not this principle, which means that they can still be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the devices (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: mesony, here we leave unnoticed, and "force particle", which spreads the great forces of nature, and with whom is the Higgs boson, probably connected in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, to say that these bosons are not as exotic animals, as would have been possible to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you read this article, it is thanks to boson with an unusual banality: the photon, the particle of light ", or" that is "bearer" to electromagnetic forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">When a particle with an electric charge to speed up or change its direction, "interrupted" by an electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "interruption" is electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a fotonem-and thus one of the bosons, "holders of power".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Also it is with Higgsovým bosonem, with the only difference being that "disturb" it is necessary to other field, Higgsovo field, to make this boson appeared.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the excitation is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen lake, already moves just a lot of big rocks.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge Collider Accelerator at the laboratory as part of the CERN Large Hadron Collider-with dedicated volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! -in order to develop such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field, we again suited to elucidate the relationship between Higgsem and matter.</seg>
<seg id="25">With the electromagnetic field is because not all the particles do not react or all materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do so, but not others-for example, a piece of paper will never by itself to stick on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And as well, with Higgsovým field do not respond all particles: those that do so, have a certain mass, while others (such as the photon, let's look at him) do not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Mrs. Smith asks, what all of these researches are what "will"?</seg>
<seg id="29">In terms of science with regard to confirming the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to study any mismatch between the observation and predictions of the SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many physicists, literally wants to find them, because the slightest difference in space could open up "new physics" and close some of the gaps in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to note, that model has not yet huge flaws, does not add any elucidation of gravity (Whoa!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the space of matter (again!).</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, however, the CERN facility such contradictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The Response Of The</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The response of these researches in the daily lives of Mr and Mrs Novak can be predicted only with great difficulty, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Look here: at the very beginning of the 1960 's. years should not be the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs, nor any idea of the revolution, already their work occurs.</seg>
<seg id="36">Expected scientific use, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">Physicist Willard Boyle-who worked at Bell Labs, where he was the laser in the 1960s invented and created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I have already said-laser was initially considered to be such a "toy to the lab".</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides, it can also result from the application of all the tools that surround research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during their work focused on optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, even though it initially planned at all so Boyle, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world, and earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC are bound to change your life, it means that you really never know ...</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Through its Commission for dying with dignity, Quebec has recently engaged in delicate questions about the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should continue at the same time, and soon is going to Bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this crucial area of a lot of work remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. l. has lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, which it consumed with a two-year reprieve granted to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They were giving me five years of life, and it's been seven," he says without emotion on his cot in the House for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil where arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has done its work: with tremendous weakness it prevents them from remove himself to the bathroom or eat alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Eyes looking at the delicious-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a bold and even smiles, conversing with strangers who stop him, brings him medicine, offer a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage to death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, this is embarrassing to me," confides.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team of doctors found on his drug problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In his life a man teaches that guys Peeing standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">To return to the stage of the child is for some people unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"Depends on the capabilities of man", whether he accepts the return, says psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the opinion of a number of individuals dealing with palliative care, with the crucial moments are taking place in the very heart of such a return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who picked up home with palliative care, Victor-Gadbois, suffers from all the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Their prognosis is not more than three months to live.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, they are a team of doctors and nurses that care of them, does not provide so-called "therapeutic" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the case of Mrs. a., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die "on suffocation in full consciousness".</seg>
<seg id="24">Disease but to discover their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I've got good kids," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In my life I have no wishes," he says, and then gives her to have breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet he still looks forward in the days ahead on the last visit son of Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In a home Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers provides body care with the help of nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">So looks like palliative care, which comes when you cannot do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">That death was more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Québeku find one bed palliative care at 11,700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, if we realize that we all are going to die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life goes on under optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors at home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether in terms of the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When a person dies, you can give him, for example, a SIP of brandy or pepsi, to taste.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics no longer need to keep an eye on your blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is a part of everyday life here.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night, carrying a beer Mr. X, who died later in the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning his son finishes a beer in honor of the late father.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardová, Director of nursing services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In a home Victor-Gadbois go days one after the other, but not with each other.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to the třiadevadesátiletého of a man who was the last meeting with my family thoroughly vypodložený on the cushions, while his připíjejí in his honor, dies tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after having tried all the possibilities to do so, in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"Six months ago there is always three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer to 45 years old," she says with concern Dr Christiane Martelová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients who in a home Victor-Gadbois come, come from their homes, 47% of the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care. to care, which is intended to mitigate the suffering of the sick as soon as reaches the final stage of their lives, whether it's at home, in a hospital or nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and Company for home palliative treatment area Grand Montréal, specialize in more or less exclusively to the care provided to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And it was this essential health care unavailable in Quebec leads to the fact that many doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is circulating a manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount, and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martelové is not a Quebec health system powerful enough to ensure access of all persons to high-quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree to perform euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, recently had a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in huge pain without anyone did take the necessary steps to make her feel better.</seg>
<seg id="52">Fears that patients did not ask about the killing on the grounds that they do not get appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, many oncologists caring for his patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové have been minimal, leaving the arduous chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When my onkoložce that I'm done with treatment, she said, that she regrets it, losing fight, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">And told me that it's over!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no omnipotent care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Doctor Martelová it is estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to their treating physicians to consider that their wishes have not completed when their team palliative pussy eased pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereauové, Director for palliative care in the home palliative care society of Grand Montréal, patients prevents treatment of pain in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of his life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the time of death, whether by fits and starts, or whether they are permanently served him a sedative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">You cannot pretend that this part of the ordeal.</seg>
<seg id="63">The patient, which outraged pain, will have an increasing ability to access paliativním sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Sick, which is not provided with a sedative, they say, always the same: "I want to die".</seg>
<seg id="65">But it does not always necessarily mean "I want you to me euthanasia", rather it means "I want to get rid of me pain".</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other public officials from the realm of transport admitted that they had to pay compensation for that, about 30% to 40% of the nadhodnocovali through false invoices for the extra work.</seg>

<seg id="33">On A Regular Basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "the public officials they had hundreds of millions of dollars", but worried in particular tasks "members informed about this", if these backroom nenamočili!</seg>
<seg id="35">It is estimated that 70% of the funding of electoral campaigns in Québeku comes from money laundering, and with irony: "I've heard that this is just a weak decoction of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">A Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to $ 100 to the parties, but it does not solve the situation, according to him: "as long as they strictly restrict the electoral expenses, dirty money disappear from politics."</seg>
<seg id="37">Proposes a comprehensive control of public procurement and financing parties: "we can't drop which; If we focus on the nature of things, boldly we can build again on stronger foundations and greater control and compliance with the law. "</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is FC Barcelona."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you have deployed an entirely new pace of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this evolution?</seg>
<seg id="4">Can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone to each other, or a totally new dimension of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">They came to us with great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day I am beside them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Technical team too much help.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every day these facts allow me to elevate their games.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it's easier for matches.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything goes so fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not losing my head.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my beginnings in the preparer in INF Clairefontaine after moving to Saint-Etienne I have always walked on the various stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, a competitive environment you are using, which introduced Carlo Ancelotti ...</seg>
<seg id="14">Reinforcements from this summer are accustomed to play matches at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that any training is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it follows from this that a player like me has a bigger appetite to match, and wishes to give maximum performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plus a lot of Carlo Ancelotti gives me in connection with my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">To his assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And Ancelotti has the operative word at the right time?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of Course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti has the respect of all engineers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today is 1. the League peers, and one of the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has tremendous experience and with top teams won a lot of titles.</seg>
<seg id="24">He also worked with excellent players.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to me is going to win the title in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I attended a comforting interview.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had a number of injuries behind him.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trust me, is another reason my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As you look at the first part of the season, PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 1. the League picked Lyon us frontal position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we're staying in tow.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is the Champions League: we very easily advanced to the round of 16.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What does your club goal in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We'll try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be a quality European teams a tough opponent.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want first to win its qualifying group ahead of the Port, in order to be able to play in the round of 16 at home in retaliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">PSG may state in the short term a major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">The budget has already ...</seg>
<seg id="40">To Paris has become a major European club must win titles and enter into history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the financial aspects of the PSG means that this intention was carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a great failure in nezvítězit 1. League as in last year's season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">A lot of this year we want to win the League title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In last year's season are still missing.</seg>
<seg id="47">In may, we were disappointed because we had to win the game.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had a great season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We've collected 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Typically, with 79 points, you clear the master ...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another Club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think this year it will lead.</seg>
<seg id="53">Although the title to the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons to beat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect a lot from us because what is here and what we have invested players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept it totally.</seg>
<seg id="57">Is the fact that when at home to beat Troyes 4-0 and still finds something in the papers accuse us, so it's not very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what from you people still may want more.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is not, of course, winning 4-0 on each weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We Are FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to set up the game's style.</seg>
<seg id="62">To build a team, you need time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League we proved that we can play.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, who has already qualified for the finals for the second season, and in doing so too have invested large amounts!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In relation to the case of sumám, is to be expected that you will have in front of the other 15 points ahead of the curve!</seg>
<seg id="66">By insulting the members of other clubs and the French League.</seg>
<seg id="67">Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in last year's season was, too, with the new PSG have moved to the next stage.</seg>
<seg id="68">It shows how a 1. League of amazing.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as though PSG in all relied on the performances of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that it is said that there is "Zlatanovi".</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful and that gives a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Because of this, he came here and proves she's the star of the 1. the League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where passed, prove to be a great player, the world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our team we respect the man and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He respects the people around you.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has accomplished is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This has led others to improve their own level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is among the best defenders in the world, also allowing others to grow side by side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How you Euro 2012 with the French representation?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I wanted to play in this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, due to injury, I couldn't play the way I would have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="84">But I have experienced this and I came out of it stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I was getting and in representation of the play good matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">And I had hoped since its entry to the team.</seg>
<seg id="87">We learned a lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe to ourselves, to our demeanor exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">As you look at the first of the month Didier Deschampse at the helm of the national team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">For him, the results of the talks.</seg>
<seg id="90">In qualifying at the World Championships, we're in a good location.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach chooses the players around them, and can get excited for the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">This was also Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't want them to be compared.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had reached his goal that we qualify for the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Is a draw (1: 1). October in Spain a solid starting the game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gives us added confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">We all fought for the team.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanks to Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on central banks, identified the cost of processing transactions and among the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="3">How, in the context of these technologies often true, there is a feeling the apparent political views: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pen name), presents how virtual money (However, convertible into dollars, euros, etc.), so a secure transfer protocol like Bittorrent, which allows you to Exchange files between pairs of partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand Web pages already adopting bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Course bitcoinu first reached a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $ 2, now moves at the border for about ten dollars (an overview of the courses can be found on the page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison with the world in Exchange for real money or financial products it's nothing impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) for interests of this fact in its report on the virtual finance that came out in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin describes as a "virtual money", "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "analogous to the ordinary cash".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is from other types of virtual money is different in that it is like "credits" that are used to process in the video game, which one gets the game or that you can buy (and sometimes even back to replace).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Social networking site Facebook has also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each month, but the central body checks and processes the individual communication.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoinu, all network nodes to the depositary book current accounts, supervisors, issuers and buyers as well as sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this site work?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses by using e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">The user may, however, choose a different address for each payment, which provides anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information associated with this transaction is electronically signed with a double key encryption system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the legitimacy of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of a file, you can ensure that the exchanged bitcoiny existed in the common accounts book public, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key lies in the writing phase of this new transaction to this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">By using the mathematical task solving specified computers, whose principal investigator, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a phase cutting file; i.e.. on the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computer "will take over" this new transaction and added to her number, then all "cut it".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find a number that provides a particular fingerprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number is found, the other nodes can easily check its accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then connected to a display string unsinkable all other transactions; any adjustment would be to change the impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wanted to pay twice the same fraud money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network may be confirmed only one of the two transactions-the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different imprint.</seg>
<seg id="29">A computer that will solve the challenge, win 50 bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided in two on a regular basis, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited number of 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionth, making room for mark-up is here ...</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the task also increases with increasing levels of calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network already has experienced its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Websites that provide services for Bitcoin were infected and there has been a theft of stored bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The flaw is not being used by the log itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded the company, for the payment of Paymium real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering with this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this problem also applies to cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">Notable players as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like blogging platform WordPress, is accepted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, recently analyzed the book and current accounts showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů is not orbiting.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November have been launched "huge discounts".</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars have changed," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the transformation of bitcoinů on gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books relating to these funds, has a great deal of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to the credit card (real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment of mobile phones, but uses a system of authentication for transactions, Bitcoin which are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, the wearer maintains its identity, and can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to set up, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just give the address, that can be a telephone "ofotografovat and recognize", explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and transition to horizontálnějším systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before, it will take the Bitcoin it'll take time, but the year 2013 could be decisive," predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In addition, in its report, the ECB assumes that a reassessment of the various risks, which are today considered to be increased if this kind of money is going to be successful.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Mohamed Morsi embarked on another hand of Poker.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains in its history the most divided due to the publication of the Constitution, which he temporarily granted unlimited powers, decided to play.</seg>
<seg id="4">Announced Wednesday, regardless of the opinion of all the other, that the constituent Assembly will approve the final wording of the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago by the head of State of this Assembly of another two months to complete the necessary work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For nearly two years, Egypt uses a provisional text, which has been amended many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to a by guessing.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative is only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the perspective of opposition the President lingers in his "autocratic delirium" is no longer "violates his word" and "tramples on the right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His supporters, however, make sure that it is a means to turn around as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and to speed up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Two weeks later, a referendum should be held.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short period of time, which will force the brotherhood in Egypt to withdraw from the plan text to clarify the article after article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the President it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country like a prolonged protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the people of Egypt before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I'll have unlimited powers" that would otherwise have come to an end after the approval of a new Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this particular air yesterday, 85 members of the constituent Assembly with a large majority of the text was approved by the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of Liberals in voting.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly after the publication of the Constitution, to shoot the doors that do not have the opportunity to promote their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities, the same step.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning in a hurry or not accompanied by 11 persons from among the alternates.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise then, that the articles of the Constitution have often been voted into unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes that day about ... hours for prayer, when some members of the Committee believed that the clock in the boardroom is not properly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Text, which voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Subject to the General attention, article 2, remains in the end is the same as the version of the Constitution of 1971, stipulates that "the principles of Sharia law is the main source of law".</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafi parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, they were hoping to replace the term "principles" the term "rule", which would allow for a stricter application of the.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, in turn, the fact that this article has not been repaired, is a sign of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy", argue the Liberals who see this as just a rhetorical problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, namely the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They focus in particular on article 220, which confers on the al-Azhar University, a consultative role, in particular for the control of compliance of laws with Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist on Egypt's disturbing Pommierové Sophie because "persons called to express are not chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see the beginnings of theocracy ".</seg>
<seg id="32">Concerns of Liberals even more stirring up the fact that the next Rector of the University should be less restrained than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For the moment, did not show any specific religious consequence.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, Egypt remains a general civic State.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but University workers, many of them studied in French schools, "soothes fears Alexis Blouet, which prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">Agrees, however, that "there may be disagreements about the interpretation of article 220 because it used terms belong to the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is, in particular, the reference to "fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence, note red.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future, you may experience the question of to what extent they are civilian judges competent, to be able to express themselves ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday approved the text, in addition to religious sites very criticised due to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that it was a significant restriction compared to the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the army will not carry out the verification of the defence budget in Parliament, but the National Defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also not in military courts with civilian control is disabled, as it called for the Association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These associations referred to in connection with the text, which is directed against the freedom of their doubts.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy and insult is retained, it is still disabled, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, in particular for printing.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no article does not address the protection of women, Heba Morayefová the Organization stresses the Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, is the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word is not mentioned in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President had to leave last night in a televised speech this afternoon, the rallies are scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of State will demonstrate on Saturday.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">While MEPs and human rights defenders still debating the law on compulsory language tests in the country have already discovered the cheaters who are selling "counterfeit" certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year, arriving 13 million foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their sole purpose is to earn enough money to support families at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On 1 January 2002. December entered into the effectiveness of the law, according to which the migrant workers will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">FMS, however, promises that over time the tests mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the tests will consist not only of linguistic knowledge, but also from Russian history and introduction to law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will also be necessary to attest to the acquisition and extension of a work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are not subject to this law, or people who have successfully managed to achieve certification and earn an academic diploma in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Benefits, the conviction and the protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">A network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin Russian language Institute, the University of friendship among peoples, Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants can take exams in all cities; today in Russia is already opened more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Initiative to support the introduction of testing often supported by members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law entered into force, many human rights defenders were able to ask the question: in the press and what it actually bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes the obligation to be familiar with the language for the Russians and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For one thing-the representatives of the migration service-match will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of "slave labor."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people today are talking about protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Chairman of FMS of Russia Viktor Sebelev in Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">Protection of their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of organized recruitment of 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems arise with emigrants without occupation, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without knowledge of the language-says with conviction-Sebelev is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with rogue people, who under the guise of assistance shall ensure "voucher" to the terrible, tight places to stay, in which he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents, and to work for 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our migrant workers, we get a lot of complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In their homeland by promising them one, but upon arrival they get cheated, is to keep belts, are not paid the promised wages," the head of the main Tajik labour migration management MS Tolib Šaripov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Don't Scold!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, recognize that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to get, but do not have experience even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not so much their fault, but rather disaster: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to raise at least adequate basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families need also to feed the kids something, not to mention the fact that they should be decently dressed, put the boots on and equipped for school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children mature into working life, it must be at the first opportunity to go to work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without knowledge of the language is hard-admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Do you feel the humiliation and inferior."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that with regard to the law on language tests point out human rights defenders on one very important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be implemented only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have it, so they don't even take exams, or get any other official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, she lives the majority of migrant workers as well as ever in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the arriving workers argue that gain official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reason-bureaucratic obstacles and all the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Legalization in addition costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But a false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Employees of the Russian police know that we have a basically false documents, without registration, and this provides cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea,"-he shared with reporters about their experiences, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, don't be stingy, get yourself a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of validity of the law on language, it was found that fake documents migrants are not just for registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">FMS staff already confiscated several fake certificates of passing language tests.</seg>
<seg id="48">Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, to the new owners do not come for free: each of the migrants in the hope that you will help with every problem tests, paid for this document is seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is a two and a half times greater than the official passing test: the migrant workers will cost three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption in order to get workers could simply buy documents, this is the same government officials and human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="52">Government authorities, meanwhile, promise can foreign workers who haven't mastered the tests the first time, the time required to have completed Foundation course of the Russian language.</seg>

<seg id="16">The main channel is five, says retired Colonel Victor Baraněc, who has worked for ten years at the Ministry of education and the General staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot pages that accept orders weapons</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first of them-"an army or military way", that is, a weapon that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Russian officers and stole Weapons and themselves Caucasians," says Baraněc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another type of "black" are the weapons stolen by criminals for representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of law enforcement agencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal "mainly" to receive into sales from military warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military warehouses often leads to explosions.</seg>

<seg id="27">Another source of "black" market is contraband.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is their production, sometimes there are weapons manufactured in malovýrobě, and the mafia, which was organized by their continuous production," explains the former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where is the gun?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">So experts, what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal arms to the "black" market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this subject prepared by the Center in 2011, problem analysis and designing of public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists to examine the statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian statistical agency, kriminologickou literature and public data portals focused on weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, comes from the military and executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market was "the fault of official agents, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons from the armed conflict, in 14% of cases there was a theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is "black".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Salesman-consultant one of the arms deals, which asked us to never mention his name, believes that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archeology" a long time ago-nobody is buying are just too old.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Work on the register of establishments "McDonald 's" passes up to a quarter of all American teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, in America picked up the wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Walmart and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as the "McDonald 's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy 's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave of converts to the ninth wave, or whether she is fated to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This entire share support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the modest salaries, they receive the rank and file workers in Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, is the goal of the organizers of the protests to achieve in them creating in their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade-union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week after a day of Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when America struck orgy cheap sales, has gripped millions of inhabitants and in some cases were accompanied by even brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day some workers the company Walmart that works around the world to 2.2 million people, leaving their workplaces and demonstrated together with the trade unions and left-wing activists, commercial chains of multinational companies whose goods are addressed to people of the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all over the world everything from diapers through a hunting rifle and a car battery to the vacuum cleaner, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores are on average about 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, many low-wage employees in the stores Walmart purchases only in her work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and range of goods made from a string of Walmart, one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of critics can afford to sell goods at Walmart so cheaply partly because few pays its workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automated trucks or hand-held scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators of "Black Friday," demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance rose sharply from from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical worker Walmart getting 9.5 dollars an hour, but this does not correspond to the height of the expenses, the employees say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase the average wage at $ 12 per hour, it will cost the company $ 3.2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is, on average, 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company Walmart moves fully on the shoulders of wage increases, consumers will each visit in-store only about 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as customers spend about $ 12,39 more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Defenders of the company Walmart have pointed out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" in the stores of the company lasted from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time the company Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, the box office was "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The company official Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post Web site-centric, that jobs have left a total of "less than five" employees of Wal-Mart, and that the protest was "all other media sensation", organised by trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Vacant cash register!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim are not department stores Walmart (the ones in the pokrokovém city are not very popular, and therefore almost do not), but the "McDonald 's" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then you or not be paid sick leave and does not pay you for your hard work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for their work, in accordance with federal law and with the laws of the State of New York $ 7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fastfoodové restaurant this salary increasing progressively, but only slightly, and, on average, receive their rank and file workers in New York City $ 8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city, no less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employment for "McDonald 's" can get away with almost a quarter of the American teenager, who work behind the counter after school on a part-time basis and they live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only a few people in it as their main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">At present, constantly meet in an interview with the staff of "McDonald 's", who complain that they must live off of that money, and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand on the Forum Wall Street Journal hang comment, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protest, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday for "McDonald 's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks in fast food companies began to receive at least $ 15 per hour, which is more than double their current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also demanded that in the realm of fast-food outlets have been set up trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.s. laws prohibit the Administration prevent the establishment of trade unions and trade union activists to punish through bullying and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">From the other side to manage them rarely makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">To introduce fast-food enterprises, trade unions, however, is complex and for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is the extremely high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The Opposition Of The</seg>

<p>
<seg id="46">In this day of noisy protests also were held in a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the event was at noon for "McDonald 's" rally near Times Square, where he had several local democratic politicians, in particular, Jumaane Williams City Council Member, who said: "McDonald 's", says it sells billions of servings, and then you or not be paid sick leave and does not pay you for your hard work! "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The protesters see also support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to get together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve fair remuneration for their work and economic prosperity, it deserves every New Yorker!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As it was described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food realm.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though by no means all of them were fast-food employees in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"So far, on average, to deceive the brains"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Among the fans of modern technologies of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; the last time it means to perceive the world, in particular through a special Prism glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Conference, Google demonstrated a working model of this news, and in November it was announced that the application for the patent, Microsoft also filed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">From an interview with the head of a group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge lab Šaramem Izadim Microsoft implies that for scientists of this company are the glasses of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">Luring is the prospect of handling virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">-Tell us please outline what is involved in your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">-We deal with the interactions between man and machine, but at the same time we're trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mankind so far, gets stuck in the stage of working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes no more than a finger touches the screen.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are looking for 5-10 years in advance and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensor-this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without the Kinect sensor, because for all is a very interesting possibility of control via gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">-What is waiting for us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">-Not to mention that Kinect has delegated to a natural level of interaction, a great many of the interactions is still in progress on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">Input to improve the flow of information (system receives a greater amount of data), but the output flow while not particularly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We're trying to change it, we're working on a truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">You must let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much better form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place-to hell with those silly wearing virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">-What do you think about voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a popular thing, but nepřeceňuje?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">-Of course it cannot be considered a panacea-there is the question of privacy, because not always we want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not about sweeping, only such skoupých, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gesture would nesnímala camera device, but the bracelet that tracked the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far is great, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In General, however, that the future of the joint control type, such as gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">-And how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">-For example, you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say that and show at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">-I usually just talking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">-Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">-So you want to force the user to adapt to what at any given moment may or may not machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">-It is not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human response.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors, which provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">-If you have to talk about their work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for a modern camera?</seg>
<seg id="37">Today is not sufficient resolution, depth, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">-Basically the current generation-that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the 3D detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course it would be good to obtain 8 Megapixels at a rate of 1000 f/s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it's not just about megapixels, but as an array and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">While looking at the thing are all current technology for us non-přidělává the work of designers of algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to bear in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also from.</seg>
<seg id="43">So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movement is quite dynamic and simultaneous data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a bit low, especially for the gesture.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, the work was very helpful the equivalent of such a device, only I don't need so many touches, but I need some kind of frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">-And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">-Kinect are now used three "camera", one of which is in fact an infrared transceiver and receiver-signal second reflected.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera-this is actually a current sensor of the visible zone.</seg>
<seg id="51">She is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse, because it would have increased the volume of carried out necessary calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect play with the curve of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">-If I recall correctly, Microsoft (apart from Google) publicly presented himself not wearing his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">Don't you think that when it comes to daily use of augmented reality technology by using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">-Of course, walk and constantly while keeping the hands upraised smatphone is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful variant would be "portable" form of the extension of the reality, when it would be possible on the basis of the clouds of the glasses to anytime switch smartphone, projection screen and all round.</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses-it is a very personal device, that's their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time weakness-augmented reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">-Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual hologram objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in "Iron Man", as well as the current No.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one issue on which critics often point out: there is no touch response.</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands do not feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What your group is preparing response to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">-In his lectures often say that augmented reality-this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in mutual interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the addition of tactile sensations you could become the eighth breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">So far, uses one of interesting tricks-using second hand as a certain type of substrate for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="66">In an outstanding fashion records depression!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding hmatatelnosti to these "paintings in the air"-for example, interference of several directional ultrasonic beams in the defined point where the finger tactile sense, but it's still a very weak-as if you were blowing on the ball of the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also a bracelet on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in your fingers-also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">-Have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think, to feel what it seems at the moment should feel when they see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">-It is a good idea that we haven't tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is yet another challenge, which will be fought for a long time-how to get a man who is physically located in a very confined area, he believed that an open, virtually infinite space-we're also working on the concept of cross-country skiing tracks (not at all, such as in clubs), moving platforms, and also the huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, so there is still work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive for researchers-many things are in the early days of the ABSOLUT.</seg>

<seg id="8">Cyril Miller-this is a striking man of the St Petersburg of the avant-garde end of the 1980 's. and the beginning of the 1990 's. years.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, it is the urban man, his appearance on the streets gives the smile on the face of citizens, increasing all mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently picked up a barrel organ and became the Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with all my Bohemian life, philosophy and image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">-Cyril, why so you go around town dressed all in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">-I chose a red color as the designer engaged in appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemakerem and the public.</seg>
<seg id="14">Though it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the gray, aggressiveness and awaken the wrong properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are aimed at making the interview has been made.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my provocative acts is first and foremost an invitation to debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">-And when you have to realize that you have to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">-At the exhibition in culture House on Nevsky Avenue, where they were exposed to my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understand what is my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the wave crossed the old free unofficial artists and new types of artists, free I could not understand.</seg>
<seg id="21">I made friends with the artists of the new wave, post-gazoněvskými, who brought us the "Puškinské 10", and other waves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Attracts me to the theater, clothing, music, all genres except words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">-And it all into your art-clinic ...-For me it was important to be in the center of Saint Petersburg, where the culture should gather all the best forces of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I was awarded a place on Puškinské 10, and there even before reconstruction, there was a musical-Art Club, Bohemian Club, home of the petěrburkské of Bohemia.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how the Cord with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".</seg>
<seg id="26">Lines and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, midway between them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the band started playing live, "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg led many programs hali-galivských times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have given them, the Trachtěnberga began his United career, basic education and vocational training has received from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Gallery "D 137", Club "Griboyedov-this is the echo of the Art Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">This way they left our working and permanent guests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000, he organized the survey was in the press, the special price was "People in our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "artist of the year" I was appointed, I ended my top.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the new times under the old rules the work is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you may be popular, but not too much cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">-Your works are characterized by an identifiable way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">-Many of my images-these are the hits, in which the live captured the topicality and incisiveness.</seg>
<seg id="39">I have the programmatic exhibition "Russian Museum of clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless categories.</seg>
<seg id="41">Previously, I used to be sociable, today be accompanied is painful and terrible.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the clowns are all blurs, picks up the tragika.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love of the grotesque, had some kind of grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, to save the world by totalitarian nařizovacím in disguise.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today people meet under clothing, focusing on the external drive, but on the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or maybe he can't shake hands and has to spit in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the fallacy of change will be deleted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">-Recently we saw you in the role of the organ grinder.-Cultural City should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">And who would it be, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">-And may be commercial art beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">-At present it should be commercial, utility art thorough, considerate, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">Decomposition of cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Previously, people gathered in bunches, La Bohème loved one, free from other people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today, everything broke down on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very hard to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I'm not stodolarová note, I liked them all.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today you need to think who is zalíbíte.</seg>
<seg id="57">Today, everyone has a cultural hero of 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Stasu-A few thousand viewers comes Mikhailov!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">-For him to come, there will be engaging fans sexually social sphere.</seg>
<seg id="60">And the cultural soil comes 300 people and 10,000 of them to come, and as a result there is less management, money, all languishing.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have fans, the main thing is that there is no one can't fool and will not infringe, that is changing.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I painted such pictures that hung on the wall of collectors, along with Falkem and Larionovem.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the images in which people mostly ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, people often confuse the terms.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say: the culture of spiritual culture consumer.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no consumer culture, it is from somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing of images.</seg>
<seg id="68">And I have for such a culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">-Cyril, Saint Petersburg is the lack of what?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">-Good experts in culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such a concept: the officer had through culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">Not all of them can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">During the fair it was not the tsars in everything, maybe too along with the culture Czars, but understand that there is a need to promote the real experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow today are good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our country we have people in St. Petersburg, who might be experts, but they are shadowy figures in the corner somewhere, because they are great professionals who need to properly appreciate these experts and bring them on the correct path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Today is the vkusovština.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but differs from it by honestly say that not everything modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for another Museum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">-What is your Petěrburk?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">-Petěrburk-this is not a capital of culture, Moscow is much more culture, there is the right soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our úhoru the art of doing miserably.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural land, but is now with us writers over readers, this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, the very many people who are curious, who like to walk on exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">The US is such a layer is just weak.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need to make art became a fad, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is implemented by means of a grant St. Petersburg</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">At the output we get absolutely normal bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find a foothold, it must stand on its own feet and begin to move," says head of laboratory of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If you do not find a foothold, the birds fall down doing somersaults and chaotically.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June of 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="44">Father of the child was also a Vostok Nikolajev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, he was born the son of the second wife-kosmonautce Světlaně Savické, which was visited by orbit twice and that she also worked in the open space.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Hydrolaboratoř-is a mandatory stage in the preparations for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in conditions of zero gravity, astronauts's embrace habits needed to work in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water simulates weightlessness.</seg>

<seg id="54">Small ichtiandři it seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between the fact that the child is present at an average of 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and it is then easier for them to adjust to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, it is logical, because from the time of birth, from the moment that first swim, only takes about 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It's a very little on it, that the child has forgotten something," says instructor swimming of newborns Marina Aksenovová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short-if it is for a newborn baby, a more natural state of weightlessness for women is a natural inevitable gravitation, attractive force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In a State of weightlessness occurs very quickly to the decline of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreases the body's ability to expel the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">We can leave aside, if they perform activities of promoters of the muscles during delivery.</seg>
<seg id="61">After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a Special Chamber, in which the body of the mother for forcing product.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And what else?" asks Valeri Polyakov complex issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If it is not on the body causing gravity, cannot correctly form a skeleton, or a set of muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">Newborn to orbit is not possible as an adult to wear a special suit with loads, in which he could train.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just will be deprived of what is essential to its development needs.</seg>
<seg id="67">"If you go to the experiment, which will admit the birth of a child in a foreign environment, deliver on the ground, a disabled person who is going to be absolutely non-customized ambience," predicts head of Commission for Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="68">So childbearing in the universe today is just a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">Once, however, the time will come when it becomes a reality, and when the earth shall issue in their sailing to far-away planet, which becomes home to their offspring born in the universe.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Czech: švarcsystému Check failed due to politicians</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has in connection with public procurement good reviewers and quality legislation is lagging but in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview with now it says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct-it is what we are missing, in my opinion," commenting on the current situation of Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar findings also suggests common control of Czech and German officers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practice provides access to Petr Nečas to so-called "švarcsystému".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs bother him checks-so it is disabled or enabled?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be somehow adjusted, and if anything, that disables even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has the duty to supervise and enforce the obligations to walk," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of deputies have spoken about a joint project between the Czech and the German party, within which it was matched by the legislation on public contracts in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What specifically?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As for parallel control, which we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">To put it simply, that European legislation regulates the manner in which public procurement deal, followed by the various national legislations, and then also the practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We put all this together, and even if the check has not yet been completed, showed us a very interesting differences-in General, the legislation is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect", but the practice is in certain parameters better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Therefore, it is not enough to create still more precise rules on and on, but there is a need to pursue the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What are you actually can help this project, what it means for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such a joint control could help to stop its endeavours to refinement of the law, reduction and improve the limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy of means to obtain the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, in order to avoid the enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by lowering the limit orders, that we may not necessarily achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maybe the system is overloaded with so much "paper", that those who want to search for in that system, so you will draw much more easily than if the limit remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You're talking about domestic issues with converting public procurement legislation into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is similar to our Office, the SAO, or is it set?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What authorities regard as the SAO Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized similarly to the us, also has a College, just make up a little differently, but, in principle, both the authorities shall apply mutatis mutandis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also powers are similar to a certain extent, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the following courts and at the level of the individual Länder are the system from our a little bit different.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BERNE may control only of the federal money, represented by State resources.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are managed by the County and municipalities, there are federal-level accounting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What are the terms of the legislation, so it is easier to use than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally, I would do it without specific data I don't like comparing, however, in some respects, Germany is called the pattern, but I cannot definitely say that it is all better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is therefore even better by having reviewers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but again, I say, I do not have such a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to say, that even countries that we consider to be a pattern, are faced with a wide range of issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our Office, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As regards domestic legislation, what for your Office was the amendment of the Act on public contracts, are already somehow its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Whereas the period of validity of this amendment is quite short, so we still in the checking operations.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we do the ex-post checks, is a force to be reckoned with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We observe that so far only in the process of preparing future checks-we started our new tool "detection risk inefficiencies", through which we shine almost 14 thousand contracts, and we analyzed the being-there is, of course, those changes will be, because it changes the limits, conditions for some types of tender shall be adjusted and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Approval of the Bill, therefore, do you consider more of a contribution, or another load of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">A problem that can occur is that she rules "tighten" and can not be observed.</seg>
<seg id="40">For the operation of the previous rules are controlled by persons committed by the provider (for example, in the case of the Regional Council of the regional operational programmes) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Has the price of the law in this way climbing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I don't think so in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who are guilty of the formal misconduct that does not have an impact on decision making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how it out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us show you the way no way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs bother checks that the so-called "švarcsystému"-what does that mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is disabled or enabled?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be somehow adjusted, and if anything, that disables even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has the obligation to go to inspect and enforce the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You may say: "we will change the law, and we are going to do it", but can not say that we will do nothing like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the Act on public procurement are fairly strict rules on how to be formally carried out-which is to properly protect the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic when a lead with the best bid is barred only for formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct-it is what we are missing in my opinion.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about the fact that he has less than a month to be end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It's just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with the band The Tap Tap, we're rather fun and we say that we are the only band in the world that is able to collect enough positive energy to the end of the world, to delay or avoid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In addition, in December to organize a totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can introduce to readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A national fund-raiser, which we are planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21. at 11: 10 am in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before, 20. December from 9 pm to 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">Results will be around the time when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone about 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar comes to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally, this was probably my idea, then we all would be made together with our artist and John "pray for her.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to along with the public think about the condition of this world once we to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have created a unique collection of articles, shoes, t-shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world which you buy on www.e-tap.cz people may also support it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Tap Tap along with other performers also sang a hymn against the so-called end of the world, which is called "end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="16">Today it is very popular on YouTube, you will hear on these charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, in the end, if we get it, and there will be no end of the world ...</seg>
<seg id="18">It will sing all the artists at all three concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the same time also links the hymns in a unique live on Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The words to this song written by and starring Jesus in a clip played by Tomáš Hanák, sings in her also Xindl X ...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you get to interact with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We cooperate with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we're having a lot of charity events and concerts ...</seg>
<seg id="23">We're trying to is intensively involved in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and having fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the equipment of barrier-free training center's Studeo, already the sixth year is realized with the civic association Tap in Jedličkově Institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">For students of the Institute regularly attend Jedličkova teachers and pay them in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.</seg>
<seg id="28">Students themselves do not have the resources for teachers went on their own, we try to give them a permit in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the completion of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there will be a separate building in which we move on with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what you selected?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to build a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will Chingy, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">Full details can be found on www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are you planning any similar "bombastic action" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we will be performing at the Prague Spring Festival for the first time, so here I'm sure we will prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we'll be in the us, I would like to connect with performances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are not minimalist, yet have you performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is a group consisting of handicapped people.</seg>
<seg id="40">How these paths you can manage logistically and organizationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not so bad as it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members on the power wheelchair, the trucks must travel in the cargo hold, as well as with each other, of course, vláčíme a large amount of freight and crates with the tools ...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far, it always ran without a hitch, the CSA as well as British Airways on us were well prepared, up to the number of times I wondered.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to výjezdům, you can compare how the different barriers, public access to the handicapped, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you haven't yet met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places, where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Russia on the East, everything is still in its early days.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague is Moscow very barrier, here is still unusual for a man in the electric wheelchair itself in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is not even such common sense, as that should be used by wheelchair users prefer in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are now even civil unions, which are trying to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And conversely, what we still have to catch up with more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are plenty of things in which we are still behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the improvements and enhancements to the situation is always dependent on the pursuit of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and in Madrid is quite common, that even people with severe disabilities separately move in public, they can go to the bathroom, to the Museum, anywhere ...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not very usual that there would be a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in which we, in turn, with The Tap Tap a little in advance!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when we are both notable athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things start to change for real.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but a couple of years back what you made in 1998 to establish it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I joined as an educator in the Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to pursue.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I'm a musician myself, I play, inter alia, on saxophone, so I along with a colleague, he founded the extracurricular music group.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, over time we're saying our moderator Lada Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But popularity has come up in recent years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">We work, which is seen as essentially did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Was your goal is to make it with The Tap Tap this high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt the potential that I can do something else.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness is chock full of things where one mimics the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical in its own way, everything new is being received with caution and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">Things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of someone who sees us for the first time, is of course a pity, it's only natural ...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this is utterly useless, because people with disabilities there is no suffering from all the abandoned creatures, which we'll have to regret it.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are people who can live a full life and to develop, of course, provided that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I am saying that if something can be accessible to people with disabilities, so it's not a shift just for them, but for society as a whole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">This success was helped by the fact that you are also a strict boss, how many people have you identified?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">When we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many cases and require a certain amount of discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it's perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that it must twice a week to walk on the attend exam preparation and spend a lot of time on the road at the concerts, so is enthusiasm quickly leaves.</seg>
<seg id="79">But the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The band currently has The Tap Tap 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were its beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only a single Lavish Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open Group, people are leaving and coming, I can't stop it.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and the desire to always be with us, the door is open</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The Incheba arena will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava, Flédě gas tank with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">All three cities are at the end of the evening when telemostem links common singing songs of the band The Tap Tap "end of the world"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of multifunctional barrier-free training center's STUDEO in Jedličkově Institute in Prague in the amount of $ 25 million</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week, it was at a meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency accepted Poland as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, which is a full member of ESA was November 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994, and over the next years, participated in a number of projects of the Agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the path of Poland into space began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Flights into space with the Polish enthusiasts already before the second world war; but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, to hold a lecture and. Šternfelda in Warsaw astronomical observatory that 6. December 1933 was the thoughts of her groundbreaking work entry into the space.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thoughts of a young engineer (b. 1905) let the audience cold and after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld in 1934 received an entry in the Astronautics in France Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There the doctor Jan Gadomski (1889-1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became world known promoter of Astronautics and its contribution was awarded by one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925, was in Poland built rolling stock, which should be the dandy horse equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the design is not known and not known, nor the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the missile was to be used to start or stop the mantrip.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about the handcar are known only from the fine print.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933 the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research conducted Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Wolfkem and Prof. Mieczyslawem Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the material, it is clear that the research has come to the stage of prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of the German troops was researching interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, in the trade press suggested photoelectric fighter rockets, designed by engineer Rohoziński and in the following year published work give penalties NP.rakieta-torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba author Leliwy lotnicza i-Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects have been designed for military use of rocket motors.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all military use of rocketry projects devoted to Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which has coordinated all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of its activities, putting an end to start a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other works dedicated to the aerospace sector after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time is a mention of the company in the year 1954 the magazine's November issue, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, by Prof. m. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with the space.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time he was already spreading out projects of artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is a perspective branch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the beginning in 1956, the Polish company astronautická snažia (PTA) to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall became a full member of PTA.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">This position he held until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the PTA has significantly contributed to the development of the very successful meteorological rockets RM (give penalties NP.rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carries out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first was 10. October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Missile with dostupem 1800 metres long, was about 80 cm and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was later built an improved version of the RM-1 and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the Bledovské desert flight tests of a two-stage missile RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was long and its weight 1,4 metres was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Next release should be able to type the actual scientific work-RM-34 rocket should have a service ceiling of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the upper wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, however, further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">A descendant of the first missile type RM has become a Meteor-1 rocket under development from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length is 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Have been developed in three types (denoted by Meteor-1A,-1B and-1 c), which differ in the size of the space for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1A was a room with a capacity of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34-litre and Meteor-1 c of 0,62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum ceiling for all three types was 37 miles away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968, took place in the Aviation Institute of development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket Meteor-2 had the starting weight 380 kg, and was able to bring the payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 miles.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently built version of Meteor-2 and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">I still need to mention Poland's accession to the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of a National Committee of a VALVE in the two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also in the INTERCOSMOS programme involved in research space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second after Vladimir Remkovi interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The abolition of the law on public works is not an option.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution gave rise to a lively discussion in public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalized world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect this means that individual economic units national economic systems, is in permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the principle of free trade, and free, unfettered movement of private capital, together with the unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the considerable differences work, prices (wages) to the price.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this term is to be understood as a situation in which the manufacturer is trying to import low-priced goods to compete in the competition by "screwing" price of the competitor in order to tear down the bigger share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or cheap to buy, or crease.The result is high unemployment in countries where prices are in comparison with other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for his vyprodukovanou unemployment, rising social spending necessarily state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The whole situation is a complete unwillingness on the part of business owners pay taxes and thus replace the social economic and social damage that has done in pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to indicate specific statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies, create a situation where Governments are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, Governments give to the private capital to attack its own population regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">It manifests itself primarily in the amendments to the applicable law.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to force its own population accepted price dictation of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is done on the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, as well as restricting workers ' rights in the field of labour law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase of differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany there are already many years public dispensaries food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of improving the competitiveness of the German economy is quite commonly cases regularly employed people get such a salary, that they must become subsistence pay.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was published and in the case of auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Austerity measures virtually all of the southern States, the EU no doubt lead to the same State, when people are under pressure from a disastrous decline in social standards forced either to emigrate as they did in the 19th century. century, or vegetate for the hungry wages on the edge of society in the hope that he will come to the land of private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here it should be, however, one might wonder where the but comes in?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it will be from other EU countries, poverty then moves from one country to another, or not coming at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian or African still work for a fraction of the wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies To the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and media ad nauseam argues that the State is unable to participate in the capital on their own premises that command economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private equity stubbornly insist that the State must not interfere with the economy managing interventions.</seg>
<seg id="30">You must then ask whether the private equity does not affect now actually be governed by policy and the entire State in a custom egoistickém.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is a unique answer that Yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation as reflected in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Ministry for the lack of funds to be awarded the drafting of laws to private legal firms, which are frequently used in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then reconciled in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All the power in this way does not come from the people how to preach Western-style Constitution, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that the Liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly get into a situation, as it describes the Appiános in his work the crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "the State has already long been in full decomposition and authorities occupied by force.</seg>
<seg id="38">For bribes, illegal obtaining favours and using stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption without any inhibitions and closest to the people went to the polls with sold voice "..."--people already at the Office, so that one was a consequence of the breakdown of the State eight months without consuls ". .."Indeed, began to talk about the sole and exclusive remedy in bad situation is far from that and you have to choose a vibrant man.. " While Appiános thought of the pompeion but became Caesar, which changed to take democracy to autocracy of.</seg>

<seg id="8">Some of my reasoning is supported by available historical facts, some of which are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.</seg>

<seg id="14">I write about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of Course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s. at the age of 19. in the 19th century to stop the merger of his name with the highly criminal acts, in the background and that they always meant the consolidation of power, increased wealth, or both.</seg>

<seg id="18">Anyone with this family tried to resist, he died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Central Bank of Rothschieldově Bank of America, during the civil war, began to issue its own (read Government) money, and he was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their desire for global power led in the years 1859-1871 to formulating a plan for three world wars a Freemason Supreme, 33. the degree of dedication of Albert Pike.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was to remove large monarchical State units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial estate in particular Great Britain and the third has lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere in the 0.5-1 billion people (a quantity of slaves for their comfort and the luxury of enough and do not consume so many resources), create one universal religions (ecumenism is nothing more than proximity to such a solution), and the final takeover of absolute power.</seg>

<seg id="4">For the u.s. Administration the situation does not provide a positive solution-throw the Shah of Iran across the Board she could not afford, because they would so fundamentally jeopardise the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to reach.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened fiasco attempt to rescue the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Detention of diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered the Algerian Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate at home sparked a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter's with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which was invented by an expert on the "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">That legend was credible, I remember reading about a film project in specialized magazines, there were press conferences, a fictional production company had a real Office.</seg>
<seg id="17">Details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck movie is a special combination of multiple genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time. "caper movie" the story of vydařeného piece, happy trip-an example might be a series of Danny's men.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, alternating moods-on the one hand a documentary conceived sequence from Tehran (in titling sequence are shown the iconic period photographs as well as the way in which events were the same the situation presented in the film-the large differences in that they are not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, lightened passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there's a scene of CIA headquarters and other institutions-men in suits discuss situation in meeting tables, in the corridors of the Office, on the phone ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleckovi is a remarkable way he managed to restart his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vysmívaného, the actor became a respected Director, as well as his acting has ceased to be the butt of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007), and the thriller the town (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time it is the first slide to Affleck not taking place in the Director's home in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A feel for the atmosphere of the place was between the characteristics that režisérovy older povyšovaly films over Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck him in Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, to reconstruct real events-the opening sequence fall embassies is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotion of the confusion and nepřevídatelnosti, which occurs when they move out of the history somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect of Affleck and his collaborators are in the scenes of fictitious (fake crew on teheránském Bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many processes on too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The Director had to deal with the fact that story does not actually much suspenseful scenes in the movie sense.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully with it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí-there all so elegantly comes out (the scene in which the impending crisis in the teheránském airport turn away a phone call in America and chase after the runway is pretty far fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weakness of the ARGO's distractibility resulting from the need to show too many processes on too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles Hollywood associates a very playful, their figures should, however, have more space and are not in the movie is far from the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleck movie kind of losing a dramatic stroke, it's a snapshot, which you can track with a slight concern, to appreciate the implementation and retro style reminiscent of the thrillers of the 1970s. years.</seg>
<seg id="37">Sweeps away but a hard time.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of one yet in a way, living history and proof of how exaggerated are the images of všemocných and vševědoucích of the secret services, but it is sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="54">I went for the Jančurou, Radim due to the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">So I at least support the investigative journalist John Lorencovou, which rozkrývala scams with light heating oils.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I ran with the fact that people are really uncomfortable, but now I'm having second thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people not to vote and those who have gone, mostly chosen representative of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">We in the Senate only two independents.</seg>
<seg id="59">People navolili the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, I will fight for your vision, such as the direct election of mayors and Governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Are you thinking of setting up his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought about it, because I don't have time to check the net past any potential straníka, and I don't have the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20 thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You do not have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You're talking about equity returns, what's yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Private property would be about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I have a plot of land about 25 million, ten million, an apartment for another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, amounting to 3.5 million Aston Martin and Skoda Superb in a million, and then I have a few million in the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way I have a Aston Martin because it was my dream from childhood-I always liked James Bond, who was in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time he fought against by and nešvarům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do you drive an Aston Martin, do you have a thing for 60 million and you do not have the money to campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">Are you saying that you want to change, but the actual money you don't want to give too much.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very compelling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">It got into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I bumped into a campaign already 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I don't have any sponsors, attests to the fact that my program is not such an interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I have no obligation to pay from your campaign.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign basically covers what I will receive senátorský salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But he would like a job, for example, I was unable to pay the son of an English-language school, which costs 30 thousand per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So you'll continue to do business, so you could live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Didn't you say that pressing these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it has nothing to do with the amount of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, I partially canceled its activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the Director of travel agency in the spring become my Deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would want me to be a good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need something to live with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much have you as an entrepreneur was used to get a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure is located just in the head-for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain books-2 images</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"The building seems cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, it is something interesting to see again, "says Lisette Verhaig, that goes around the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a large firm, says: "of course, this House is nice."</seg>
<seg id="4">I, however, I'm asking, what today we need a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">They all have internet, ipads and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Into any of these old-style libraries today, nobody goes on a voluntary basis, or Yes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, near Rotterdam, custom jobs that was not worth a visit, holds a special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">This village with 80 000 inhabitants, has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make this stupid situation resolved, the decision was made a few years ago to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted fantasy miniatures of reinforced concrete bridges, which are depicted on the euro banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of an educational offensive but he was not giddy.</seg>
<seg id="11">And Councillors so that there is only one way how to become masters of statistics: we need to have a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas of MVRDV Rotterdam architectural Studio, a master of insanely courageous column charts and one humorous, often even cynical buildings, took the thing with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the Commission still stunned looking around and crouched, shoulders, vršil free gifts on their Maas by size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear city village!"</seg>
<seg id="14">This is my proposal for a mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later the mountain for 30 million navršena.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground parking garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent homes and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November was a mountain of books is awarded second place "the Best Library of A.D. 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award for 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maloměstská gray, who still could not offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually nasty Town Hall, whose white façade, would you rather expect dairy, is richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But more importantly, has now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Long way to go to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: Reader's Eldorado under the hatch on the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Means of the mountains runs the elevator, but the real spatial and reader's passion to discover the walking control of topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">From all sides of the glass-covered interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burned Klinker bricks and elegant street lanterns clearly reflect the atmosphere of the public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play soccer.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere, books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally stand racks of books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, that's the most uncomfortable one, and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We are a classic spatial configuration built upside down and space to the reader we ran out from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Interior of the Mountains of books is skillfully used: in the middle are the Office, the library, the Internet Chess Club, the organic Center and Central plumbing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special with black bookshelves, which are one panelling, parapet railings and stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The appearance, structure and the smell is strange.</seg>
<seg id="33">Over an unknown building material to shake their heads, even the bitterest architects and construction engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We are here to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the urban municipality of Spijkenisse, on the question of the Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in one fríském the farm one day came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and fields used in the Netherlands as a base under the roots produced the fleece from synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and time efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thin fabric lasts one, two seasons and then it's ripe for being bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library was the first time in this fleece-quantity-; on the boards with a thickness of four inches.</seg>
<seg id="40">By the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns in the dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells a little bit like a new car, and a bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps leads to the top.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of almost 500 meters long wandering in the literary cafe rewarded with not only fantastic views of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and fíkusy in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">You take care of the atmosphere, but also for the correct humidity in the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Gifts for a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I did not believe it, but this House is in spite of many glass surfaces a prime project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heats and cools the Earth's heat.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although Mountain books is located beneath the glass hatch, the Sun is shining in a short time, and even in the sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">Wide laminated wood trusses, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as a shade and captures a large portion of solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very nice.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the deal fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as the "long awaited soul" Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: each of the inhabitants of the city a few weeks ago was invited to the opening, to bestow one book from your personal Fund.</seg>
<seg id="55">So should first be filled with optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently includes 70 000 units.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has worked well.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are completely filled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our invitation to the new House now has a population of each particular relationship.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is just for decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">This worked in the Royal discipline of MVRDV, which in the professional jargon says identity formation.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">However young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is ultimately a starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo, "the Germans must play a greater role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained when deciding to take Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa the Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week, first suggested that it would vote against the proposal on the observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Berlin abstention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany doesn't support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, of course, must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think it will not support nor the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence — without, of course, it was too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also delayed the vote, when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">She pushed through NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take on major international topics clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction from the policy, which has been controlled by the UNITED STATES, so to speak, in the direction of German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is all the more difficult, that Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are, therefore, between the two queues.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them, that will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think its role is only zabydlují, but are on their way to more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">To foreign policy, as in France or the United Kingdom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What specifically does "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Shows a willingness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US and European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think, that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and its relationships with certain areas, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are to some extent the non-economic interests of other powers, and must, therefore, protect their interests, Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Economic interests should influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First of all, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the States around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful that the neodstrašilo the public, but not the elites in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">It certainly plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I wouldn't want to do this but not to ascribe too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">In any case, however, it plays a significant role in German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Damaged Germany's relations with the United States, as in the case of Germany both important decisions, such as abstention in voting on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think in Europe and even in the United States is ruled by a great understanding for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">That's why I don't think it was such a dramatic turning point, as in the question of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps even benefit from Germany of a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It indicates that it must be considered to be an international player and its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, by contrast, clearly favour the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are between the United States and many European peoples differences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences existed in the u.s. as a result of internal politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has a substantial understanding of secretly European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But due to the political situation cannot, of course, hold this position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think the diversity of opinion actually aren't as great as they always seem to.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too much excited about Netanjahuovou policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany is not difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the us on one side and with the positions of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think it makes it harder for the Germans this exactly.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and integrated European policy, which is currently happening.</seg>
<seg id="47">Cannot be part of a wider line and must instead take things forward on its own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">It's just they are doing with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe toward the European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Germany, of course, is not easy, because of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It has always been a touchy subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as a major international player? He wants to take over the lead role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still not on it yet, it's still annoying, and for this country is for obvious reasons still hard to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role, protiněmecké mood.</seg>
<seg id="57">It's easier to the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this perspective, Germany in a much more difficult position than the us.</seg>
<seg id="60">It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of the US in European politics now has steadily decreased, however, the EU is currently this vacuum does not fill. Who else is there?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans simply will have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they don't like it, it is annoying and makes it even more neoblíbenějšími-c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"The protection of brands" in China: when the Puma and Armani at the same time, the Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a designation that is officially registered in China completely, but with the original company has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shall enjoy protection, however, as long as it is nezažalují real brand owners.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear whether the making of the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners in China to protect its brand," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of rights in the far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week it lands on my desk in the new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Counterfeiters have a few extra letters, so that they can log on their brand.</seg>
<seg id="10">From the brands Gucci, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada have their register instead of the Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, are legally copied and the German company, sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a binder with the trademark office records in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">September 14, 2010 there's left one Chinese company to protect the brand name of Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that acts as a parasite on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are the world champions in the copying and infringement of intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities are in a multilevel shopping malls, which are almost exclusively sell fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochovy cases are different. On behalf of its clients shall proceed against Chinese companies received from the Trademark Office officially completely right to use the mark, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", associated with the brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word focuses on "Bang is Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">This meant women who hunt the rich man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It harms the trade, we have to deal with," invites Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Mark is diluted, the exclusive position disappear, damage to image is huge."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and legal costs the affected industries are in the millions, particularly for precious sample products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data from market research company CLSA China with a volume of eur 15 billion per year, the third-largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="25">Deletion of the offending record in the register marks can be difficult to achieve, however, and it is worth something.</seg>
<seg id="26">Management can stretch for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells of cases where the Court has rejected the claim, because the name was vytýkaný after a long duration of the "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If complaining party has bad luck, it must still pay the plagiátorovi, because of the damage its brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Known cases of concern as well as graphical elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">Daimler lost in 2009 legal dispute with the manufacturer Sany construction machines, undertaking, which recently took over the German manufacturer of the pump Putzmeister concrete mix.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese are approved to use the logo, which is similar to the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">Company Geely bought Volvo, which originally used the blue and white logo, which resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.</seg>
<seg id="34">Manufacturer fashion goods Lacoste in China lost to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who the famous crocodile turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the CTMO Trademark Office acknowledges that there have been shortcomings in 2010 due to the too small number of staff and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year, supposedly "the progress of the work process returned from emergency situations to normal".</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of outstanding opposition declined by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Matched was 57 000 such cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still waiting for the Office still 81 500 complaints pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Something to do is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is the case in China, often, they're impressive numbers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year there were delivered to the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of marks, which is almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">That's a record, and it means that for the tenth time in a row, China leads the list of new applications around the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is also true for the number of all valid trade marks-there are a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">To put it simply, this means that on average each login is 1280 Yuan or € 160.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To start a dispute against it is a multiple of, as shown in the case of a German family company Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">This concern has been more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans may have been canceled by its illegal production of automotive parts imitovaných.</seg>
<seg id="51">But forger clinched China's rights to the mark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">We have neglected themselves, as in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanna Wentzler, President of the leadership of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">CTMO Trademark Office also is opposed by the Munich firm has rejected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In two other instances, Freudenberg, gaining the defendant in the lawsuit fights on this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">You need to be a horrible warning</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">It is now a matter pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has confidence that the case would lead to a good end, and praise the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: "control is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company having to even look at a hundred-year-old writings, to submit evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago the company Freudenberg counterparty in vain offered "high šestimístnou amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"You see what it means to us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is a risk from the far East and Europe hits.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the case when there's imitators ensure unprotected brand.</seg>
<seg id="64">One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign mark Freudenberg in Germany for the footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of business concern, but gave up a long time ago was able to stave off the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It should be give a terrible warning," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and a lawyer advising German Pattloch businesses to trade with China were very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international trademark law. Foreigners would rather they had "everything that in any way is worth the protection log, as well as in China," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can be much more expensive than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if Freudenberg in the last act of his drama with the mark falling, then I would have to pay royalties for the non-proper name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we'll be in the segment pushed out of the market.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">First, there's the foot-stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's shoes and men's moccasins on the dance floor looking for tact and quickly found it.</seg>
<seg id="5">One-two-three-four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then slowly vzedmou the voices of singers-Alto, bass, tenor and soprano-pressing, is bright and prosecutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it almost rises from its textile shoes, when combines with voices vláčně wild gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday night. In the Music Hall of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg tested choir Imbongi new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from human genetics, including the caretaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">' Om ' Obani "is not an easy song, each backing voice has a different text, and also in a very foreign language-zulu spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help to self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that worldwide live roughly 34 million people who are infected with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 23.5 million live in southern Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after their parents who have died of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphans after their parents who have died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni Association Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attending school second degree.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over the sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guarantees the child's tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in a Gogo-Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in the language of the zulu "storyteller" or also "the one who extols".</seg>
<seg id="21">Gas bantuštinou fails in this area, no one to talk to, just sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For nearly ten years the choir is rehearsing songs in this alien soft speech and sometimes also brings back where it originally came from: South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the great circle distance 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in the northeast of the Kingdom of Svazijského village Esitjeni, which depends on the cardinality of the votes of the German congregation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected with</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple mud or straw huts where. A large part of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them no longer has a parent, as the latter succumbed to HIV.</seg>
<seg id="27">At Esitjeni is seen in miniature, the sick across Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infikovanosti, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Male circumcision of the foreskin, which reduces the risk of infection by half, the population does not accept.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carries a virus weakened immunity. It is no rare thing that die in less than thirty years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This village discovered the choir to the common journey through Africa in spring 2005. In particular, many of the children have seen Imbongi members on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without complete school education in a poor country had absolutely no chance.</seg>
<seg id="32">At first it was private individuals that deployment for a couple of euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But a year later was founded by choir "Voices for Africa", which has since old about orphans after their parents who have died of AIDS, almost professionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">To bacterial SPI belong to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral STI, HIV, Human Papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crabs and scabies include parazitárním to SLEEP.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to the group most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea is found mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis to, that have been reported in Germany, are transmitted by sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">For heterosexual adults are sexually communicable diseases that occur often, chlamydial infection, trichomonad, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and Human Papillomaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is between heterosexual adults in our expanded relatively little, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV is accounted for by this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among adolescents with chlamydial infection occur significantly more frequently than other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European studies, three-fourths of all infections involve young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, the US among adolescents frequently Human Papillomaviruses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How developed the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 disease in 2001 more than doubled on 3698 diseases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of people newly infected with HIV in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 has been approximately 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is roughly one-tenth of less than a year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms point to venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, difficulty in urination, vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and pustules or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore will remain nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect yourself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Risk of infection can reduce the condoms, however, do not offer 100 percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As the originators of the sexually transmitted diseases may be partially transmitted and infections from impurities and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend, in particular, in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, routine examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis it is possible to cure most of the SPI and avoid later consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least, the honorářům choir's singing earns all across Germany, gather some money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total we have sent to the Esitjeni roughly eur 200 000," says Chair Annette Lennartz.</seg>
<seg id="63">Money from Germany managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who can push through.</seg>
<seg id="64">It also takes care to orphaned children have found shelter, for example, for some of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo language, zulu says old women are the mainstay of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them even took 14 orphans, had given them a roof over their heads and they take care of the children arrived every day in uniform in time for school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Children who do not have anyone to go to the shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman, paid by the Federal Government as well as two cookbooks, cooking each day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">"Voices for Africa", established the school of sewing, pitted two henhouses, and together with the American health organizations had DOGS that many people in the village had to do a test for HIV.</seg>
<seg id="69">It's not a matter of course. Although the disease is apparent throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The King has 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually pretty strange in a country where the King officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch in Africa, black King Mswati III is known for his nemírným lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy rather than democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This state-approved way of life also, inter alia, bears the blame for this, that the HIV virus in the past decades and spread rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But many migrant workers who spread the virus.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is in use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Culture is different-open intercourse. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To at least somewhat supported cultural exchange, traveling choir Imbongi once every two, three years after South Africa together and singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent is known from the times of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white people, who sing the songs in the speech of blacks-such awards brings not only the mood and pleasure, but also for many tears vyloudilo wild frontier troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The path always leads to the Esitjeni, where the singers visit children, over which the sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although this village is unlikely to find on maps, in the Valley of the river Ezulweni is more than well known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go to the Esitjeni, there is light," say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when you return to Heidelberg, which is as the crow flies from here to dupajícím kilometers 8733 singers Bergheimer Straße in service on the, you can see that the light is shining here, too.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Telescope allegedly invented the year 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei one year later, it was used to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew-and views that they are getting deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The largest telescope in the world has been around for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope on Palomar Observatory near San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="54">Mirror in this picture had a diameter of five metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In the u.s. State of Arizona is the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">Allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 m.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="58">Mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to congestion costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Still, its diameter is about 11 metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of a cheap method of construction: the telescope is provided hákovadlem in the high angle, which limited his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">In elevation angle is fixed and the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its special feature is the high gain of the luminous flux.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is in spite of the relatively small diameter of the mirror makes up the largest mirror five world.</seg>

<seg id="64">Using the radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) in the universe, scientists searching for extraterrestrial signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI)-the search for extraterrestrial intelligence-can help every owner of a computer, which will give you the available computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at his Observatory European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is a Very Large Telescope-and it does honor to its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">This telescope with a total of four mirrors can prosvítit even the middle infrared spectrum.</seg>

<seg id="74">They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">Keck Observatory Mauna Kea are included, which, besides them looks into space and use the telescope Subaru and IRTTF.</seg>

<seg id="78">The most important impressions of the universe are, however, mediated by Hubble space telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">Shots of distant worlds gives us from 24. April 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The space telescope Kepler looks since March 2009 after extrasolar planets — especially those that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">February 2, 2011 NASA announced that since the beginning of the mission it was found 1235 candidate planets.</seg>

<seg id="84">Space-based infrared telescope's primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists are based on the fact that it is led and at the South Pole of mercury.</seg>
<seg id="87">For this, however, there are no reliable figures as Messenger circling around the planet far closer to the North Pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements show for several decades on the ice on mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to probe Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit mercury, scientists now have certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Norwegian rakfisk: Most smelly fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Five million people living in Norway is enjoying one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">It might be the secret to success of the country associated with the local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a few overripe cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet soccer equipment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave it for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, smell the smell of a paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are wonderful views of the snow-hangs in the air and the ubiquitous smell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is a salted fermented trout in the water for up to one year, depending on how much you want the fish smell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As it gets dark, and starting to get cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes dating to the festival dedicated to this, how best to say it, nejpodmanivějšímu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You eat it raw, and then it zapijete a aquavitu," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "General" Rakfisk, which is responsible for the progress of the Festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people eat small fish cubes and is washed down with plenty of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people would rather have than aquavit rakfisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Beverage can smell Squish.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'll try a few pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad-it is similar to a piece of sushi that has been on a long journey by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different era, when it was in Norway, poverty, and yet because there were no fridges, fish in the fall of the hides into airtight barrels with water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, Shanthi and ate-senses are dulled by alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In front of just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their land and seek work, with the majority emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants přilákaní large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive system of care.</seg>
<seg id="22">The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, which not long ago was much richer than Norway, flows into the country for work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, even if quite smelly part of Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the more expensive dishes on the market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although expensive, it is everything-a small glass of beer or sandwich you come out at 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is the world's messages often lack-and it seems that most people that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot a 77 men, women and children, people here still refer to begrudgingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, the event is called the "shooting of the 22. July ".</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians can hardly believe in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970 's. years of the 20th century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason, why are we doing so well," says when you place your plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and startlingly blue eyes represents the epitome of nordického wealth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as you say, that sensible people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, as well as most of the English people, it is absolutely perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">Don't ... grandstand, we don't like pomp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway is treated with its gingerly oil wealth-in addition to a small percentage of it is most of the money from the industry invested in a special fund for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw the money they didn't have, the Norwegians had its purse strings firmly tightened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can go skiing in the winter and in the summer to go on trips, we're happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And eat the rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat-rakfisku I've had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">A Moose burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening it is stinking fish again.</seg>
<seg id="42">Hotel where I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk for dinner is served and where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have a connection with a live television transmission, in which the moderator with a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with the rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like singing contest Eurovision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What kind of score you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here's our scoring, Håvard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">So, too, a round of applause and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="48">Man falls from his chair, maybe quite aquavitem.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe the fumes of all those fish.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing a number of key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The goal, however, did not prevent commuting to get to work, but to prevent protesters from gaining access to the Parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto has received the presidential sash and takes over the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Facing a challenging task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico at the time of the outgoing Administration's Felipe Calderona performed well economically, however, the country is in the clutches of drug war, which has an estimated 60,000 victims took the lives of six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My Government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction in violence," said the President of Pena Nieto, u.s. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he shook hands with the u.s. President, received the President of Pena Nieta political experience as Governor of his home State in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Opinions on a new leader are different even in his old home, lidnatém and vast state surrounding the capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Straight man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo for him remember for good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Citizens attach to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now the city can be reached by one of the new motorways, which let Pena Nieto build up. These highways are a huge improvement compared to a leaky, and the uneven roads, which were previously.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plate with his name also hangs on the wall of a modern sports centre and the impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect it will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Deputy for the party of President Pena Nieta, institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, we hope in an interesting and real changes in the field of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After uninterrupted 81 years in power has been the PRI'S party pushed out Vicentem Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Member of the Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace, Los Pinos, within the party from Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">And refusing to express opposition to characterize the new President as a person without any substantial content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It's a very straightforward person, very impressed with the excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">Is a great statesman and a man who knows how to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the State, this is not the impression that has of her former Governor many people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In the Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, cannot be the contrast with its cobbled streets Valle del Bravo more apparent.</seg>
<seg id="27">Tucked under motorway flyovers in many ways reminiscent of the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And problems in the autonomous region are also persistent and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year, the army has been called in to help in managing drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly poignant is violence against women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Just in the last two years have been on the desolate places next to the vast waste land pohozeny bodies of dozens of murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">At the time, Pena Nieto was Governor, in the State of Mexico murdered more than 1,000 women, which is much higher than in the notoriously violent city Ciudad Juarez-a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the best case, critics say that Nieta Pena in his tenure in Office failed to adequately addressing the problem of murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of escapism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In the concrete House, typical for a dilapidated neighborhood, me Irinea Buendia shows photos of his deceased daughter Mariana Moon and suppressing tears.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version, she committed suicide in 2010, Marian.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived at her house, so it looked as though her body being washed, '' recalls Mrs. Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs after the strikes began, and rigor mortis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">As her mother tells the story of the visor down, Mariana from the picture on the wall, next to a cross, on which there is a single word: "justice".</seg>
<seg id="40">However, this is, as he says family, exactly what they have been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The State authorities appear to me as if I was an old gossip, potížistka and kňouralka.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want you to just accept what they say, and they were silent.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But it cannot be right, when there has been so many errors and omissions," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Sasha, the President of Pena Nieto on Saturday will receive, is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last six years, tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico and the new President has promised that for the duration of his time in Office will be its priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope it will be the same by the President, as Governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI'S Olvera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fears most.</seg>

<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of options, of which there are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; remind them to tough times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During the last trip to the capital city of Mexico, I hardly made his way through the crowd and I got into the agenda of immigrants, where I encountered a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Arrows pointing to one of the two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and one for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in Central California, and all my life I was called "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York themselves referred to as "Italians".</seg>
<seg id="10">So later I ended up in the designation "Mexican American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I don't know how to get rid of an American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out my American passport and stood in a queue for "Extranjeros".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I was thinking about the moment when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has visited President Obama in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="18">The program had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons is the same probability that the Mexicans would remain in Mexico, such as the national visa holders; to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a North American trading block similar to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto has promised that he will continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, although they did not give any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relationship with the United States, complicated and full of hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of weapons to override the half of Mexican territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans who are thinking in the range of hundreds of years, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So one minute after the representative of the United States says something just a little critical of Mexico, you'll hear in the press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans interfere with the sovereignty of its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And kids Montezumy stepping out on a war path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet it is a true challenge for Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about the hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">A lot of them.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers opportunities, and others which do not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in any point of our family tree was the person, maybe a parent or grandparent who has been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than it would seem this person fit the profile-dark skinned, poor education, origin from the poor village, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we're loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not against Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though now we are living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we've got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is on the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And in addition, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class, not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">He sees us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and should regard us as an inferior race, that is not enough Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is in their opinion only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico fail, so they never left.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we are now trapped in nenalézali silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but i still lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is a tension, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resents it.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if he is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And at the same time many Mexican Americans, that I know of, does not feel as part of either.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to Mexican groups Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteena.</seg>
<seg id="49">You will get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in one.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico on us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States are considered to be Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And to make it even more complicated relationships, they want some Mexican leaders and part of intelligence, as I learned during his trip, reconnect with the diaspora by bridging.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to keep Mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a "makeshift ambassadors" and represented Mexican interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American fellow citizens, how great is this country to visit, and push on the political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Well.</seg>
<seg id="56">So it won't happen again.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And thanks to income inequality and prevalent corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not certain, it's a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">This is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States as it did with Mexico in front of one and a half century ago, so must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignation for the manner in which it was treated with their family members in a substantially closer to the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we are more "Mexicans", than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battle, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Their fire between Israel and Hamas would still be uncertain basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such problem is in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual useless conjecture about who started it, there were many buildings changed in rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and in the Holy City of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even if it seems that the Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab spring changed the old ways, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are engaged in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe this causes their struggle will be even bloodier than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither won nor lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it appears that currently there are not many reasons for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire concluded 21. last November, the fighting this week have strengthened hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that governs the Gaza Strip since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, even if Gaza has suffered defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite killing several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the most pitiful and the most populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his bitter rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, Hamas leaders may very well lead to the conclusion that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Znovuvzkříšená Turkey, a regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined to the side of Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering the people of Hamas say the Islamic Crescent encircling around Israel from Lebanon in the North, where the party/militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can unseat Bashar Al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies are a threat to the King.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on the southern flank of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, led by President Mohammed Morsi, Egypt, by far the most populous and crucial Arab country, the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, not Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a future diplomacy can Hamas emerge as a player who cannot be expelled either Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In contrast, Israeli hardliners to run out to the opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terminology, Hamas was stored back into the crate.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's iron dome missile defense system could have a price and a lot of rockets Hamas has been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis can sleep better-for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, America is as unflinching as always. Many European countries also vinilo Hamas of starting the latest round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, that the peace process is mostly ignored.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004, killed about 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombings, bombers, in part thanks to the wall that intrudes into the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian State, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are still growing despite its illegality before international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose Likud party is at the beginning of the campaign in the election held on December 22. January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Lieberman 's, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by allowing them to have their own State?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you would really ruled the West Bank, the neodpalovali missiles, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if we hold that wall and sock 'em is when the rear of the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Hardliners might win, but the Arab spring can make their calculations change.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even though the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, do not have Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israel's defense spending is higher than the expenditure of all his four Arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly will help new Arab Governments to recover its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that President Morsi collaborated with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mean the beginning of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also, the Israelis would look at a given situation should look at in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, creating a denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination sud powder keg, which must one day erupt in areas occupied by Israel — as well as a bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Currently repression undermine democracy in the Jewish State and the situation is exacerbated by demographics, how Arab population grows.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody attacks against Gaza is held every few years for the purpose of pushing Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic toll.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both parties need to incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is what they preach reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two States, when Israel shall be forwarded to the territory because of safety concerns.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is little hope of stopping the fire from outside pressures will provide at least a little more leverage to promote this stuff.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which along with Turkey and Qatar must to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish State based on the 1967 borders with replacement of parts of the country, and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs also needs to push from the outside to match between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be for the creation of a Palestinian State has done more than the immediate offer of virtual State sovereignty at the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In his first parliamentary term, neglected to show his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back at the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia, the entry into force of the laws on nasty cigarette packaging</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are a warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Into force joined Australian laws on tobacco and cigarette packaging of ugly, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors of the markers to be replaced by General olive green stocked with packages of ugly pictures of sick with body parts and babies and newborns sick as a result of their parents ' smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the various health warning messages, and pictures are compulsory since Saturday, the only difference between brand names stocked with packages that are printed in the same small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the strictest regime in the world relating to tobacco packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian Federal Government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by his attraction to get rid of this bad habit.</seg>
<seg id="7">It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, is a 99% chance that they begin to smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even in very young children, you can see, that means the message that tobacco companies trying to sell, along with his product," says Tanya Plibersek, the Federal Minister of health, citing studies that, for example, have shown that children associate the Crown in the logo with the idea to be a Princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry against the imposition of these laws lobbied hard.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase the trading on the black market, which in turn will lead to cheaper and more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thanks to this legislation, there are serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of the company British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia they bring much more of these products, which will be sold to Australian streets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Another claim, that the laws have increased their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said demand for cigarette packaging of Silicon that is used to cover the sick boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal relating to the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that the company sold Zico nearly 6 000 pieces of wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's a good deal for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a possible hitch, experts say the popularity of social media for the demographic group that the focus of the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wide range of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and requesting that most vendors held a cigarette in front of the direct-view, tobacco marketing has moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned Internet advertising undertaken by the local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you are a marketing specialist in tobacco industry and you have only a small space for promoting your products, is for you an online space unmatched place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Ms. Freeman has seen an increase in guest brands on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, carried out the "average Honza".</seg>
<seg id="23">We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves cigarettes Marlboro and took the job and created this video, or there is involved a marketing company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia contends that the industry has focused on how it would deal with the new rules, than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking the new regulations-countries in the framework of the world trade organization claiming that the trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries has not dealt with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">The judgment is expected to be SOO in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek says that the Government has held talks with other Governments that are considering similar laws relating to packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country which in 2001 introduced a mandatory warning photos.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now have spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">More stringent laws are United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia defies.</seg>
<seg id="32">Images have no effect on me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just ignore.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I'm just pulling a cigarette box and stick it back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with pictures of a tumor in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, who owns a newsagent's King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, says that thanks to the single packs of is harder to align the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Being unloaded it took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The Government would simply be completely disable, then we said to ourselves, ' OK, this is the end, close the shop '," he said, and threw up his hands.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last Thanksgiving I've unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the arrival of the next aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had a lot of time thinking about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I'm not going to lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, in spite of the distractions, magazines and books iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on children's development of increasingly come with praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that for us (and our children) is a good idea to occasionally get bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And whereas most of us nowadays is constantly connected to the screen, we have a chance to enjoy the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We should therefore support the boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I'll be back to do so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But he says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, has a long history of boredom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii Latin inscription was found on the boredom, dating from the first century AD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The trouble is, that was defined and discussed a variety of ways, said John d. Eastwood, Professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After seeing the research literature and presentation ideas to an audience of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy, but I wasn't capable of doing this".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boring apathy from them by a person not into anything plugged in, but she wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that there is no urge to do something about apathy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that at the heart of boredom is a "distortion of the process, the attention in a bad mood and a sense of time passing slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can remind a lot of depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship to each other, they have bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, challenge yourself in the sees themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that kids will grow, if we only have difficulty concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article from a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quiet that it's barely noticed, while the third group did not hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard a TV program, reported more boredom than the other two groups had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why this problem and attributed them to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the disruption of attention lead to boredom, said Mark j. Fenske, a Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as the search is bad components on the factory line, can help with that distracting music to keep you busy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, it can really help with boredom and keep people physically fight even more jittery.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that kids who are allowed to fidget, learn more and retain more information than those that are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all sometimes boredom experienced-my flight delay, the loud speaker, especially a lengthy movie.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">For help with measuring boredom scientists in the 1980s. years of the last century have developed "a scale for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes questions such as: "a lot of things that I need to do, is repeated and is monotone," and "I have so many interests that I do not have time to do them all."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular, with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, in General, teenagers are indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, performed an experiment in which seven or eight times a day has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of teens reported that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they weren't in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom now, 21 years later, higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he said he knows that '' adolescence is a peak time for boredom ", which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: "Is boring for you good?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As research shows, sometimes not, because, in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risk, gambling played the abusive or addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is a way for the brain, how to inform you, that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always the best thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and you use this energy to playing guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you watch TV you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child is bored, and you give him an iPad, I get bored, but learn how to entertain itself or as a single drive, Professor Fenske said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "this separate control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child will learn only how to amuse itself, but gets greater self-discipline in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we wouldn't even against it should not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are away from the incessant rattle of activities and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"Prosecuting it from the need to bore you with more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the leisure time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain myself, when the noise shuts down."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado there is no Handbook on the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">19 year old Anthony Orozco, a student at the higher technical school and football player from southeastern Colorado, faces charges of criminal offences for something that will soon be in its State-legal for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which was used on her smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco said that one September day he went with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a police officer found marijuana in the car, it was Mr. Orozco issued a summons for possession of drugs and paraphernalia for drug use-minor offences for which is a fine of $ 100 for each-and he was made for the court date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They come to us as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after the coloradském vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends on the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases on the spot rather than on the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Police Department stopped blaming adults aged 21 years and older for possession of a small quantity to be legally permissible after the law in the coming weeks will come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in more conservative districts of Colorado have said they will continue with existing cases relating to marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the Western mountains to prevent votes on the opening of new, state-licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This issue is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel j. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, East of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Gossip's head as well as regulators in the State of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="14">Looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale-everything in term 1. December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most States in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now even pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a regulovanější market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian e. Smith, a spokeswoman for the Council for licensing the sale of alcohol in the State of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Mr Smith said, no space or the system could not do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent by which we can control," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law. I-502, shall enter into force 6. December, which also leaves the annual vacuum during which still does not exist a State licensing system, but legal possession.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there is an important mechanical questions that must be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the State's directive concerning "appropriate access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on the trade in cannabis up to 330 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"There will not be more difficult to place the licensed trade in hemp than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan areas of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokeswoman for the Center for legal hemp, the recently established research groups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">on November 21, he sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora to its officers email in which they announced that the city prosecutor will no longer prosecute misdemeanors for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each citizen aged 21 years and that police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the city's laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the District of Weld in Northern Colorado District Attorney Ken Buck is a stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his Office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently faces charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, though many of them face additional charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our Office is obliged to prosecute criminal wrongdoing, which were criminal offences at the time they occurred," said Mr Buck, in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was complicated in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, did not blame adults for possession of small amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">District Attorney Pete Hautzinger,, this decision supports, but also decided to nezamítnout all pending possession cases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I don't think I'm losing my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of the coloradských voters supported the measure, while recreational marijuana into the arms of Government and legal system will never be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory responses across the State have revealed with regard to this great State green experiment the deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For district prosecutors it is "a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, and the local spokesperson for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They spent so much of his life chasing people, that still cannot actually accept that it's legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The first States that a small amount of marijuana stop as to alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become a national test case for legalizing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and State authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and at the same time also anxiously awaiting instructions from the Federal Government, which still has a plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping to the Ministry of Justice gives in.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use it to get attention, mostly left the Federal Government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and an additional 16 States in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While the protidrogoví agents may not be the monopoly of the door, to capture a small bag with the drug, it is likely that the mine permit State controlled shops with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, said Kevin a. Sabet, a former advisor in the area of drug policy administration of President Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">A few coloradských towns instead of waiting for the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, although it will take about a year before they will be able to any shop to open.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week the city of Montrose to the West of the State proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to find themselves in a situation where someone we license and then we're going to have a big federal business," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We're looking at it, for what the municipality voted, contrary to what the State voted.</seg>
<seg id="47">There's really a lot of questions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to move out of Oxford, because I'm a conservative."</seg>
<seg id="2">Their opinions are not only attacked today's University students.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">I don't remember that I ever dreamed about studying at the University of Oxford.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">And so far I have at the end of the 1980 's. years of the 20th century within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College where I wanted to study history, packed my bags and I poured in the first scandal of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke down and wept.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">Daily Evening Standard claimed that I gave up, because I had objected to the loving students in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">Writer And.  N. Wilson cheerfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from a chipped mugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less comic.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran away because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of their somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was haunted by for one reason and enlightenment in this cradle of the suspected it was how bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a Senior Advisor to Margaret Thatcher and the conservative party, I devotee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You may be asking, why is it up to now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just because recent reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right from the Center suffer from similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the protection of equal rights, as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the Association of the younger vintages (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, argues that because of their political views are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and they made clear that they are not welcome."</seg>
<seg id="19">Called for a position in the University Committee for equal opportunities, which would ensure that their views can freely communicate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation did not help nor recently referred to BBC Two television documentary called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (faery: young, smart and right-wing) about student politics, which conservatives portrayed as Weirdos and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the show, he was introduced to the graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Oxford University conservative Association-OUCA) who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a cane with a silver head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities, students say that a conservative is with them due to the introduction of higher tuition fees are treated as "sacrificial lambs".</seg>
<seg id="23">20 Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Nottingham University conservative Association), told the Sunday newspaper, that "left-wing influence in universities is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="24">People believe that we as a Bullingdon Club, without having us all come together. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Hand-built by a student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "annoying", while devatenáctiletá the President of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in JCR members access to people on the right from the center of a deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">During his first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of one member.</seg>
<seg id="28">I joined in September of 1986, 18 and cripplingly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hatred toward the conservative side was nejhorečnatější.</seg>
<seg id="30">A year earlier the University voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree to the former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">From the atmosphere would be even stalinisté chvěli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">During the first few days in the opening week, when new students come together with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of Wormwood, which was to come.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that not only do the professors in silence by prodding the conservative students, but with flavors and take part in it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">In the wood-panelled classroom was introduced during a mining strike policy, privatization and the Government's resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="35">My first lecture concerned the translation of the French text of the 18th century. century into English and to what followed, I was not prepared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "fold in first paragraph, please."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was pretty tight.</seg>
<seg id="38">Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake batter, was a lot of žlučovitý.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" he asked.</seg>

<seg id="42">"I suggest you read in his spare time took some basic lessons in French, unless you're too busy to social issues," said Professor Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Shattered, I returned to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">During dinner I sat alone at school, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said gently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is so.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspicious of conservatism, is the target.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me, it's bad enough, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the conservative first years, pretending to be are labouristi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later in the local pub I chickened out try and pretend.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I do not agree with everything what Thatcher said.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick has proved unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">First-year Student in philosophy, politics and economics, that (How ironic) attended Eton, he said: "are you the daughter of fascist pig."</seg>
<seg id="55">You're infected.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students with him notovali.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was depraved, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How conservatives love?" asked one.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like they had to feel homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">I could ever lead a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">I would have been forced to meet with like minded people just after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">I'd have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years in front of me had been developed as a purgatory of ignoring and isolating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only openly conservative Professor was Norman Stone, Professor of modern history, that dwelt at my school.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was hated for being conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">Almost there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated this place for its parochialism and pettiness, and for his tendency to Marxist-deterministickému looking at the history.</seg>

<seg id="72">I told the father that the Oxford I hate and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">Could not believe it.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, have been accepted by all political opinions.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it's the best place in the world," he said affably.</seg>
<seg id="76">They wouldn't do that, not in a dreamy mood.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends had a communist always perfect ways.</seg>
<seg id="78">His wet eyes zasmušily.</seg>
<seg id="79">Give it a try yet.</seg>
<seg id="80">I'm sure it's just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart if you left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted from frequent trips to London with my emotional resilience.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a supporter of the conservative party, succumbed to pressure and give up their beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in total seriousness said, that I am "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Even though I was blushing with shame inside, I confessed to my parents "their brains" and called them "old fools".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Relief was only short-term.</seg>
<seg id="87">Nail in the coffin of my career my father boarded up.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time he wrote every week two bars in the Murdochových newspaper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I was huddled up inside and after five minutes of my pursuers give up.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they were gone, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never went back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me usmrkaným scorn.</seg>
<seg id="94">But none of the 18-year-girl or boy should not be at an educational institution subject to such intimidation and virulence.</seg>
<seg id="95">Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only has 14 Conservative Prime Ministers, but also to this day, hiding behind undeserved reputation points with equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="11">This is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in a volcano benefit since the 1960s and have never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemickému industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life, and is used in the manufacture of matches, Fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even in the teeth of the sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Because it is commonly worn by 70 pounds, we earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each journey," explained us Anto, which usually completes three missions a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but can you make 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems like an insignificant amount for such inhuman effort, it's three times what they would have earned on the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for the fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros), "says Porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 eur) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, villages near the volcano, from a serious reason, who is in Indonesia as well as convincing sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, which is a Hindu, and I took it to Java, that converted to Islam."</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">These sentences are part of rapping, which uses local cues such as "put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Ad Agency BBH, which created the video, hoping this commercials they can raise the issue in a light-hearted manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The Agency's Art Director Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to take advantage of the influence of music to ensure that people meet "their civic duty".</seg>

<seg id="10">It's the biggest problem of this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a topic that we need to touch it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the Government attempted to extend a lot of things as perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may be creative, but not fully functional.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why not make the most possible thing, such as the composition of the rap in order to resolve the issue. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The one who does not take too lightly, the Singaporean Government.</seg>
<seg id="17">US $ 1,300 annually to encourage the citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Government's package for marriage and the family provides up to $ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">All these measures had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a wealthy city State with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known konzervatizmem their leaders and strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Birth rate in Singapore with regard to the distribution of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time exceeded the birth rate the value 2, which is considered to be a measure of recovery, in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why do Singapurci have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Mingová, Director of the marriage and the family of the National Agency for the population says that this is due to the "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"People have at their disposal a wider range of options when it comes to the objectives and priorities, it's not only wedding and family," he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and delaying marriage and the procreation of children. The result is a decrease in fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">While in the context of immigration policy, there are efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against a decline in the population, among the locals it caused resentment.</seg>
<seg id="28">On some Singaporean website you can see open xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little desire for integration.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="29">An increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year's ruling Singapore its worst election result since the beginning of independence.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the decline in fertility rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending in health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there are also some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The Government is trying to make nestavělo as many small homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, has begun to affect trade in real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Bureau of urban development began to regulate the number of small dwellings known as "shoebox", that can build in certain urban zones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have an area of 46 square metres, and had great success in sales.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that these flats can support the Bachelor's lifestyle, and deterring developers to build large family houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Managing Director of real estate company EL Developers, claiming that their "shoebox" are selling far more quickly than larger houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"They are more popular, so that they sell for days to weeks faster than homes with larger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new standards lay down clearer rules developers who were previously limited to when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a single project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too stressed out</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although the new rules could be directed towards improving the nation's fertility rates, interview with Singapurci working in the financial district in the Centre of the city indicates that it will not have a big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, that's why a lot of people," says the young clerk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"The others whether they are children.</seg>
<seg id="47">But for me it is important to rely on your own time and money, "says another, about 20 years, young man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Both men and women mentioned career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">The key questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and graduate of the field of Education and teaching, it is considered that to children and adolescents in social networks is correctly oriented, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">States that: "the Internet arose as a means of finding information, but as a social network, has changed the rules of the game."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová noted that academic staff member Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts in order to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We are digital immigrants, who we have to teach, and in doing so yourself just learning, '' he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that it is a complicated subject, "as it is we are asking, as they dropped to what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what not, in an age when it is not yet mature."</seg>
<seg id="46">Also, to be-what concerns around-mentality, at a time when what most want is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the administrator, and is the most efficient way to children and adolescents to show what it's privacy, asking questions that lead them to think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Telling them that doing something is not working," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">In addition, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that you stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: would you like it if someone has posted your picture as you published a friend 's?</seg>
<seg id="51">You know, what about the rest of you be published?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you call the person in the photos of the celebration, you asked them for permission?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more: they need to keep everyone know what are you doing right now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to realize that they must behave in the environment of the Internet, as well as outside of it.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"A man outside the internet be governed by respect, morality and other principles and the same it should be on social networks," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Supervision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a University Professor, a teacher in the first degree and an educational adviser explains that it is necessary to read carefully the parents of children the rules of social networking.</seg>
<seg id="59">"If you understand the intricacies of every single, have a good basis to make with the kids talked about the consequences of opening an account on the Internet may have.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish, '' he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> Guardia is of the opinion that it is essential to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, defended the project of creating the South American citizenship, that Member countries of the Organization of the Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any South American country, which is already occurring among the members of the Andean Community, however, there are still reactionary area, which makes us want to go back to the past," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="7">"Those who are in the lead, never useless, and we do not oblige the South Americans, in turn, all we'll get.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on human rights in Washington is funded by the United States, "he said in allusion to the political asylum granted to Ecuador and the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assangeovi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">President Correa confirmed that this decision has no regrets, because I did not betray their principles, and respecting their "deep democratic values and human rights".</seg>
<seg id="10">Said that at the time "there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, asked him to be on the Swedish territory subjected to interrogation for alleged sexual tort, while "my Swedish legislation allows to carry out the hearing videokonferenčním call, that could take place from the ekvádorského Embassy in London".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk that Assangeho is the deterioration of physical and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken with him since he's on our Embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that my tiny lung problems, but nothing serious," said the head of State of Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"There is, however, that his physical and mental condition deteriorates, because it is locked up in a small space without the ability to exercise in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="15">It would have affected the health of everyone, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">President Correa said that the solution to asylum provided Assangeovi from June at still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of the permit which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the London talks were held to resolve the incarceration of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"We respect human rights nevyjednáváme, such a word in this case, we do not use, but constantly carried out interviews.</seg>
<seg id="18">A solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because the Assangeův Attorney Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European instances, "mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Stated that "If the United Kingdom issue a pass, everything comes to an end tomorrow."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden Mr Assangeho to listen to the still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows without any problem, its legislation and as has already been done in other cases, this issue will be made tomorrow. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took advantage of this situation in order to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and clarified that definitely does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and a lie, which undermine the freedom of expression".</seg>
<seg id="22">The biggest enemies of a free press, we're bad and evil politicians, but bad press in the service of profit, nátlaků and blackmail, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">From this perspective, expressed joy over the fact that even these journalists, "neither bankers nor a hegemonic country nor the bourgeoisie do not speak Ecuador", and point out that, if re-elected, will "continue changes conducted the right way and in the right direction".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">President Correa also backed the decision to continue maintaining the veto expressed regarding EU membership Paraguay Unasur at least until the next election, and argued that the whole "must be firm and netolerovat opportunism and pučismus wrapped in legality", because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In addition, the Ecuadorian President said that it considers "completely appropriate" wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries, now at the time of the judgment of the International Court in the Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Is not currently accepted the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The problem is between the South American and Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is necessary to examine, to have been overcome and the possibility to go forward. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It also expressed the hope in the settlement of the dispute over the maritime border, which resolves to the same Court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the opinion that "it is good to search for Latin America of the international instances, if both countries undertake to accept the verdict, whatever it will be hard".</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">In connection with the possibility to be a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador, to be applied in the order of the third mandate, noted that the perception of this option "with great optimism and joy, even if it's sometimes very hard".</seg>

<seg id="1">AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the result of his test: HIV positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if lightning hit me," she says, when memories of the moment of truth, which the doctor was trying to "moderate", but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy in front of his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his disease alone to shoulder and started to inform about it. And with such a commitment, that it celebrated the 43. birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is without a doubt one of the nejdávnějších patients HIV Unit in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 to 28 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s. years ago, when there was a lot of doubt, a few treatment options and greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, even with the Director of the clinic of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) say goodbye, "because he had a cut".</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time it was synonymous with AIDS have died.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and live fully.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is a lot of people who doesn't know about your illness and come up when a virus caused the destruction of the organism and vysílil immune system, and they are then victims of accidental infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since the AIDS disease appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success that the length of life of the patient, which in due time and in an appropriate manner to begin with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and a specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is not the judgment of death, but that the length of survival and living a full life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients, which is a disease is diagnosed, the better are those who use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years of age and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that the person is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to this knowledge "while adhering to treatment to live without any problems until 75 years", explained in an interview with the doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To emphasize this progress, it is recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the death rate has decreased significantly in recent years and in the case of Mexico dropped the number of people who have died of AIDS, of 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (Yearbook of the UNITED NATIONS joint programme on HIV/AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS were killed according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the State of Jalisco in 2011, died 255 persons and in may so far 187. However, since 2005, is to ensure universal access to antiretrovirotikům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> -Why people continue to die from the disease?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> -"It seems to me that the problem is not how to access treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is what I see, this is how it's going for us at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least for the past 12 years, we have not used stocks of pharmaceuticals. The problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds a compelling figure: "nine out of ten patients comes when it will take effect any associated infection. The only thing you need to do, so we can more affect the overall mortality, the disease is diagnosed early, and therefore it should be on a large scale to offer tests to detect disease, all persons who request them. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal is compliant with specialists and officials from the National Council for the prevention of AIDS in the State of Jalisco as well as directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to do tests to a private laboratory because his friend did it, and despite its low age for him AIDS erupted, and also suffered from Kaposi's Sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and they don't want to know anything else.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I have to die, I'd rather vyřádím three times a week," they say, but it is not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, healthy eating, I practice, I take drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="28">To this day his parents knows only that he suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I'm living a normal life like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">I work, I have a lot of activities, I'm traveling, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I give attention to yourself and to the other person, "lists the Fabrizio, who took on the challenge to share their experiences with the MILENIO JALISCO today within the framework of the world day of AIDS motivated their testimony to those who are afraid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Let them have their tests done. If so, whether he knows as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, it's better. And if you already have been diagnosed, they realize that they can live like anyone else, if they are held accountable. "</seg>

<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Among the programs for health and common citizens is a huge gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds information on HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest gaps are in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places that are dedicated to this task "will actually increase the distribution of condoms, used to give one or two today, give us a hundred packages of condoms, which is very good, but still there are people who do not have access to a condom, '' he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and the assessment of social workers, educational counsellors, employees of pharmacies and medical personnel that teens want to avoid, says the reporter.</seg>
<seg id="39">Designed this ineffective distribution change. Whether condoms are not just for counters, but let the hundred is located in dávkovačích in public men's room, where often young.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It's not promoting promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">And it's not about them "to pay for beer and motel" as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.</seg>
<seg id="42">Takovásexualita is not. It is best to make condoms to those who have sexual life they lead, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judgment of the Court of Appeal approved of the United States, which does not recognize the debt restructuring of the company Grupo Vitro determined bankruptcy in Mexico raises the ominous precedent for any national firm with offices in the neighboring country and the solvency problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It appears, therefore, that the procedures for the restructuring of companies that allow Mexican law, in the country's bars and stars despite international agreements do not apply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Approval of the judgment issued by the 15. in June last year, judge Harlinem Hal at the bankruptcy court for Northern Texas Mexican companies in practice leaves without defence against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.</seg>

<seg id="4">However, the judgment opens the door for the Mexican producers of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing irregularities against the three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">By way of introduction, it should be noted that while a judge in this case contends that the lenders are governed by the insolvency law of the United States Court of Appeals Fifth District based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure sets out the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">First, it was the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have reached about 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This figure does not take account of the Court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another perspective, the Court accused the company Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008-against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, the family firm Of González lodges an appeal for reconsideration right next to the Court of appeal that the assessment was carried out for the full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because originally voted just three.</seg>

<seg id="17">If he fails here, it will require a revision of the appeal process as above, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="18">The case is a serious failing that the court document sent to them by the Mexican Government as a service of the amicus curiae, in which the procedure is described in detail the company's Vitro as part of Bankruptcy Law, in which he points out that the company helped matters by the agreements signed by the two countries, confronted with the law to chapter 15 of the Insolvency Law of the United States.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11">"It was my best years, I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be with a team of los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in eight Championship, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to the Championships-one in 1981, when he made his debut in the BSN Jerome Mincy.</seg>
<seg id="14">If the team has taken over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great leader, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously the head coach at the time, and he taught at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me:" I said, shaking for you 2 m players.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want him? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players ever, Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow me then recommend the quarterback Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I said that if Bayamonu will bring victory in Mincy Championship, then Gauss will contribute to the next. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Championship, when he played for the los Vaqueros team Gauss, enjoyed, but only at a distance, because already in 1988, he was President of the basketball Federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time he wanted to fully concentrate on its features and enjoy the Mincyho location in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"I remember how we beat the United States for the first time in Olympic qualifying game in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up, but we had to have a bronze if the Canadian judge, who let us repeat the final face-off, "Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Is a team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team, that you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, as well as the one that defeated the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the national team in the Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and vypráskali we are a team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one that blew us a bronze at the World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were youths (Javier) "Toñito" Costa and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that might not be the perfect composition, but we managed to win a gold medal and bring great joy, it was the team of Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentina's Neuquénu.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the players on the roster, as they were "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced a player excluded due to a skirmish in Panamerických games in Mar de Plata, we, despite all predictions to win the gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What was the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its number of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one from Puerto Rico to achieve such results at this level as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to mention his involvement in different leagues, where he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best coach for portorickým?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very hard.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good generation belongs to Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From young I like very much the work of Leo Arilla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">His success in the Federation which you consider to be the greatest?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">That I was a part of the era's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s. had the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> You've had the chance to prove it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">They were things that I wanted to introduce, as a division of the youth categories according to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, the guys from Ponce played only in its area and were competing with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Children now travel a lot and play games too, which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">I can also see the benefits of mandatory certification and courses for coaches, umpires and the referee assistants.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's nice to meet you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most listening to music, watching YouTube videos with music from my time, I'm enjoying grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, I'm enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.</seg>
