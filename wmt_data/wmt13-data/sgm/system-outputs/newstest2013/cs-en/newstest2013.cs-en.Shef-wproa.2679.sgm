<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican Party against Obama ’ s re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify its policy of the necessity of the fight against the electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennanovo Centre, such a scam calls for a myth that the electoral fraud in the US is less frequent than the number of people who die following intervention by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, after all, over the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: this new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures partly undermine America ’ s democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada have in the US responsibility for the organisation of the federal election of individual states.</seg>
<seg id="8">And, in this spirit of the majority of the American governments from 2009 enunciates the new laws that make the process of elections, or the minutes in the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has noted the boom after the elections in November 2010, during which more 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only for 2011 submitted 180 proposals law restricting suffrage in 41 States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require that voters tabled identity cards with photographs and proof of the American state of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, zneplatňují the right to be on the list of the voters in the day of the elections and odnímají electoral the right of citizens, with a criminal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006 for the voters did not require the submission of půkazu identity with photographs no US state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first country that this request was introduced, Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">Constitutionality indianského law has confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican authorities spěchaly with the extension of this procedure and to other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years to support the proposals of such laws in 34 States in order to force the voters, to give s identity card with photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, unlike Quebeku do not have the American citizens universal identity cards, such as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, do not own the 11% of US citizens, i.e., 21 million people in the age of allowing us to vote no identification with photographs, issued by the government by their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, there is no such a card identity about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, the purchase of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young, members of minorities, and those with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African-Americans 15% of people with an income below 35 000 dollars; 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters in the age of 18 to 29 years therefore does not have the desired identity cards with photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And this is not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students who are as voters known for their by shifting to democratic candidates are not in several States entitled to use their identity cards with photographs on display their school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same States allow the Members of the hunting or fishing clubs, who elect rather Republican candidates card exposed to these clubs in the elections to use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, no state at the elections did not require proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such a requirement to introduce Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since the year 2011 adopted around 12 States laws, which sets out the obligations of the electorate demonstrate that they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are obviously to reduce the number of votes from hispánské minorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">In fact, be noted that two of the three Hispanic prefer a democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators in 2011 support in the eight States laws that abolishing the Minutes of the voters in the day of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, limit the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to the voters who want to go.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have their consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the general election in 2004, have helped the campaign for the Minutes of the electorate to zaregistrování around 10 million people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures adopted after 2009 but has caused the decline in adding new voters in 2010 to 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican legislators, in the other five States adopt laws aimed at reducing the period for the elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were poor African-Americans 33% of voters who elected in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among Hispanic was the case as well.</seg>
<seg id="40">Were only 11% of all of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens of the voters in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, whites, who were 76% of all of the voters were only 46% of voters who elected in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Against the approval of the laws, which restrict the registration of the electorate, of course, very strongly supported democratic legislators and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors blocked its veto of a few of the proposals of the laws.</seg>
<seg id="44">In order to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">Damage is partly managed to reduce them.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, the laws requiring the submission of the identity card with photographs taken only 16 of the 34 States.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly established rules, however, entirely undeniably will make it more difficult in 2012, the performance of the voting rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics are talking, above all, about bias of the laws and they are seen as an obvious attempt to influence the election results in 2012 in key States.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report Brennanova centre of the year 2011 shows that States, where these laws have been approved, represent 171 of 270 votes in the College necessary for victory in the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain already today: the new provisions will have an adverse impact on the voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures partly undermine America ’ s democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">The detection prostate cancer: to go through the investigation or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The test PSA can sometimes wrong results that have been negative or even incorrectly positive, which has led to unnecessary medical zákrokům.</seg>
<seg id="3">All this has increased the hesitancy of men, who are already so reluctant to the investigation of all to go.</seg>
<seg id="4">To be investigated or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked for the opinion of the two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies carried out in the US has shown a high level of contamination between testovanými groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other studies, this time the European considered different mortality between patients who are running the investigation, and those who did not go to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also proved after 12letém distance that those who do not go on the investigation, have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastáz.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore commend investigation from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your relatives had a direct prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">More men are also the Afro-American of origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision, as soon as cancer is disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are neutral.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to explain to the patient rightly peace the dangers of its kind of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which has in the long term, the impact on the life, and to focus in these cases rather on the active supervision of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, a number of men, which has been diagnosed with cancer, cure, as their kind of cancer is not an aggressive and does not compromise is to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will propose them rather the implementation of the active oversight and in the case of taxes disease offering the treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly, and with greater precision we lay down criteria, which help in the decision-making process that kind of cure and which do not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet I therefore recommend investigation to go through.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is important but to go through the interview with a doctor and to establish whether it is appropriate to undergo an investigation or not.</seg>

<seg id="21">The prevention of disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In spite of the progress in research seems to be the best way to reduce the risks of diseases the adoption of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that, if all of a healthy eating and not enough hýbali, one could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="25">'If all stop smoking, this figure would have risen by at least 50%,' underlines the André Beaulieu, the spokesman for the Canadian companies for cancer research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that around 10% of cancer is causing the inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">A percentage of also remains completely unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian society for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, although the number of smokers is falling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes it is worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also risk factor for several other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is now in the 'Once Quebeku 1.5 million smokers,' is dismissive spokesperson André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging figure: 10 years after the smoker to stop smoking is declining, the risk of cancer deaths by half.</seg>

<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These organisations also recommends to reduce the red meat consumption.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too high consumption can lead to increased risk of kolorektální of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is appropriate to avoid and for sausages, for which the same is true.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat uzením, sušením or solením can lead to the creation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>

<seg id="47">A study to vitamín E are under the SCC over and contradictory.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgsův boson examined</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The communication on the likely discovery Higgsova bosonu caused last summer justified a stir.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is the view that this boson participate in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the matter in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And it is the last particle, whose existence is the standard model - the best of our or 'least bad' explanations of nature and the behaviour of the matter - but which has not empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Between the physics, however, there is still 100% certainty that it is about Higgsův boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">In any doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to Higgsovu bosonu, as are prefigured the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">The new data published this week during the great physical Congress in Kyoto, but rather the absence of even all the data in order to have an absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, suppose that it is about Higgsův boson, because the risks of error seems to be a small, and let us look at what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world is quite obvious law, according to which the two things cannot occur in the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard on this, otherwise, ublížíte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although it is very strange world částicová physics, it also shows that it is a similar law: Pauliho exclusion the principle according to which they cannot two particles take the same room in the same time, if they are in the same 'kvantovém the state of the' - this' state 'roughly speaking creates some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Further fyzikové particles are divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, we will find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently respect Pauli principles.</seg>
<seg id="14">And, at the other, the move bosony, podlí anarchists, who are contemptuous nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can easily be at the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony also divided into two groups in the equipment (incidentally, which is absolutely wonderful) The Particle Adventure, in laboratories Berkeley: mesony that we leave unheeded, and 'the particles', which is spreading the major natural forces and with which it is probably Higgsův boson somehow spřízněn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, it should be to say that these bosony are not as exotic that, as it would be possible to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you read the article, it is thanks to the bosonu with an unusual banalitou: the photon, or 'particle light', which is' a vector of 'electromagnetic forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the particles with electric nábojem accelerate or to change its direction, 'to frustrate the' the electromagnetic fields in this particular point, just as oblázek hozený in the pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this' inconvenience 'a electromagnetic wave of (light, infračervené or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave of is nothing other than fotonem - and therefore one of the bosonů,' of the forces'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable fields</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is also with Higgsovým bosonem, only that, 'disturb' is to be other fields, Higgsovo fields that this boson appeared.</seg>
<seg id="22">This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; to his excitaci it is necessary to achieve a very high energy values, as with the frozen levels pond, already zčeří only a lot of great balvan.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is to be used as a huge urychlovač part as urychlovač in a laboratory CERN - great hadronový urychlovač the friendly ties is circle with constituency 27 km! - in order to develop a energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with electromagnetic field, we again suited to clarify the relationship between Higgsem and the matter.</seg>
<seg id="25">With electromagnetic field are not responding, all of particles even all materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, doing so, but not other - a piece of paper, for example, will never be itself to keep on ledničce.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the same is true that, with all the particles are not responding Higgsovým field: those that do so, are a matter, while others (such as foton, let us look at it) do not have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Mrs Nováková asks what all of these studies are what 'will provide'?</seg>
<seg id="29">In terms of science is a confirmation of the standard model (SM), which allows fyzikům to examining any inconsistency between overhead and forecasts SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">Moreover, many physicists literally wishes to have managed to find them, because any difference could open the area of 'new physics' and to close some of the loopholes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to state that the model is still huge shortcomings there is no clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which account for around 80% of the space of matter (in turn ouha!).</seg>
<seg id="32">Facilities CERN, however, until now, there is such contradictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Responses</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Response of these research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs Novákových very hard to predict, however, it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hleďte: at the beginning of the 1960 ’ s not as pioneers Bellových laboratories and the notion of the revolution, for their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Assuming the scientific use, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">The physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in Bell Labs, where a laser in 1960, invented on, and which formed the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulzní) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially regarded as a 'toy to laborky'.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, the application of the result of all the instruments that surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle created a little light snímač in 1969, during its work aimed at optiku.</seg>
<seg id="41">This snímač, although Boyle initially not the case at all neplánoval, now serve as' an eye 'all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Peace Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities of around LHC we urgently need to change the life, however, this means that one really knows...</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with the approach to the palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to a palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to mitigate the suffering, when ill will come into the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or a care home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organisations, for example, the home Victor-Gadbois and Society of domestic palliative treatments the Grand Montréal, specialised more or less exclusively on care by onkologickým patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And it is precisely this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebeku leads to many doctors specialising in palliative care worried about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed by the leaders in the area of palliative treatments, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which show its opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to doktorky Christiane Martelové quebecký the health system is not sufficiently efficient, to ensure access for all people for the quality of the palliative care, before we can agree with the implementation of euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As the saying, has recently experienced pacientku, which spent 14 days in the throes of the huge without anyone has made the necessary steps to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="52">Fears that patients do not ask for the killing of this reason that they do not receive appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">The same time, and that many onkologů takes care of their patients until the last moments without regard to the unfavourable prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové have already been completely abandoned the minimum, when the hard chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I say that their onkoložce with treatment, I replied that regrets the fact that I cease to fight, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">While I said, that it is the end of the!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is not omnipotent care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr Martelová is estimated that 90% of people who wish to die, thanks to its ošetřujícím doctors for the fact that their wishes nevyplnili if their team palliative píče alleviate the pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season PSG you with an entirely new momentum.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this development?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be explained by the fact that all individuals go to itself, or completely new dimension PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">The big players came to us.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Therefore, you are using the competitive environment, which has introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">The additional this summer are accustomed to play games on the very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it follows that player as I have then more taste in the match, and wants to give the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">And, moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a great deal in connection with my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">To hand is of the assistants, such as Claude Makelele basketball, which at the same position as I do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And has Ancelotti decisive the floor in the right moment?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti is the respect of all the technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in 1 League itself does not have equal and are among the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has enormous experience and sophisticated teams plenty of degrees.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also worked with excellent players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he wins in Paris other titles.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had a number of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust which gives me, is another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As you are looking to the first part of the season PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the league of 1, took us Lyon leading position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the League of masters: very easily we have come into osmifinále.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is your club in this competition goal?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far away as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now can become anything.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be for the quality of the European teams of a rival.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want to win its first qualification Group before Portem, so that we can play in retaliation osmifinále at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the PSG state in the short term, a great European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">This budget is...</seg>
<seg id="40">To Paris has become a great European club, must win the titles and be listed in history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today this is not yet.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the financial side has PSG means to this intention has managed to take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a failure nezvítězit in 1 League as in the last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">A lot of this year we want to win ligový title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we have enough has been lacking.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed, because we have had to win.</seg>
<seg id="48">We should have an excellent season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We therefore accumulated 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Usually, with 79 of the points you have a clear master...</seg>
<seg id="51">But a different club, Montpellier, should season even more wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think that this year it will lead.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the title have large teams, as is the Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think that we have available weapons to be defeated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual expect from us a lot of given what we have invested and what we have a player.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are adopting this completely.</seg>
<seg id="57">Is that, when at home emerge victorious Troyes 4: 0 and still to find something we in the newspapers vyčítají, so this is not pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what people want from you can even more.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is not, of course, to win 4: 0 on every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to set the game style.</seg>
<seg id="62">You need to build a team of time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the championship, we have shown that we can play.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, which is already the second season qualified for the osmifinále, while also invested huge sums!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the investovaným sums, we might expect that you will have the other 15 points ahead!</seg>
<seg id="66">The urážíte other clubs and the French League.</seg>
<seg id="67">Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in the last season too failed, with new PSG moved to the next stage.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how it is 1 League wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we can smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as if the PSG in all relied on performance Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that says that there is a 'dependence on Zlatanovi'.</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovič it is very efficient and that gives a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Due to come here and shows that it is a star 1 League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where, has shown that it is a big player, the world a star.</seg>
<seg id="75">We respect the person, and also in our team player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people around them.</seg>
<seg id="77">What has been achieved, it is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This led and others to increase their own level of the game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, which belongs to the best defenders in the world, also allows the other side by side growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you feeling Euro 2012, with the French representatives?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I wanted to this tournament ’ s power play.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, due to injury, I was not able to play, as I would imagine.</seg>

<seg id="85">Today I have also succeeded in representation play a good struggles.</seg>
<seg id="86">In this and I had hoped from its boarding representation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">President Mohammad Mursí laid into another poker game.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided because of the declaration of the Constitution, which he temporarily grants unrestricted powers, he decided to play a vabank.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the centre of the announced irrespective of the opinion that all the other, the constituent assembly tomorrow approve the final text.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago, the head of state this Assembly of the other two months to complete the necessary work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For almost two years is using Egypt provisional the text, which was very much supplemented, which undermines the constitutional the stability of the country and leads to the legal rumours.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the point of view of the opposition President, in its' autocratic deliriu ', continue to' violates its word 'and' tramples on the right '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His supporters, but that it is a means to crack down on as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transitional process.</seg>
<seg id="10">In two weeks ago, it should be a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short time slot, which will compel the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article by article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For President, it is also about the way to achieve the national and the democratic legitimacy, while the whole country being rocked by the protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly newspaper Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.</seg>
<seg id="14">In particular, therefore, that this hastily organised the vote is the people of Egypt before the ultimatum: 'It approve my text, or leave unlimited powers', which otherwise would have for the adoption of a new constitution end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And, in this specific air yesterday 85 of the Members of this constitutional assembly with a large majority of the Islamists text approved.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the Liberals have been lacking in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, not long before the announcement of the Constitution, bouchli doors with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Defenders of human rights, civil society or religious minorities their step napodobili.</seg>

<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution have often been voted through unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators further suspended at the fact that one of the few disputes with the day točil around... hours for the prayer, when some Members of the committee held the view that an hour in this Chamber are rightly seřízeny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, is composed of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains the same with the end of the version of the 1971 constitution and states that 'the principle of Sharia law are the main source of law'.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for which is the introduction of Islamic law one of the fundamental requirements, hoped, that will replace the term 'principle of' with 'rules', which would allow more stringent implementation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, in turn, the fact that this article has not been corrected, is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other component parts of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">'the hypocrisy of the', argue the Liberals, who see in this just a rhetorical problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamification of the constitution is taking place through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Focus particularly on Article 220, which confers on university al-Azhar advisory role, especially for the issue of control of the laws of the agreement with Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the professionals to Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is worrying, because 'people drafted in to the expression of are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">We can see this as beginnings of theocracy '.</seg>
<seg id="32">The concerns of Liberals even more fuels the fact that the next President, universities should be less moderate than the existing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Meanwhile, the 'displayed no specific religious result.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution remains Egypt aware of the framework of the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who worked on this text, are not ulamové, but the University, many of them vystudovala in the French schools, 'life-threatening concerns Alexis Blouet, which is preparing to work on constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, agree with the fact that 'there can be controversy over the interpretation of Article 220, because it used the deadlines are in the religious terminology.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is, in particular, the reference to 'fiqh' [Islamic rule of science, which red.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And, in future, it may be a question, to what extent are the civilian judges competent to be able to express'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday the agreed text is in addition to the religious sites very criticised because of the enhanced powers, which grants the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that have been significant restrictions on the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another issue: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army will not be the verification of the budget for the defence of the implementation of Parliament, but the National Council of defence.</seg>
<seg id="43">Furthermore, will not be in the military courts banned management with civilians, requested by associations for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These associations, speaks in connection with the text that they think it is directed against freedom, their doubts.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and an insult to continue to be banned, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, particularly for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">No article, moreover, does not deal with the protection of women, emphasises Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to it is the only positive point to ban torture stated in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.</seg>

<seg id="7">Yet this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, residential and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, FMS promises that time will be the appropriate tests mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the tests will be composed not only of Language Competence, but also from the Russian history and of the foundations of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will also be to affirm to gain and the extension of a work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where it is ruština official language.</seg>

<seg id="15">Migrants can to pass exams in all cities; already today in Russia is open to the more than 160 such centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to support the introduction of the testing of support and Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal migration services).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law entered into force, the defenders of human rights very much to ask the question: in the press and what it actually bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the sake of visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all - are the responsibility of the representatives of the migration services - to enable it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of 'slave labour'.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people now talks about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the President of the boards of directors FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be launched before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only the system will enable the organised the recruitment of 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise in emigrants without the occupation, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical check-up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the knowledge of the language - says with conviction Sebelev - is the future can be sentenced to conflicts with dishonest people who help him under the pretext of 'ensure' reference to the terrible, small kind, in which he and dozens of others, such as he himself, suffer months without food and documents and fingers for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">'In their own country they promise one, but it is, after arrival podvedou zabaví them passports, not paid the promised wages, the Tajik governance' confirms the migration of labour MS Tolib Šaripov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Nenadávejte!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia, recognise that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to go, but they have no experience even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not their fault, as the disaster: very little Turkmen, Uzbeks Tajiks can afford to regain at least a reasonable basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families need something also feed children, not to mention the fact that we need is decently obléci, road and equip to school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children mature in the working age, they must go there in the first opportunity for work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without the knowledge of the language that is difficult - to admit it.</seg>
<seg id="33">'you feel the humiliation and less worthy'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that, with regard to the law on the language tests point human rights defenders in one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be implemented only for those migrants who have the legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If it will not have, so will not have to pass exams or will not get any additional official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, there are the majority of migrant workers, as well as ever in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">'Welcome to, or Nepovolaným'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the coming of workers argue that to get the official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all those of the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Legalising in addition, the costs money: from 12 to 16 000 rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the false registration can be obtained rapidly and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that we have essentially false documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">'require a, two on cigarettes, tea,' - share with journalists on their experience citizen Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="45">'Well, Don ’ t be stingy, kup the malbu'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of the force of the law on the language of the false papers are not only on the registration of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="47">Employees FMS has already been seized a number of false certificates confirming completion of the language tests.</seg>
<seg id="48">Falsified documents are printed on ordinary color tiskárně.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, to new owners were free of charge: each of the migrants in the hope that this will facilitate the problem with absolvováním tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is two and half times higher than carry out an official test: it will become a migrant workers three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task of the near future so is to ensure the system from corruption, so that workers could not simply buy documents, in that coincide with government officials and defenders of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="52">The government authorities have not yet can promise to foreign workers, who failed tests first time, the time required to have completed a rate of the foundations of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the visitors, who cannot Russian-speaking, it is supposed to work in the areas in which does not require active negotiations with the people.</seg>

<seg id="4">This is the response of government institutions on the recent events: the incentive cases were shootings at svatbách that bypass without of the victims, and the massacre prepared Moscow advocate Dimitrij Vinogradovem, as a result of which seven people died.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The police wants to ban the wearing of the dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age, which can be to obtain a licence to the wearing of weapons - from 18 to 21 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">This support the idea of a committee of the Duma for security and the fight against corruption Irina Jarovaja, which has promised to amend the law on weapons will be presented to the State Duma in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior was for six months of the year 2012 committed 142 crimes of the use of firearms registered authorities in the Ministry of Interior, while for the same period was committed quite 1168 of thousands of criminal offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of an open letter believe tighten up legislation in the area of civilian weapons fail to get the perpetrators to come to the 'black' market.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to their words can be at the moment to find in Moscow any weapon at low cost.</seg>

<seg id="18">The first of them - 'the army or military way', this means a weapon, which was odcizena during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Weapons stole and Russian officers and the kavkazané,' says Baraněc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another type of 'black arms' weapons are stolen criminals with the representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that this includes the theft of the police and weapons inventories stolen directly from the staff of the authorities in criminal proceedings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal 'mainly' in the sale of the military inventories.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military warehouses there is often a professor.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="26">'At present there are private firearms enterprises, which are not competitive on the international market, and they decommission weapons, which are on the black market, including the Moscow,' says the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of the 'black' of the market is smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Particularly large number of a gun, and machines from poor countries, such as, for example, Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">'Wherever men and women is their production, sometimes weapons produced in malovýrobě, and the mafia, which was organised their steady production,' explains the former soldier.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists examine reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Russia ’ s statistical office, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals aimed at the theme of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers, comes from the military and the executive.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons is on the black market 'fault of the officials, whose work is associated with weapons,' says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to data, which have researchers available, comes from 17% of arms from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases to the theft of weapons in their production, 5% is' black archaeology '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Prodavač-konzultant one of the trade in arms, who asked to confuse his name is convinced that weapons found in vykopávkách black 'archeology' no one is a long time ago - are simply too old.</seg>

<seg id="3">In recent days in America has a wave of protests against low wages in hypermarketech society and Walmart in restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as' McDonald ',' Burger King ',' Taco Bell ',' Wendy 'with' and 'Kentucky Fried Chicken'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Yet no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of the ninth, or whether it is doomed soon cease to exist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This whole share for the support of the trade unions and the many left-wing social organisations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to increasing the modest as salaries, which are ordinary workers in Walmartu and in the systems of fast food, is the aim of the protests to achieve in the creation of them in their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently it is this economic sector virtually intact odborářským movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called 'black Friday', when America has hit orgy of cheap fire sales, by the millions of people and in some cases has been accompanied by a rvačkami.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In this day some workers society Walmart, in which around the world is working to 2.2 million people have left their workplace and demonstrated together with the trade unions and the left-wing activists multinationals chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sold throughout the world, despite everything, from plenek hunting guns and car batteries after vysavače, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores are in the average of about 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, many employees with low wages in stores Walmart buys only for themselves in work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and the range of goods made from the chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of the critics Walmart can afford to sell goods as cheaply partly because few pay their employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic wheelchairs or small scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators' black Friday 'called for an increase in salaries and they complained about this, provided that the costs of health insurance companies have risen sharply from 30 billion to $100 per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical worker Walmart receives 9.5 of dollars per hour, however, this does not correspond to the level of expenditure, they say employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley shows that, if Walmart increase the average wage of at $12 for an hour, it will be a society state 3.2 billion dollars per year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is in an average of 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If a company Walmart will increase in wages fully on the shoulders of the consumers, each state visit in store only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year so that consumers will spend around $12,39 more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Defenders of society Walmart point out that protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause practically no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">'black Friday' in the shops society has lasted from 8 p.m. this evening on Thursday, until midnight the next day, and during this period, the company sold Walmart some 5,000 items of goods for the second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, its coffers have made in 'black Friday' almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Representatives of society Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of 'less than five' staff Walmartu, and that protest was full of 'all other media sensation', which organised the trade unions.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continue this week in New York, where their aim was not the trading houses Walmart (those pokrokovém in the city are not too much in favour of, and there is therefore hardly), but 'McDonald' and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says that sells billion portions, and then you nor does not properly with sick and you for your serious work!</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">Currently make the minimum wage for the work in line with federal laws and with the rules of the State of New York 7,25 of dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fastfoodové restaurants this wage gradually increasing, but only slightly, and on average, their ordinary workers in New York 8,90 of dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this drahém city no one has a lower wage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well, I cannot understand how can you in New York exist for this money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employment in the 'McDonald' it is almost a quarter of US teenagers who work for the end of the school part-time work and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or intends to remain there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">At present is constantly meet in an interview with the workers' McDonald 'who complain that must live from this money and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in the forum of the Wall Street Journal a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how it is you feed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The protesters, which began in the morning on Thursday 6: 30 on the 'McDonalda' on the 40th Street and on America Avenue, demand that the bank clerks and kuchaři in business dinners started to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than double their current minimum wages.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also called for in the sphere of fast food trade union organisations were founded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American laws forbid governance to defend the establishment of a trade union activists and to punish the trade union movement bullying and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">From the other side of the governance of the only rarely makes life easier for them.</seg>
<seg id="43">To introduce in business dinners trade unions, however, it is difficult even for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is extremely high staff turnover.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="45">Disagreement</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In this day were held loud protests in many other cheap restaurants Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of this action was at midday Assembly in the 'McDonalda' near the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, especially Member of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald' says that sells billion portions, and then you nor does not properly with sick and you for your serious work! '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators have a support also other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the candidate for the mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that 'we need to act together to support workers fastfoodů to achieve fair pay for their work and economic prosperity, deserves every a New Yorker!'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of America ’ s sphere of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended by just a few hundred people, even if not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>

<seg id="1">'We are the brain to deceive, on average,'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Between the supporters of modern technologies, the virtual reality is popular the subject of the enlarged reality; in the last time, this means regarding the world in particular through hranol special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the early years of its annual conference has Google working model of this new, and in November, it was announced that the request for the patent has also submitted a Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">From an interview with the head of the interactive 3D technologies in Cambridge laboratory society Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that this company to the scientists are glasses already past.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is it is the perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air empty-handed, the creation of a virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Tell us please, aware of the framework of the deals with your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with a person's interactions with machines, but at the same time, we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Humanity has locked in the stage of work with pixely ploché on the screen, the most, sometimes touches on the screens the finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want vyhlížet in 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, konzola Xbox and sensors Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without sensors Kinect, because for all is very interesting the possibility of management by gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What is still ahead of us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Notwithstanding the fact that the system Kinect relocate interaction on physical level, very many interactions is still ongoing on ploché the screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">Entry to improve the flow of information (system takes on a greater amount of data), but so far, the exit the flow of not particularly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, we are working on the really trojrozměrných display systems based on the various technologies, including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to allow computer the world into our physical world, to do it more real.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose, however, it is necessary to get to know not only users, but also the room around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">We will then be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much more appropriate form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first and foremost - to hell with those brainless helmami virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about hlasovém control?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is a popular thing, but the nepřeceňuje?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Certainly it cannot be regarded as a panacea - the question arises as to privacy, because not always want to inform the rest in our neighbourhood on their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all the types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for the control of the equipment in public places, we had the project in which we think about the gestures, but not on rozmáchlých, only about such skoupých, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gestures are doing nesnímala kamerou equipment, but náramkem, which would monitor movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meanwhile, it is great, but, in theory, it can be narrowed on the size of the náramkových watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, that the future is a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- A both?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For example - As you ask me give you this can limonády?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say it and, at the same time, get.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually simply I am speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that will be very difficult to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So, you want to make users to adapt to what at the moment can or cannot machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- That is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we will have to work, above all, on the development of new types of sensors that can find out more precisely the response of the person.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laserové sensors, which provide a relatively good an in-depth distinction, this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- if you have to talk about their work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requests for modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Today, the depth of the distinction is not sufficient or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In essence the current generation - that this is, from what we can be reflected in our work on a three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, that it would be good to obtain 8 megapixelů the rate of 1 000 F / P.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not only megapixely itself, but as matrices and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">While looking at issue are all the current technology for the lack of us - this přidělává work designérům algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we must bear in mind not only the distinction in axes X and Y, but also.</seg>
<seg id="43">So very important it is also the speed, the number of images for the second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows 30 images for the second, frankly, are a little, especially for the gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our laboratories in Redmondu did dotykový snímač with nastavitelným delay the processing of 1 100 MS, with the current, sériově produced sensors that are closer to the second value (60-100 MS).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of a man with a machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, in the work was very useful the equivalent of such equipment, only I do not need so much dotyků, but I need some images per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In a system of Kinect are now used the three 'cameras', one of which is actually infračerveným vysílačem and the other - přijímačem odraženého signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">Already the third and camera - in fact, this is the normal snímač visible the Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not apply to the setting of the depth of objects.</seg>
<seg id="52">Greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem of...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse, because it would be required to increase the volume of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible system, analogový Kinect pohrát have to be concerned about the curvature of the location of the cameras and look at how this will help in determining a three-dimensional location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) has not presented publicly my glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that when it comes to the day-to-day reality of the widespread use of technologies with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, go and constantly keep smatphone in zdvižených the hands of is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be 'transferable' form of the enlargement of the reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the platform clouds přepínat ever from the blinkers on phones, projekční displej and further round in circles.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses - this is a very personal equipment, that is their power (private things you can see only you), and, at the same time, the weakness - widespread the reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work on the same time, the virtual objektech with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holografickými injuries in the air is available not only Tony Starkovi in the 'Iron Isle of Man', but also the normal smrtelníkovi.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one of the problem to which the critics often point: there is no dotyková response!</seg>
<seg id="61">Do not feel hand nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, a baby also needs an artificial gravity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of NKÚ: control švarcsystému failed due to the politicians</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has in relation to public procurement good supervisors and high quality legislation is lagging behind, but in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview Aktuálně.cz that is what the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">'The will never be perfect, but must be correct its applications - that is what we believe is missing,' comments on the current situation Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar conclusions also indicates the joint control of the Czech and German supervisors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the practice of States, the wrong approach, Mr Peter Nečase to the so-called 'švarcsystému'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, Mr Prime Minister has said that the ODS not entrepreneurs bother its checks - it is therefore prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">'The must be arranged, after all, somehow, and if something ban, so, after all, neither Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to go to control and enforcement obligations,' notes Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and the German side, in which was to the legislation on public procurement in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was specifically?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control, which we launched the about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply, it is that the European legislation regulates how to address, followed by the public procurement is the individual national legislation, and then also the practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We are all this put together, and although control is not yet closed, have shown us be very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps even 'more stringent and better', however, the practice is in some of the parameters of the better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Therefore, confirms that it is not enough to create still further and further more precise rules, but it is a need to devote itself the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What you actually this project can help, as it is for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That is the joint control could contribute to stop make an effort to specifying the laws, reducing and improvement of limits, if not so positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Efficiency means to obtain adequate thing for a sensible (but that does not always mean the lowest) price, to avoid enrichment and or criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, by reducing the limit of procurement, that we should not necessarily to achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps that the system overwhelm such a number of 'paper', that those who want to look for the holes in this system, so those of this will be able to a much easier than limit remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the domestic problems with the communitarisation of legislation concerning public procurement into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system of control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is the office of a similar our NKÚ, or is it set otherwise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities concerned, as there is NKÚ Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised, as we also has the College, only to form a little different way, but in principle, both the authorities are similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the auditors and at the level of federal countries - the system from our a little different.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can control only the Federal money for us, represented by the state funding.</seg>
<seg id="26">Means of public, which are managed in the region and the municipalities, the control of the level of federal courts of auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As the legislation, so it is easier than our?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general should like this without specific data when not, however, in some respects, Germany is often described as a model, but it is certainly to say that it is in all the better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is necessary, therefore, that are better supervisors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This certainly not, but once again, I do not have such a comparison I.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to say that even countries that we consider it a model, are faced with a series of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise it would not be a beneficial for them to cooperate with our office, not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With regard to domestic legislation, as for your office mean the amendment to the law on public procurement, are already somehow its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the period of validity of this amendment is a relatively short, so we have not yet in the control actions does not show.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we are ex post controls, it is necessary to reckon with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We are seeing this not only in the process of preparing the future of checks - nastartovali we have our new instrument 'risk detection inefficiencies', through which we prohnali almost 14 of thousands of public procurement, and we have analysed is - there are those changes, of course, will show, because it will change the limits, the conditions of certain types of the selection procedure to govern and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Approval of this law therefore consider rather for the benefit, or additional burden of red tape?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it is the case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that can arise that the rules' tighten 'and it will not be possible to honour them.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the functioning of the previous rules are controlled donor (such as those committed in the case of the regional operational programmes of the Regional Council) of the fact that every failing to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">So, is the price of law in this way, become stricter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think that, not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want it to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal errors, which has no impact on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will be to create a more pressure on the red tape.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how this is therefore out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us show the way the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, Mr Prime Minister has said that the ODS not entrepreneurs bother controls on the so-called 'švarcsystému' - and what does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be arranged, after all, somehow, and if something ban, so, after all, neither Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to go to control and enforcement obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Can say: 'we change the law and permit', but it cannot say that we will do, as that nothing.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="51">In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented - which is rightly, both to protect public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic when bidders with the best offer is excluded just for the formal shortcomings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but must be correct its applications - that is what we believe is missing.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Moreover, in December will hold a completely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">It can be the readers closer to imagine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a national benefiční action, which we are planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have chosen to use the potential of the end of a marketing mayského calendar of the announced on 21 December at 11: 10 of the morning.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It was about my idea, we then everything devising, together with our výtvarníkem Honzou Augustou.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want, together with the public to think about the state of the world will be passed on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the mayského calendar we have also created the unique kolekci objects shoes, T-shirt, bags or original sprouts against the end of the world whose zakoupením on www.e-tap.cz us people can also support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Group of the The TAP TAP, together with other the singers also nazpívala the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called 'The End of the world abolished'.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today is already very popular on YouTube, will also on these benefičních concerts?</seg>

<seg id="21">As you have got to cooperation with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are also working with others, the Czech cultural stage, given that we are organising a lot of benefičních actions and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying to is heavily involved in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that the majority of them are interested in cooperation with us and entertaining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the equipment bezbariérového education centres Studeo sixth year, which we conduct with TAP in civic associations Jedličkově constitution.</seg>
<seg id="27">For students are regularly attend school Jedličkova the constitution and address them in the activities, which is celebrating and interest.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the means to be issued for lektory ourselves, we are thus to enable it to them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of such Jedličkova constitution in the future there will be a separate building, in which we will transfer with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Any the concert to address a few musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what you have is singling out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to draw up a programme which will address all the generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague, I will speak Chinaski Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bártou, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří dry.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details you learn to www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">You are planning any similar 'bombastické action' and in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we will be the first time to act on the Prague Spring, so here we are certainly an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year we would also like to zahráli in the Czech national home in New York, and I personally, while in the US, I would like to link and with the speech made in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are not a minimalist, yet you have already spoken out for example, in Madrid, London, Brussels or in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The TAP TAP however, it is a group, which is the disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">As these routes zvládáte logistically and organisationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This is not so dreadful, as it appears.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members of the electrical wheelchair, its carts must travel in zavazadlovém area, then, of course, vláčíme a large number of cargo and beden with the tools...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, has always performed without problems, and the British Airways ČSA on us have been an excellently prepared, that I have wondered how many times when.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we have returned recently, this was without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the výjezdům abroad can you compare how individual different in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have not yet met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After the Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we have just in Russia have seen that in the East is still in full the start.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague is Moscow very bariérová, there is still an unusual to one of the electrical wheelchair himself in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">Nor is there such commonplaces, as do you prefer wheelchair users should that be in the lift.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are also citizens' associations, which seeks to the problems of people with disabilities to draw your attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And what on the contrary, we still need to catch up with more advanced developing countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is a lot of things, in which we are still behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the order of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is perfectly normal that people with a heavy achievement of moving to the public can go for no to museums, everywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not the power of the usual, that a large number of people with disabilities more active part in social life, in that we are on the contrary, with The TAP TAP a bit ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when the moment of us will be the major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things will start to change really.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Had The TAP TAP is currently very popular, but a few years back what you in 1998 compelled to establish it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I came as vychovatel into Jedličkova Constitution, where I was around many young people who were interested something to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I myself muzikant hraji, among other things, on saxofon, so I, together with my colleague has zájmový music circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and over time, we, as our host at Láďa Angelovič, a little bit out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity but come in recent years, or wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that help us when we started to connect to the famous singers and also actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">There has been us that the work that is not to see, in fact, as would not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, moreover, we can afford quality lektory, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was your order to follow it through with The TAP TAP this high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Since the beginning, I felt the potential of the fact that it can do something else.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness is overwhelmed things, where one have imitations of the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is a logical, all new is accepted carefully and it takes time.</seg>
<seg id="70">The things that are rare, it is very little, but I think I dare say that the TAP TAP are one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression in a man who us see the first time, it is, of course, one regret, this is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with no achievement are suffering from all the abandoned beings, which we must regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that the fact that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that, when something right people with achievement, so this is not the only for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Help this success also that you have a strict the head of the many people, as you said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do good work, we need to be in many matters uncompromising and demand budgetary discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it is perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic vision and with the head in the skies at, and when they discover that must twice week to go to the test, be at the product and spend a lot of time on the roads at concerts, so it is the enthusiasm quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">That cannot but is everywhere, in every group that wants to work, and which wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the moment has had The TAP TAP 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them was in its beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are open to the group, people are leaving and come, this cannot be prevented.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency adopted Poland for the twentieth a Member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which is a full member of the ESA has happened on 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the next few years contributed to a number of projects agencies.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the path of Poland into outer space has already begun much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Years in the space to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I will mention, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw astronomical Observatory that on 6 December 1933 was the idea of its pioneering work The entry into force in the aerospace sector.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (NAR. 1905) to audience unmoved and, after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr John Gadomski interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld in 1934 got for entry in the aerospace sector in France and the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho André Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Vzpomenutý doctor John Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major force behind the commemoration and aerospace sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the Polish journals published by the hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on these vědním disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski has become the world ’ s known force behind the aerospace sector and its contribution has been acknowledged by the fact that one of the kráterů in the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 was built railway drezína in Poland, which should be endowed with rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and are not known or the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for start-up far or to its curbing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information on this drezíně are known only from dobového of the press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933 the rocket missiles began with the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research to ensure the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with, Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and, Professor Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From dochovaných materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of the German troops was interrupted research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, in the specialist of the press a proposal by fotoelektrické stíhací missiles, which proposed engineer Rohoziński and in the coming year to work - torpeda Rakieta powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war with all the projects military use of rocket technology to the Temporary the Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all the work of the coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Committee was based in 1937, but after two years of the activities of its activities to bring an end to the opening of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further work on the space industry, after the war in the Polish press are thanks to the work of the Polish astronautické society (the Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">The first time, there is mention of society in the November extradition year 1954 magazine Problemy, in which there are four more comprehensive articles on astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, since, Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed the creation of a society, which will deal with kosmonautikou.</seg>
<seg id="27">In that time, rozbíhaly projects artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the 1956 the Polish astronautická society (PTA) snažia for accession to the International Federation (astronautické based 1951) and no longer fall, PTA has become a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the coming year, the first President of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) has become a Vice-President of the International astronautické Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">He has carried out this function until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 PTA is an important role in the development of a very successful Meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish by a missile, which carry out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 has been completed in 1957, the first place on 10 October launch 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rocket with dostupem 1800 metres has been long and its weight around 80 cm was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later was built by an improved version RM-1A and in the summer started in 1959 Bledovské the desert flight tests two-stage rockets RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rocket were long 1.4 standards and its weight was perhaps 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Further development type of it should be able to the real scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have dostup to 14.5 km, and its task has been monitoring výškového the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962 was suspended the further development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The heir to the first type of rockets RM has become a rocket Meteor-1 vyvíjená from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">Missile was designed as dvoustupňová, its the total length was 510 height and starting weight was 32,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Were developed three types of (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) that was different sizes area for scientific appliances.</seg>
<seg id="41">In raketě Meteor-1A be available to the scope of the volume of 0.4 per litre of 0.34 Meteor-1B, on the volume and Meteor-1C, compared to the volume of a litre of.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum dostup in all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In 1965 and 1968 was in the aviation Institute the development of rockets Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket Meteor-2 should launch the weight of 380 kg and to be able to pass useful burden weighing 10 kg to the tune of around 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently were built version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Yet it is important to mention the entry of Poland to COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also in the framework programme Interkosmos involved in the space research area in the Soviet artificial družicích and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski become from Vladimir Remek the second interkosmonautem.</seg>

<seg id="9">Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation of producers are trying to import cheap goods to cope with competition by the 'podrazí' the price of competitor to tear down the greater share of the market and thus increase their profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a massive scale, this means for the majority of businesses either translate production abroad, or there buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in the countries where the price of work in comparison with other economies high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the private capital has no social responsibility and therefore the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising necessarily the social state spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">The whole situation is particularly the absolute unwillingness by entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to replace the economic and social a social damage which has done in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reckless practices of private capital create in the individual economies situation, when governments of individual countries are forced to enter the competition with the aim of artificially to reduce social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments give the private capital risking their own population regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This manifests itself, in particular, the changes to the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is economically to force their own population adopted price diktat of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is happening, on the one hand, the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and limiting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the West have existed for many years of public výdejny for the poor, who cannot own work to feed.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already in million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the framework of the increasing the competitiveness of the German economy are routinely to cases that properly employed people receive such a wage that they must pay to the subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was published in the case of the Federal auxiliary staff Reichstag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures of practically all the southern EU countries inevitably lead to the same situation, where people are under pressure from the disastrous decline of the social level of forced to either to emigrate as was the case in the 19th century, or živořit for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that in the country might one day will come private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But here we need to ask where but to come?</seg>
<seg id="26">If this will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or the Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian or African still work for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This concerns the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and the media in the constituencies claim that the state cannot participate in the capital to their own economy that command economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state must not managing intervention to interfere in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then we need to ask whether the private capital, does not affect, now actually govern policy and the state in their own egoistickém sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is a clear answer yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and in all Member States of the presence of lobbies.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual advantages, the legislations, where it is virtually everything reprehensible, but nothing.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the West, the situation is such that the State Department for a lack of financial resources commissioned by the drafting of the laws of the private legal companies, which are mostly in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These proposals of the laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All the power of this is not from the people as it says the Constitution of the Western kind, but of the financially strong groups preferujících own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear now that a liberal democracy is now quickly into the situation, as it describes Appiános in my book The crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Julius Caesar and Pompeia: 'State has already been long in total disintegration and authorities took over the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">In bribes, the illegal obtaining love and for the help of the cornerstones of or of swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption bujely without hindrance and people coming to the elections with beforehand prodaným voice '...' charakterní people on the office neucházeli, so no one was as a result of this disruption has become the eight months without konzulů '....' Začalo is indeed to talk about the fact that the only cure in bad the situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to adopt strong man. "Appiános is thought to Pompeia, but it has become a Caesar, which has lasted democracy to also to enjoy self-government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">In conclusion, Like antice is the current society based on the reckless preference for their own benefit without regard to reach an society-wide interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is inherently able to understand and apply to reach an society-wide favour of.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now, as well as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform the deeper nature.</seg>
<seg id="43">Design of fascist and communist regimes, we must therefore seek in reckless the liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current situation can be the demise of these systems in favour of the democracy of a liberal type seen as a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Particularly disastrous is the fact that the elites completely ignored in the future of the possible statisícové loss of life, the humanitarian and social disaster that we have already seeing now, together with the crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The abolition of the law on public work is not the solution, at least not permanent.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition at international, and the Interior European level will the government of the Czech Republic to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore logical.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen capital participation of the State in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">The situation for the US administration did not offer a positive outcome of the Shah - thrown overboard could not afford, because it would fundamentally threaten the trust of the allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="6">This was a blow for the prestige of the United States, which later was deepened fiasco attempt to free the hostages force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The imprisonment of diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, then what the negotiations to alžírská government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their plight at home sparked a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran has contributed significantly to the defeat of the Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections 1980.</seg>

<seg id="10">Film režírujícího actors Ben Afflecka Argo describes the one episode of the history of America, which brought a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before memberships Embassy from it have six workers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following the difficult peripetiích rezidenci ended up in the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, has helped while unsubstantiated nom story - went to the Canadian passports as Members of the film staff, which in the country obhlížel locations for recording with video a science-fiction velkofilmu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, who invented an expert on 'exfiltraci' Tony Mendez, require the cooperation Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To legend be credible, talked about the film project in the specialist journals, there were a press conference, the fictional productive society should the real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operations were concealed a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendeze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleckův the film is a special a combination of more genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, realistically pojatý political whodunit, at the same time, the so-called 'caper movie', the story of vydařeného stunt podrazu - an example of this can be a series of Dannyho parťáků.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the movie so by mood - on the one hand, the broad dokumentárně sequence of Tehran (in titulkové sequence are ukazovány ikonické dobové photographs of events and the way in which were the same situation shown satellite in the film - large disparities in are not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, odlehčené passages from Hollywood, pojednané with the ironic and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then the scene of the headquarters of the CIA and the other institutions -muži in suits pick up the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of, in the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Benovi Affleckovi is a remarkable that have a career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vysmívaného actors became respected Director and also its arts ceased to be the target of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is the third celovečerní film, after the dark krimi Gone The baby Gone (2007) and thrilleru City (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, this is the first Affleckův scan, which is not taking place in Boston režisérově home.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of an atmosphere of jobs was between the characteristics that režisérovy older films place over hollywoodský standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck Argu it also apparent in Tehran, where 'plays a' Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scene in the film are taking place in the streets in rekonstruování real sequence of events - the opening of the fall of the embassies is impressive in its clarity, which, at the same time recording conveys emoci confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that arise when somewhere along moving in the history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in the arenas of fabricated (a false staff to Tehran the bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many events in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The Director, to deal with vyprávěný story does not offer actually power in the film sense napínavých scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully with the little is working, sometimes, the reality of something přimyslí - there has not everything so neatly (scene in which the impending crisis in Tehran airports will call from in America and honička after overturned operate rather far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">But it is a weakness Arga roztěkanost resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are as Hollywood aides very charming, their figures, but have deserved more space and are not in the movie by far the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleckův film a bit of losing a dramatic move, it is showing that it is possible to monitor with moderate interest, to pay tribute to the implementation and retro style evoking thrillers the 1970 ’ s.</seg>
<seg id="37">But there is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of the one has a vibrant history and proof, as excessive are ideas about všemocných and vševědoucích secret services, but it will be enough.</seg>

<seg id="10">Neotáčíte turned their backs on the people who elected by you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">All the time I have said that, in the battle for the Presidency, I will go according to the outcome in the Senate elections.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I have made it clear that, if I am elected Senator, I am going to run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My aim but it is not function, as is the instrument, as I can realise their vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is why I need the greatest influence and what the strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem but it is not only that, as a nation nadáváme in a bar and television, but that the trampling on anyone who wants to try to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To join in the media, which the person dehonestují and which confuse the freedom of speech, freedom of lying.</seg>
<seg id="17">For me to be said that uplácím journalists or that I was Adviser George Paroubka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let us to your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the battle for the Presidency you pause with the proposition material and criminal liability of politicians, and the feedback property of over 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To this, you need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the President but such power and the Senate you do not only as a whole can propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you intend to resolve it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as a citizen průvodcovství lobbied for this to be free of business, to carry this through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politicking - when someone will come up with a good proposal from the left or right, naschvál to reject, and it is delaying the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nestraník I have a much greater potential to gain the support from all the parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My preference is that without the party a compartmentalised approach and dogmas, I can take something that is the best for our country, from all sides and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you see it rather as a man of the right-wing or left-wing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that I am more people are left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me is not important, if a little towards the left, or a bit of transport.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to link the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always I will support any public good solution, although it will propose the CPBM or ODS, and so I will be against a bad idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Čertíte, when someone will tell you that you are a populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But nedokazujete that what you said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When tvoříte byznysplán in a firm, so you are also an ideal objective and vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you are trying to bring.</seg>
<seg id="37">Someone this may be called populism, but all the proposals that I am referring to, in the world of work, or about them outstanding specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament you zbydou only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with the long-term nevystačíte in politics.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that, if you for people to go and to talk to them, that you will be able to impose, for example, the penal and material responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Convincing policy, journalists and the public and to try to your side to this through.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected President, is not a problem to hold televised direct transfer, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact the material and criminal responsibility for the policy, officers, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they would eventually had to say why do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">When will be strong personality, which will be pojmenovávat abuses, we can push for the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of President, this was the credit of public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Frankly, I say that I am amateur that I am neither a genius, or intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For their views and vision I am trying to seek allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">In politics, I have only just begun and for its programme I will try to gain the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">I am trying to move things alone, if this does not, for six years, I will end and I will come back to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This is a little, as would Okamura should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">No spasitel I am not.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that in one person I will not do anything, I am therefore obcházel a number of people, whether it would also who in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went for Radimem Jančurou, he refused because of the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">So I am at least support investigative journalist, Jan Lorencovou, which rozkrývala fraud in small topnými oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">He ran I agree that people are really dissatisfied, but now I am in the balance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of people not to the elections and those who followed, the majority of the elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, so we have only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People navolili the Senate, so that the changes are difficult to promote.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for their vision, such as for the direct election of the mayors or leaders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You are thinking about the establishment of their own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I am still not reflected, because I do not have time to examining the clean past every potential straníka, and that is something that I do not have the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do not have the money or for the presidential campaign, to my transparent account is only 20 000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You do not have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk about property confessions, what is it your?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Private property I augur for about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague have the plot of land for around 25 million, apartment in ten million, another apartment in eight million, a collection of artistic works for about ten million, Aston Martin, 3.5 million and damage Superb for a million and then I have a few million to account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally, Aston Martin I am therefore, that it was my klukovský dream - always much enjoyed James Bond, which was in a car, courteous to women and, at the same time, fought against the wrongs and excesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You are going Aston Martin, you have property for 60 million and you do not have the money on the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money into this power to give you do not want.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have the 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">This, I have to get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign, I have already vrazil 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsor, shows that my programme about is not such an interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I do not have the obligation to pay for their campaign.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign me in effect cover this, what I will receive senátorský pay.</seg>
<seg id="78">But it would nevyžil, for example, I could not pay son the English school, which is 30 000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to earn money, and nowhere nekandiduji.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So you will continue to do business, you can live?</seg>
<seg id="81">You have said that these activities utlumíte?</seg>
</p>

<seg id="8">This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">This stupid to resolve the situation was taken a few years ago the decision to contribute to the general education and to stand up to seven nicely pomalovaných železobetonových miniatur fictitious bridges, which are vyobrazené on euro notes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive but was not the sheer.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so town councillors know that there is no longer the only opportunity to become the masters of the statistics: we must have the library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas of rotterdamského architectural from studio MVRDV, master wildly bold sloupcových graphs and zhotovitel vtipných, often even cynical buildings, has adopted the matter with the usual for competition and on the negotiations in 2003, he appeared with five books under the arm and úšklebkem on my face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And, while the Commission still ohromeně rozhlížela around and krčila shrug, vršil an insolent Maas their not be handing out favors the size and its aktivisticky zdůvodněnou conclude the words' Milá urban communities! '</seg>
<seg id="14">So this is my proposal to Montenegro books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>

<seg id="16">It is part of revitalizačního project, which includes also underground car park, supermarket, the post and several of the surrounding residential and ordinary houses with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November was honoured with Montenegro of books second place 'Best Library of NL 2012'.</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is, moreover, the designation of the cost of Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maloměstská šeď, which has been unable to offer more than a post-modern walking zone and extraordinarily ugly the municipalities, whose White a façade of you would rather expected mlékárnu, it is thanks to the richer a bit of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, above all, it is now Spijkenisse the first public cultural build in the history of their existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A long way to book</seg>

<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: the field of eldorádo under poklopem on cheese.</seg>

<seg id="24">From all sides prosklený interiér is a positive note and transparent, podlaha from páleného kabřince and elegant street lucerny clearly express the atmosphere of public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see parkové lavičky, dog and kluky and holky, who play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere Paper, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">'Normálně is the shelves with books along fronts, and in the midst of a dark is a large space, which is usually neútulný and impersonal,' says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have the classic spatial configuration challenge the upside down and room for readers we vysunuli from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">Vnitřek Montenegro books is cleverly utilised: in the centre of the office, the Internet library, šachový club, ecological centre and ústředna house-to-house technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special potěchou are black policy on the books, which are one obložením the confines of, and sometimes one parapetem zábradlím stairs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: 'the Germans must play a greater role of the'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the decision-making process for the adoption of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa the Berlin poised to close the edge of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of a week, the first signal that would vote against the proposal for an observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained from voting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel cautious.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I think that will not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, would be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstentions, when it comes to establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This ultimately put NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is for Germany difficult to take in the case of serious international issues is a clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is the case.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, and this direction from the policy, which was so to speak, guided by the US, towards the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is all the more difficult, that the Europeans have a coherent and unified policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are therefore between the two lines.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them that they will play a more independent role, but are not are used to this.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think of it in its role as the only have, but they are on the road to 'more normal' foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">In foreign policy, which are in France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What specifically means' normal 'foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the readiness to take in the case of national interests and positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic interests of Germany are in a certain degree of other than the economic interests of other major powers, and must therefore Germany to protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Firstly, Germany has a large market outlets in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful to neodstrašilo the public, but neither the elite in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I would not like this, but nor to ascribe too great importance, this is not completely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, in any case, it plays an important role in the German thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany to damage relations with the US, when Germany in the case of both the important decisions abstentions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe and even in the US is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not think that this was a watershed as dramatic as in the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps for this are extracted Germany even some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It signals that must be considered an international player and its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, in contrast, have spoken out clearly for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are between the US and many European nations differences of opinion?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences exist in the wake of America ’ s internal policy has always.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has some secret by a great deal of sympathy for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But as a result of the political situation cannot this position, of course, a publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that the diversity of views really are not so great, as is always seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relations between Obama and the Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama somehow power is not entirely happy with Netanyahu ’ s policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany is not difficult to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that this is exactly what the Germans difficult.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and consistent European policy, which is currently not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They cannot therefore be part of a broader line and they must instead, to take things forward from its own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is what they are doing with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany would take a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Germany, of course, it is not easy, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This was always a sensitive subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think that the Germans, it is clear that must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as an important international player? wants to take a leading role at all?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still used this is still an unpleasant, and for this country is, for obvious reasons still difficult to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">When you look, for instance, on the European crisis, as always, when Germany will adopt a greater role, it will create protiněmecké sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="57">It does not facilitate the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">Indeed, this is the old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this perspective, it is Germany in a much more difficult position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable for the various neighbours and the views and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The impact of the US in European policy now is constantly falling, the EU, however, this vacuum currently nevyplňuje. Here otherwise there is?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans simply will have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Although they do not like is them uncomfortable and will do it is much neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="23">The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries run into millions, above all for expensive demonstration of products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data society for research market CLSA China with a volume of EUR 15 billion a year's third largest market luxury goods and market, which is growing quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="25">Výmazu dubious records in the register brands can be achieved, however difficult and something that cost.</seg>
<seg id="26">Management can be stretched to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells to the cases where the Court rejected claims, because the title of a vytýkaný after a long time, the duration of the 'market reality'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When is the plaintiffs misfortune must plagiátorovi even to pay, because the damage to his brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is sometimes the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Known cases concern and grafických elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, lost Daimler legal dispute with the producer of construction machinery Sany, enterprise, which recently took the German manufacturers pumps to betonovou a mixture of Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, to date, the Chinese are allowed to use emblem, similar to the star of Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Society Geely, which should buy Volvo, originally used modrobílé a logo which resembled the BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to a logo to change.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer fashionable goods Lacoste lost in China with padělateli of Hong Kong and Singapore, who is known crocodile deviously promised in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.</seg>
<seg id="36">While Známkový office CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to the very small number of employees and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year, the supposedly 'the work of the emergency situation has returned to normal'.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of raw management about the opposition fell 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Closed there were 57 000 of these cases, on the 75% more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Yet still waiting for the office 81 500 on the processing of complaints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Something against to take it is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is the case in China, are often this imponující figures.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million of the applications for the protection of the label, which is almost a third more than the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record, and it means that China podesáté for us is the list of the new applications from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This also applies to the number of all existing protective labels - there are a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 was in charges selected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simple terms, this means that every minute in the average cost 1280 renminbi, or €160.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To start against this dispute is multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">This concern for more than seven years is fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans have achieved that has been repealed its illegal production imitovaných car parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">But China ’ s padělatel ensure the rights to the label Freudenberg to continue.</seg>
<seg id="52">We failed to ourselves, as in Germany cannot be protected, says surname Hanno Wentzler, President of the company management Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">Známkový office CTMO then also order the Munich firms rejected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the other two instancích may Freudenberg domohl rights, but opponents in the dispute is fighting further still.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We need to be a terrible careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now is the issue being discussed with the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler my confidence that will lead to a good thing and praises the end of the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: 'Proceedings is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money and anxiety.'</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs cannot be measured. In the archive of companies had even see a hundred years old files, to put forward the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago society Freudenberg counterparties in vain offered 'high šestimístnou amount in euros' for the purpose of a settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">'In this, you can see, what does that mean for us,' says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will be hit, and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And this in the case, when there imitators ensure exposed the label.</seg>
<seg id="64">A Chinese manufacturers in Germany, for example, I join the label Freudenberg for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of commercial activities, the concern of the long to pay, yet managed to avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">'It is to be careful not to be a terrible,' says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He also solicitor Pattloch advises the German companies to be very careful in the trade with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on the international známková the rights of foreigners would rather. Should 'everything in any way it is worth protecting, apply in China,' says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed: if society Freudenberg in the last act of his drama of the deaths, then perhaps will have to pay for giving licensing fees own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or will we be in the disputed segment pushed from the market.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after the parents, who died on AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">HIV positive is already more than 40% of the population.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="17">70 of them attends school of the second instance.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in the language of Zulu 'vypravěč stories' or 'whoever extols'.</seg>
<seg id="21">Plynnou bantuštinou can one speak in this area, only sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost ten years nacvičuje College songs in the foreign soft speech and sometimes it is also brings back where originally come: to the South Africa.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">This was in the village of a common path for Africa in the spring 2005. Above all, however, members of the Imbongi saw many children in the streets, which was not only for parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.</seg>

<seg id="32">Initially, it was still private use of individuals, which for a few euros per year to send a child to school and to give it a hot food on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, already a year later, was founded a society of 'Voices for Africa', which has since the old of orphans after the parents, who died on AIDS, almost professionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The facts of sexually transmitted infekcích</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">That is the most serious sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="36">They belong to bakteriálním SPI syfilis, chlamydie and kapavka (gonorea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent virovými SPI, HIV, human papilomaviry, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Muňky and svrab belong to parazitárním SPI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belong to the groups most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syfilis and kapavka there are, above all, for men, who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Constitutions Robert Kocha is based on the fact that at least four of the five all cases syfilidy that have been reported in Germany, are transmitted sexual contacts between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often, chlamydiové infection trichomonády, kandidóza (blight), kapavka and human papilomaviry.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is between heterosexuálními adults with us the extended relatively little, but the roughly 20% of newly infected with HIV, for this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Between juveniles of the infection chlamydiové are significantly more often than other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">For us, moreover, between juveniles are often human papilomaviry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of people infected syfilidou, according to the Constitution of Robert Kocha 1697 diseases in 2001 to more than doubled 3698 diseases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 was around 2 700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about a tenth of less than a year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What the symptoms of the sexual disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases may cause vředy in the area of mutilation, difficulties in močení, výtok, pain in podbřišku and puchýřky or bradavice.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will remain therefore nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">The risk of contagion can reduce the use of condoms, however, do not offer 100% of the protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can partly be transferred to and infections of the mess and close the physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, the experts are recommending, especially in the case of the frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular investigation.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the event of early diagnosis is possible to cure the most SPI and to prevent the subsequent consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to the patronage, represent darům and last but not least, honorářům that the College earns zpíváním around the Germany, will be among some money.</seg>
<seg id="62">'In all, we have already to Esitjeni sent roughly EUR 200 000,' says the Chair of the club of Annette Lennartz.</seg>
<seg id="63">The money from Germany manages in the village Zodwa Dlamini, confident, the woman can impose.</seg>
<seg id="64">Care also about orphaned children find shelter, for example, in some of grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo, as in the language of Zulu says the old women, are the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have taken and 14 of orphans, give them the roof and care about children attend every day in time in uniforms to school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Children who have no one should not go to shelter to Khanyisile, solitary woman by society as well as the two kuchařky, which makes a day for more than 200 of hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">'Voices for Africa' moreover, established a school sewing, it has two kurníky and together with the American health organisations PSI zařídilo that many people in the village of HIV test allowed to do.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not granted. Although it is the disease in the whole country so clear, however, all the remaining silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The King of the 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">'AIDS is an absolute taboo,' says Annette Lennartz, 'because it has to do with the sexuality.'</seg>
<seg id="72">In fact, quite strange in a country where King officially keeps 14 of the spouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last an absolutist monarch Black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his nemírným lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This state approved by way of life is, among other things, the blame for the fact that the HIV virus in the past decades so quickly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also many migrant workers who, the virus roznesli after the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that the use of condoms, while on any corner for free, the 'but no one is not used.</seg>
<seg id="78">Culture is different - non-proprietary contact '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">At least a little to support cultural exchange, travel College Imbongi one in two, three years together for the South Africa and singing the songs full of mourning, militancy, confidence in the future and self-confidence black, which many in the southern tip of the dark continent know from the time of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">Bus full of white people who sings songs in the language of the struggle - a prize brings not only the mood and joy, but also already vyloudilo tears for many wild border soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The road is always and in the Esitjeni, where the singers visit children, over which they have the patronizing.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although this vesničku hardly you will find on the map, in the river Ezulweni is more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">'go into Esitjeni, there is light, "they say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when you go back to calculated, which is here straight line 8733 kilometres to dupajícím zpěvákům in provisionally on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that shines a light here.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">However, that there is the ultimate the south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is remote only a few kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, the Caucasus ethnic group Talyšů, of which is not very well known, in addition, that is perfectly persky and ázerbájdžánsky and dies at the very old age.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The final station is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">This city prides himself on too monumental architecture of the Soviet times, which is in a scenic the mountain landscape somehow not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe failing here. The arrival of Azerbaijan ’ s capital city Baku is too difficult.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 323 kilometres is needed, eight hours, since the roads is only jednoproudová.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fabulous wealth, for which countries owe naftě in the Caspian Sea, still not here to the countryside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is, however, convinced that Lerik it has to become a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Baku in May famous the price of the Eurovision Song Contest - and we have the next year we will have a festival the oldest people in the world,' says Fatulajeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is the head of the Museum of longevity, about a single in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here is documented the lives of nearly eight dozen Talyšů of the environment, who are older hundred years. Fatulajeva shows the black and white foto.</seg>

<seg id="27">'Narodil in the area of 1805 and 1973 died, the' explains Fatulajeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">This man was supposedly three times ženat and 23 of the child. In the age of 136, even a daughter.</seg>

<seg id="35">Currently, there are 20 people who are older 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">So why live here in the south of so many years of the people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Azerbaijan guide Farid Mugimzadeh this explains the special genes Talyšů.</seg>
<seg id="38">The head of museums Fatuljeva on the contrary, they believe that this lies in the diet.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, the fact that it is restricted diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of whom a day drink a glass rozpuštěného butter, it is so healthy, from bromatologického point of view, it is plausible.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="6">Let this week to lie.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you will get a sense paralysing stench rakfisku, one of the greatest the Norwegian delikates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in a small town Fagernes, roughly three hours since the Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is the snow, a wonderful perspective - and in the air a pervasive stench.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is nasolený pstruh kvašený in the water for a maximum period of one year - depends on how much you want to fish páchla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As stmívá and it is becoming the coldness are here in the Norwegians Fagernes meet the festival privy this, as to say that the best, nejpodmanivějšímu food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This "dreaming raw and then zapijete full aquavitu, 'says Havard Halvarsen, local professional a fire-fighter, but also the so-called' Rakfisk General ', which is responsible for the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people are eating small bar of fish and with it is a huge amount of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">'Some people have a rather than rakfisk aquavit,' says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Can drink stench override them.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few scraps of I will try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it is not so bad - this is a bit, sushi, which was in a long way by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is a very different times, when it was in Norway poverty, and because there were a fridge, fish in the fall in namáčely vzduchotěsných casks with water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the middle of winter, when they were well zkvašené, vytáhly and snědly - senses undoubtedly blunt alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation have been thousands of Norwegians have achieved forced to leave their country and seek work, while the majority have emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants přilákaní a great deal of work, high earnings and large-scale care system.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Swedish people, old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, are flowing into the country to work.</seg>

<seg id="25">Even though expensive is all - a small a glass of beer or sendvič you will come to 9 of pounds ($14) for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway in worldwide reports often absent - and it seems that the majority of the population that suits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The name of the right-wing extremists, Anders Breivik, racist, which in the last year, shot 77 men, women and children, people still only grudgingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, the shooting called 'the event of 22 July'.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians can only hard to believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Norway's wealth lies behind the current growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970 of the twentieth century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">'But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,' says in the talířů with uleželým rakfiskem our dressed Anna, which, with its long hair blond and surprisingly blue eyes of our eyes is a prototype nordického well-being.</seg>

<seg id="34">Nepředvádíme, do not like the pomp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway deals with his oil wealth very cautiously - apart from a small percentage is the most money from this sector invested in a special fund for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When all the other in the years leading to the global financial crash threw money, which should not, the Norwegians should šňůrky on its měšci firmly utažené.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="37">'For as long as we can in the winter skiing and in the summer to go on trips, we are happy, "says the Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">'A to eat rakfisk,' gives with bezstarostným laughingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in the snow in the queue to something to eat - rakfisku I have had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such a losí burger is certainly something else, and it is so beautifully šťavnatý.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But this evening is stinking fish, in turn, here.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, in which I live, is one of many jobs, which gives rakfisk to dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for smart the most demanding fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">The combined with a TV transfer, in which is an interlocutor with motýlkem surrounded by plate with rakfiskem.</seg>

<seg id="1">My crisis mexicko-americké identity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It says that many people have been forced to leave the Mexico from the lack of the possibilities that are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those left; remind them of the difficult times, says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are lapeni between the two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In the last trip to the capital of Mexico I barely prodral the mob and arrived I am in the space for the agenda of immigrants, where I came across the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Šipky showed to one of the two fronts: one for 'Mexicanos' ('Mexicans') and the second for 'Extranjeros' ('aliens').</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there a few seconds and I did not know where I have to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in the middle of California, and the whole life, I was called the 'Mexičanem'.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston call 'the Irish' and my friends in New York ourselves referred to as' the Italians'.</seg>
<seg id="10">So I later ended in the Mexican American '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in my home děda was not necessary to use the acronyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am speaking Spanish well enough to manage both sides of the interview in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">I am, however, the stock of rodilého speaker and I cannot rid of the US přízvuku.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I am out their American passport and Front for the 'Extranjeros'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I was thinking about the moment when this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pen Nieto President Obama visited in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda should the usual Affairs, which is a, when leaders meet these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pen Nieto I would also talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same chance that Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as that they travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">It wants to join with the United States and Canada and to create in North America trade bloc a similar the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pen Nieto promised that will continue in Mexico ’ s war against the drug cartels, although not provided any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico is the relationship with the United States of the complicated and full of hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never nepomyslela to the fact that in 1848, the United States had Mexico, and to force its leader under the threat of weapons rewrite half of the Mexican territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who is thinking in the space of centuries, not minutes, are the comments of ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So a minute, after the United States will say something a little critical for Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican of the press and among the elite complaints that, as the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And children Montezumy moving on the path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet it is for Mexico the real challenge to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about the hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">It is a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico are winners and losers, the people, which offers the possibility of the country, and others, which not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with the Mexican roots are living in cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that, in a point of our family tree a person, perhaps parent or prarodič in Mexico, which was denied the opportunity and had to go to the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">And, more often than it would appear, this person in line with the profile - tmavá skin, weak education, the origin of the poor villages, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are against them loyal.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even if we are now the American dream, go to the good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class us does not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">This feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and look at us as inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexico ’ s.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is in their view, only a failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico neselhaly, so it would never did not desert.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we are now nenalézali imprisoned for Silk Curtain, with a good life in the United States, but also yet lost dušemi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and in childhood legally přicestovala to the United States, reminds me of that, between the Mexicans and by the Mexican the Americans, because there is more Mexicans understand, and Mexican Americans who are not resent.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if it is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And, at the same time, many of the Mexican Americans, which I know, they do not feel as part of either.</seg>
<seg id="48">Love poslech Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte region, but also Bruce Springsteena.</seg>
<seg id="49">You will receive the best of both countries, but the roots of you have in either.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico to us are seen as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we have seen as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And that relations even more complicated, they want some of the Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I heard again in its journey together with diasporou.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to Mexican the Americans have worked for Mexico as a 'provisional ambasadoři' and, Mexico ’ s interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American fellow citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and push for the political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">No.</seg>
<seg id="56">Therefore, this does happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, thanks to the inequalities of revenue and a widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us is not certain that it is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it is up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States, as discussed with Mexico before one and half a century ago, must accept the fact that some of the Mexican Americans still feel displeasure for the way in which was discussed with their family members in significantly closer to the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we have more 'Mexicans', before I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">The old battles, the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The end of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas would even could be an uncertain basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can sometimes be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of the bloodshed, suggests that any such is happening is futile.</seg>
<seg id="5">Between the usual unnecessary rumours about who began, there were many buildings changed in the rubble, killed more than 140 of the Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and the first time. The rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of Tel Aviv, the Israeli cities, and in the Holy City of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even if it appears that the Israelis and Palestinians are stranded in its ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East are changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and Israelis, whatever they like it or not, are engaged in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will mean that their struggle will be even bloodier than ever.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that it can to interrupt their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither vyhraná, or lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first sight it seems that is not currently the many reasons to optimizmu.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if a cease-fire closed 21 November sustain the fight for this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that reigns in Gaza since 2007, to say that the Israelis will be forced to retreat, even if Gaza been defeated.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing several leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the poorest global and the most populous parts of the planet, with Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another bit of Palestine, which is currently managed its are ardent rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well conclude that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Islamists throughout the Arab world have more influence, so Hamas won the rich and powerful friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, znovuvzkříšená regional power, which was once the Muslim ally Israel, with the side of the Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering people from Hamas say that Islamic Crescent spans around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where there is a party / militias Hezbollah, Syria, where the rebels, who are still more inclined to islamizmu can remove Bashar al-Assad, and Jordan, where allies Hamas threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on the southern Israel ’ s end of the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood has changed under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and core of the Arab countries, the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, secular tyrant, which in Egypt ruled 30 years until his fall in 2011, not on Hamas time.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, Brotherhood is bratrancem Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomacy can Hamas appear as a player who cannot be excluded or Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the contrary, the Israeli hardliners to run out in the opposite of the conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the military terminology was Hamas been put back into the boxes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel ’ s anti-missile system of the Iron kopule proved its worth and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israelis can better to sleep - at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="28">In a diplomatic terminology, America is just as consistent pattern as always. Many European countries also vinilo Hamas from the opening of the last round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And, above all - Israel to prosper, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who ignored by the majority of the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004, was killed around 30 Israelis in Israel relatively calm from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall, which is interfering in the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements, which is still growing despite its illegality before the international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose the Likud party at the start of the campaign for the elections held on 22 January teamed up with even more radical group led by Mr Lieberman, it is in good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why coddle these treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If it really was ruled by in the West Bank, so would neodpalovali missiles, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better if we keep on the walls and praštíme is, when vystrčí heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will have won, but the Arab Spring can to change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, not Israel too in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israel ’ s defense spending are higher than spending all its four Arab neighbours together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Opening of new war with local superpower hardly helps new Arab governments uzdravit its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that President Mursí worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, is a good sign, and can mean the beginning of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also the Israelis would be to the situation should look in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a denial of rights to the Palestinians to self-determination sud keg, which must one day in the areas of the occupied Israel explode - as well as the bus that last week exploded in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Already in the present time repression weaken in Jewish state of democracy and demography this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attacks against Gaza konající every few years in order to drive Hamas will be still more to select the diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need incentives from outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is what we preach reasonable people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and these newspapers: two States, when Israel went territory for reasons of safety.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from outside of at least a little bit more influence on the enforcement of this matter.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar must put a stop to the supply of arms into Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of the Jewish state, based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Arabs from outside must also press for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would for the creation of a Palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer virtual state sovereignty in the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama has also on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In my first term overlooking the presentation of its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House, seems to be as reluctance in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the world of connections is not so bad be znuděný</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The last Day díkuvzdání I am being spent five hours at the airport, when the plane should our mechanical difficulties and we have had to wait for the arrival of even further the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we have had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">You will not lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Waiting half a day at the airport to another years is irritating, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iPhonem (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on the development of the increasingly come with praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that, for US (and our children) is good is sometimes be boring.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has forced the brain to go to the interesting guidelines, which can to promote creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And, given that most of us today is continually added to a screen, we do not have the chance to enjoy the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We should therefore ennui to support?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will come back to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, as well as many people I assumed that nuda is relatively new phenomenon, which happened with the arrival of the more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as Peter Toohey, a professor of the Greek and Roman the history of the Canadian University in Calgary, which is the author of the books Boredom: and Lively History (History boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'In fact, has nuda a long history,' said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompejích was found in the Latin saying on boredom, coming from the first century AD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then it is also the question of how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that have been defined and discussed many different ways, John D. Eastwood said, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontariu in Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After a research literature and bringing the idea of the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define the boredom as experience 'I wanted to do something that I am satisfied, but I was not capable of'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Nuda apathy different from that person is not involved in nothing, but I would be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that there is no urge to do something for apathy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It says that at the heart of boredom is' the disruption of the process of attention, combined with bad mood and a sense of slowly ubíhajícího time '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nuda can a lot of the depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But a professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a mutual relationship, have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while the people who are in a depression, see the problem alone in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think we are bored, I am going to when we only have difficulties with.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its study 'The Unengaged Mind: Boredom in Defining Terms of attention', which was in September, published in the Perspectives he Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed out earlier experiment, in which the participants have listened to the ribbon that person read an article from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard loud and television programme in the room, others it heard so quietly, it barely noticed that, while the third group did not hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who television programme heard silent, hlásili boredom, more than the other two groups - have difficulties with, but were not sure why and giving these difficulties boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you are trying to focus on the difficult or exciting task, can lead to distortions of boredom, said Mark J. Fenske neuroscience, a professor at the University of Guelph in Ontariu and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when you are doing something nudného, as it is the search for a bad components on factory line, can help with the distraction of music to nenudili '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, we now know that shaking and čmárání, which are often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with the use to fight and to keep people physically attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">'Research shows that children, which is allowed to wag, the more they learn and keep more information than those that are forced to sit in the calm,' said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We have all experienced - sometimes ennui my flight delays, hučící reproduktor, particularly the lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals have a greater chance to be boring than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">For assistance with measurement of boredom scientists in the 1980 ’ s developed 'scale for susceptibility to nudění' (Boredom Proneness SCALE).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes issues such as: 'For many things that I have to do is repeated and is monotónních,' and 'I have many interests, that I do not have the time it is all to do'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Through these scales scientists have found that boys tend to be boring, more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich said, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for human and social development of the University of Illinois, by the experiment, in which the seven to eight times a day contacted the almost 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">Found that 32% of young teenage said nudili in school and in doing domestic tasks, while 23% said nudili, if they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3% of parents have said that nudili.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said that they do not know whether the percentage of boredom has now been, 21 years later, more or less.</seg>
<seg id="44">But, said that he knows that the 'maturation is the time for the boredom', which is largely due to the fact that the children and young people is not made much control of what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: 'It is for you nuda good?'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, played a gambling or abused addictive substances as a way as to relieve it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers the discussion on the link between the use and creativity, Professor Vodanovich said that the problem has studied for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">'nuda is the way the brain, as you say that you should do something else,' said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always the best thing that you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If the nudíte and use this energy to gambling on kytaru and cooking, you will do this.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you will watch television, do you not pleased at the moment, not only in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So, if your child nudí and you will give him iPad, it will not be boring, but nenaučí, as is itself to take or separately, Professor Fenske said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And the 'this independent governance is being transferred from one of the situation on the other,' said Professor.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child does not learn how only as itself, but will be greater self-restraint in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we should not be too critical of it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable, when we have from the reach of constant drnčení activities and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">'we are accusing it of the need to be boring is even more, but nuda is painful, restless, the desire to be associated with something meaningful,' said.</seg>
<seg id="60">What in fact, people are looking for, say, is the way is to mobilise and see and enjoy during leisure time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">'In the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní,' said, 'it is difficult to find ways to commandeer, when the noise vypne'.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado there is no a handbook on the new law on marihuaně</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Devatenáctiletý, Anthony Orozco, student at higher professional school and player from south-east Colorada, face charges of the offences for something which will soon be in the state of legal - for the possession of a few grams of cannabis and dýmky, which used to its smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Orozco said that a September day went with few mates in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansasem, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a policeman found in a car smoked cannabis, it was Mr Orozco issued subpoenas for possession of drugs and equipment to the use of drugs - minor offences, for which it is for every $100 a fine - and he was set a date of the Court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">'behave to us as to criminals,' said Mr Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In precarious weeks after coloradském the vote on the legalisation of small quantities of cannibas for recreational use of the answer depends hundreds of minor drug rather than on the law on the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for the possession of cannabis has already been here and in Washington State, which was approved by a similar measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police separation to stop blaming adults in the age of 21 years and the elderly in possession of a small amount of which will be legally authorised after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the prosecutors in konzervativnějších districts Colorada said that will continue with the existing cases concerning cannabis, and still blame for the possession of people.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities from the suburbs Denveru towards the Western horám is voting to prevent the opening of new, state licencovaných deals with marihuanou in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">'This issue develops so quickly that I do not know what will happen next,' said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, East of Denveru.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Heads of the drbou and regulators in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="14">And look for guidance as to set the system of licences for growing, production, distribution and sale of - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that, Colorado, whether in a good or for worse, it is more advanced than the majority of the States in the regulation of cannabis, firstly for medical use, and now and recreational.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'Colorado has more regulated market, and so will be a good guide,' said Brian E. Smith, the spokesman for the Council for licensing the sale of alcohol state Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, as Mr Smith recognized no place or system cannot do more than to propose, what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">'There is no real precedent, according to which we could manage,', he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, the so-called I-502, is to take effect on 6 December, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which will still not be a national licensing system, but legal holding yes.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, for example, how to balance the law on 'appropriate' approach to a licensed marihuaně with its ban on trade with konopím to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's fields or child centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">'Nowhere will not be more difficult to locate licencovaný trade with konopím than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,' said Ben Livingston, the Speaker of the Centre for legal cannabis, recently based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November sent police chief Oates from the city Aurora its officers an e-mail in which they have already announced that urban Prosecutor will not prosecute offences for the possession of a small amount of cannabis for every citizen of the older 21 years and that the police 'with immediate effect' stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police will promote the urban laws regulating growers medical marijuana, and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In County Weld in northern Colorado represents a district prosecutor, Ken Buck stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, that his Office will continue to prosecute cases possession of cannabis, the majority as a way to press for users, to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently face charges of the possession of 56 grams or less cannabis 119 people, even if many of them are facing further accusations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">'Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences, which was crimes in a time when they occurred,' said Mr Buck in your statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was complicated even in places such as rural district Mesa, where the voters rejected marihuanovou initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in the Grand Junction, the largest city district, already adults blame for the possession of a small amount of.</seg>
<seg id="30">District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to her possession of all the ongoing cases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">'I do not think that the lost their time continuing in the law enforcement, as long as it does not change,' said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While 55% of the plains of voters supported measures, bringing the recreational cannabis into the arms of the government and legal system will never be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory responses across state revealed with regard to the large state green experiment deep division between local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For the district prosecutors this is the 'cultural barriers', he said, Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denveru, which represents the accused of the possession of cannabis, and local the spokesman for the National Organisation for the reform of the laws on cannabis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">'spend so much of his life to the persecution of people that they still do not really to accept that it is legal,' said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first States, which is to a small amount of cannabis are as to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on track to national testovacími cases to legalise drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and national authorities are planning a new border for regularised the sale and, at the same time, scrupulously waiting instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and the cultivation of cannibas for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Defenders of the legalization of cannabis hope that the justice complies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several arrests clerks of cannibas for medical purposes and patients who use, which have attracted the attention, allowed the majority of the federal government, business with the medical marihuanou in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 States in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While protidrogoví agents will probably not forcing the door to since none have been picked up a little poke of with the drug, it is likely that the state ’ s allowing regulated deals with recreational marihuanou permitted new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former advisor in counter-narcotics policy administration of President Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">A few plains of cities it is not waiting for the procedure of the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the election day some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marihuanou, even though it will take even about a year before it can any trade open.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the city Montrose in the west of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">'We do not want to be in a situation where someone we spend the licence and then for this we have the large federal issue,' said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our Community voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are looking at it, what they voted for Community, compared to what has become.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="2">For four of the euro gamble nosiči in the area of the volcano with his life and health, when they endure 70 kilogram of sulphur down the steep brick-and-mortar stezkách.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">People are, for which it is their work hell, and are some who literally work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living conquering the sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Jáva.</seg>
<seg id="5">This must every day fárat up to the bottom kráteru, where escape sirné gases from vnitřku the earth and in contact with the air of turning into a solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After vyseká large blocs of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 kilo, affecting the is on the shoulders in two bambusových baskets after the steep brick-and-mortar stezkách.</seg>
<seg id="7">On top of the volcano which tower 2 386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but vyčerpaným nosičům has lasted for over 40 minutes to drift the pace of a tortoise up because they maintain the balance and thoroughly rozvažují their action to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any klopýtnutí could become a life, as it has one of the French turistce years ago, which fell from skal Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which are extracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When they are up, leading the way around tourists who is fotografují as monkeys the circus and tired odnášejí difficult basket of the weight that mining company has put a bit further, in altitudes 1850 metres.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in a live volcano benefit from 1960 and never their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents per kilo of sulphur.)</seg>
<seg id="12">It is then sold at 10 000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this nerost has its place in the everyday life and is used for the production of matches, entertaining pyrotechniky dynamitu, cosmetics, and even in the approach of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">'As is routinely wear 70 kilo, first, around 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for any way' explains Anto us, which normally taking three avenues on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way it takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but can thus make 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what would be made in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">'daily wage miners there is a very high. For example, for the collection of coffee is 15 000 rupees (EUR 1.2) for the day and pay for fourteen days is two million rupees (EUR 167),' explains nosič, which previously worked on the tourism the island of Bali as zedník.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary 75 000 rupees (EUR 6.2) for the day and work has been so hard, but Anto returned to their family to Banyuwangi, village near the eruption of the serious reason, which is in Indonesia as strong as síra: 'oženil I have with the young dívkou of the Bali, which is Hindu, and I have taken it to Jávu that converted to Islam'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, poorly it breathes, still does not and eyes has fractious toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In its 27 years Anto three times a day is risking life in a live volcano Kawah Ijen, whose síra, it has already begun to collect their tax, even though it faces protected special the guise of and spectacles.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has asthma, poorly it breathes, still does not and eyes has fractious toxic gases which are disappearing from volcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price that must pay for it to get his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">'I will work even two years, because I want to open up trade or study Spanish or French,' promises more than the American-educated Karadzic raged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This fine and intelligent man stižený fate could be tourist guide, číšníkem or recepčním in a hotel, and instead, it is doing the work of the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shares the dirty wooden chatrč with other nosiči wakes up and every day in the two hours in the morning, because síra in the night continues to build up and its characterised by yellow paint is changing in the blue and September rather.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the rest of light fárá Anto into kráteru and highlights the way a small svítilnou, which has připevněnou on helmě and myself it as their money to buy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 of recorded media yields on the shoulders of the sírou from the trough kráteru</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has its high incomes, the extraction of sulphur because of the cost savings nezmechanizovala, nor does not provide nosičům workers on their own and with such efforts, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, do not receive the share of the 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the surcharge applied for the photographing, which, together with a passport for 15 000 rupees (EUR 1.2) collect hlídači natural fleet from tourists who come to took photos of the volcano and its human muly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">'This work is for livestock, and not for the people' notes Madrusin, a 42-year old statný nosič who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since left school.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">Unainik, which balances its basket on the back, in their own 53 years can do it only 50 kilogram of.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his colleagues vydolují in a live volcano 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three lorries odvážejí a sharp a path between houštím in storage in Tamansari distant 18 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="35">'I will not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano was my entire life,' States Unainik and opens up while broadly lips, in which there is a lack of a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">From his five sons, the oldest, a 30-year, also makes dolováním of sulphur.</seg>

<seg id="12">We knew that the government attempted to a lot of things like to extend perfume with feromony or organise meet-up parties.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas could be a creative, but not entirely operational.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why do the most creative possible thing, as is the composition of rapu, in order to resolve this problem. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Anyone who does not take the power of lightly, is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Spends USD 1 300 per year to encourage citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Government package for marriage and family provides up to 15 000 dollars on the child, extending maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">All these measures should but little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is rich city state with advanced technologies in the South-East Asia, also known konzervatizmem of its leaders and strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the distribution of the population is currently 1.2 of children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most recently exceeded fertility rates the value of 2, which is regarded as the rate of recovery plan, in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why, in fact, Singapurci do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Mingová, the Department of marriage and family of the National Authority for the population is that this is because of the 'better education' and 'to a wider range of career opportunities'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The 'People have available a wider range of possibilities in terms of the objectives and priorities, it is not only the marriage and family,' explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of free people and to postpone marriage and bring children into existence. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">While in the framework of the immigration policy existed efforts drastically increasing the flow of immigrants as measures against the population decline, between the local population that has given rise to resentment.</seg>
<seg id="28">On some of the Singapore website is to see the overt xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year has seen the government party Singapore its worst election result from the beginning of independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election was trying to tackle the problem with the help of the quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unforeseeable consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is seeking to nestavělo as many small home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, has begun to influence the trade in real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Office for urban development started to regulate the number of small housing censuses known as' box from the shoes', which can build in certain urban areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These flats have the area of 46 metres Square and have a great success in prodejnosti.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">'There are popular, and so that are sold on the days and weeks faster than the houses with greater area.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is why they are for our money flow of a much better '.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="42">Too become stressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although this new rules could seek to increase the birth rate of the nation, conversation with Singapurci workers in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will have a great effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">'The people are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, because it postpones the many people, "says the young officer.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The key issues</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and absolventka the field of education and teaching, considers that children and adolescents in the social networks rightly put, must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">It states that: 'The Internet has emerged as a means for the search for information, but when there were social networks, has changed the rules of the game'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky graduate pedagogiky at Yale University, and the author of Article Digital natives and the digital immigrants, introduce these terms, to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">'Digital natives are children and young people who were born in a time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We have the digital immigrants, who is we need to learn, and yet they only learn, 'says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Explains that it is a difficult subject, 'because we ask them to rozeznávali what is appropriate to spread, and to say, and on the contrary, what not, in an age when to this are not yet zralí'.</seg>
<seg id="46">Also, to be - as regards the environment - rozvážní, at a time when what is most eager to be oblíbení, have thousands of friends and think about the consequences of the 'gives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to this specialistky is the most effective way, as children and dospívajícím to show what it is of privacy, put questions, which is forcing to think.</seg>
<seg id="48">'To say to them, are doing something, is not working,' gives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that you would not choose stranger nevyprávěl, so why this děláš on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or this: we would have those if someone published tvou own photo, as you are those published kamarádovu?</seg>
<seg id="51">As you know, on the other publish?</seg>
<seg id="52">When označuješ fotkách of persons at the celebrations, you asked for permission from these people?</seg>
<seg id="53">And even one: the need to constantly all know what has just děláš?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is, to realise that we must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">'Putting people outside the Internet by respect, morals and other principles and the same this should be on social networks, "says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Supervision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, university professor, a teacher at first instance, and educational adviser explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">'If understand každičké záludnosti, they have a good basis for the children were saying about the consequences that the establishment of the bill on the Internet can have.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, with regard to the age or what is allowed to share or to publish, 'says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remember the children of the traditional rule 'nemluv to strangers'.</seg>

<seg id="4">The boy this before the family concealed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Decided to take their illness itself on their shoulders and start of information. And with such commitment that has already celebrated its 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of Units nejdávnějších HIV patients in hospital in Guadalajara Justice (HCG), which came in 1994 after several fighting with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio live with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was unthinkable in the early 1990 ’ s, when there were a lot of doubt, the little treatment options and the greater the stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then it is neither the director of the clinics of the Institute of social security (IMSS) nerozloučil ', because had řeznou blow'.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then have the AIDS has been synonymous with the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and fully to live.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is a lot of people who do not know about their illness and come when the virus caused devastation organism and vysílil immune system, and then the victims of random infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since the world have AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, 'means a great success that life expectancy of the patient, timely and appropriate manner will begin with the treatment, is exactly the same as for the healthy people said', Jaime Andrade Villanueva, the Civic Units HIV in the hospital in Guadalajara, with the fact that this information has been confirmed in April this year in prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and specialist of HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that, since 2008 AIDS is not the judgment of the penalty, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability the immune system of patients, which is a disease diagnosed with better are those who are taking drugs: people with 200 cells CD4 can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cells CD4 up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that those who are HIV are diagnosed in 25 years, can these findings', with respect for the treatment to live without the problems of up to 75 years', he explained in an interview a doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To highlight this progress is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died on AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 the 862 in 2011 (ročenka the Joint Programme for HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the appearance of AIDS killed in national statistics 60% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the state Jalisco died in 2011 255 of people and in May of this year, so far, 187. However, since 2005 is a universal access to antiretrovirotikům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why continue to people die on the consequences of the disease?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - 'It seems to me that the problem is not in the opportunities for access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is the way I see that this is happening with us in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the last 12 years we have not run out of the medical supplies. The problem is that patients are in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the situation of the infection, or in the late stage of the disease. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It adds convincing figure: '9 of the ten patients, when it comes to show some into the infection. The only what is needed, so that we can do more to influence the overall mortality, is a disease previously diagnose, and it is therefore to be in a large scale to offer tests on the findings of the disease to all persons, which may request them'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal corresponds to the specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state Jalisco and directly to patients as Fabrizio, which came to do tests in the private laboratories, simply because he has done his friend, and despite its low age for it already erupted AIDS and also suffered from Kaposiho sarkomem, cancer, which is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">'It will change, when you know that you have the AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that nothing further umřou, and do not want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">'If I have to die, rather the three times a week vyřádím, "they say, but this is not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, a healthy, cvičím, I take medicines'.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, his parents knows only that suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">'Žiju a normal life as anyone.</seg>
<seg id="30">I am working, I have a lot of activities, I am travelling, have been active sex life, but responsibly, I watch out for themselves and on the other person 'lists Fabrizio, which adopted a challenge to share their experience with daily MILENIO JALISCO that today, within the World AIDS Day sending their testimony those who are afraid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">'The tests whether they do. The risk, so be it knows as soon as possible, whether they are HIV positive, it is better, and whether they were diagnostikováni, whether they realise that they can live as anyone else, when will be responsible'.</seg>
<seg id="32">This sums up his message to the motto of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The end of condoms</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between programmes for the health and the ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Salazar, Ricardo guadalajarský journalist, which reveal information about the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the largest gaps are in the prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places that this task to the 'is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before us give one or two, today give us the packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who have on condoms approach', said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Between nejnáchylnějšími to new infections are adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="2">So, it seems that the procedures the restructuring of companies, which allow the Mexican laws in the country pruhů and stars in spite of international agreements is not true.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the vote would achieve about 45% to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This figure does not take into account the Court of Cassation.</seg>
