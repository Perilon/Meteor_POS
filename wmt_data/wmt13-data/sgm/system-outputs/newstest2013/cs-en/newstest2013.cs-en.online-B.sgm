<h1>
<seg id="1">The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify their policies need to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennan Center but such fraud calls the myth that voter fraud in the U.S. is less frequent than the number of people who die by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, moreover, for the last ten years, the only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain : this new provision will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures partly undermine America's democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike in Canada, the U.S. federal organization responsible for the election of the States.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult selection process, or register on the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon experienced a boom after the elections in November 2010, during which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently, it was only in 2011 presented 180 proposals for laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New election laws require voters to submit photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">These laws also limit the period for the elections in advance invalidate the right to enter the list of voters on election day and take away the right to vote to people with a criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to submit photo identification p≈Økazu any U.S. state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">Upheld the constitutionality of the Indian Act in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican authorities rushed to extend this procedure to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years to support proposals such laws in 34 states to force voters to present photo identification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that unlike Quebec U.S. citizens have universal identity, such as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, owned 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people aged be chosen, no identity card with photograph issued by their state government.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, no such identity card about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">Acquisition of the required proof of identity in addition they are often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes below$ 35,000, 18% of those aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years are therefore not required photo identification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students who are as famous for their voters shift to democratic candidates in several states are authorized to use your photo ID issued by their school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting and fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates, cards issued by these clubs to use during elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, did not require any state in the election proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such requirement introduced Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen states adopted laws that require voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures clearly aimed at reducing the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.</seg>
<seg id="31">It should be noted is that two of the three Hispanics prefer Democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators in 2011 supported in eight states laws that cancel registration of voters on election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.</seg>
<seg id="34">These limitations have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the general elections in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register about 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Measures taken after 2009 but caused a decline in the writing of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican lawmakers then in five other states have enacted laws aimed at shortening the time period for the elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in this state was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">For Hispanics was the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They were a mere 11% of all voters, but 24% of people voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, whites, who constituted 76% of all voters accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Against the pass laws which restrict voter registration, of course, very strongly opposed Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors blocked the veto several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">Damages they managed to partially limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph taken just 16 of the 34 states.</seg>
<seg id="47">Newly established rules, however, quite undeniably more difficult in 2012, the exercise of voting rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics talking mainly about bias laws passed and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the election results in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">Report Brennan Centre from 2011 shows that states where these laws were approved, representing 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is already certain : this new provision will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures partly undermine America's democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detection of prostate cancer : complete examination or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Test PSA brought sometimes erroneous results that were false negative or even false positives, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="3">All this has increased the reluctance of men who are already reluctant to investigate all go.</seg>
<seg id="4">To be examined or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the U.S. showed high levels of contamination between the different groups tested, it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time in Europe, noted differences in mortality between patients who underwent examination, and those who did not go to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also demonstrated after 12 years apart, that those who do not go to investigate, they have a 30-40% higher risk of metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend that examination from age 50 or 40 years, if your direct relative had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Vulnerable groups are also men of African origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to make the right decision when the cancer is discovered.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive cancers and those species that are inert.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to properly explain the patient's level of dangerousness of the type of cancer, offer him alternatives, necessarily not treat prostate cancer that has no long-term impact on the lives and focus in these cases rather active disease surveillance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, a number of men whose cancer was diagnosed, treated, because of their type of cancer is aggressive and is not hazardous to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We design them rather implementation of active surveillance in case of disease progression will offer them treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater accuracy establishes criteria to help you decide which type of treat and which not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless therefore recommend testing completed.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is important however to complete a medical interview and determine whether it is appropriate to take the examination or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Association of Urology Movember movement created a tool that lets you evaluate the pros and cons of PSA examination.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">prevention of disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce disease risk acceptance principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and sufficiently moved, you could prevent up to 30% of cancer cases.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If everyone quit smoking, this figure rose by at least 50%," emphasizes Andr√© Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers causes inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Any percentage also remains completely unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The Canadian Society for Research on Cancer remains a priority the fight against smoking, although the number of smokers is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of lung cancer cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also a risk factor for several other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," shaking his head spokesman Andr√© Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data : 10 years after a smoker stops smoking decreases the risk of cancer death by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Obesity and obesity are under SCC another risk factor for disease incidence.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">When excessive consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is advisable to avoid cold meats, for which the same applies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Preserving of meat smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer development," the report added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Recently, various researchers focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, studies have not yielded conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are contradictory by SCC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although one of them will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies prove rather increase it.</seg>
<seg id="49">Neither the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Beaulieu also stresses how important it is to talk about their fears and precedents of families with their doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Submit to the examination does not mean that you have cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgs boson explored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson sparked last summer authorized stir.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">A further is the last particle, whose existence is predicted standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Among the physics but still there is little hundred percent sure that this is the Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">No doubt about it, we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">New data released this week during the great physical Congress in Kyoto, it rather confirms, however, still lacking any data that we can be absolutely sure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Suppose, however, that it is the Higgs boson, since the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see, what is going on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world it is beyond question the law, according to which two things can occur at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule can not be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you hurt yourself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although particle physics very strange world, it turns out that it applies even similar laws : the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, particle physicists are divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On one side we find the good citizens, or fermions, which obediently comply with the Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end of the range bosons, depending anarchists who respect nothing at all - certainly did not this principle, which means that they can still be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (absolutely amazing by the way), which is The Particle Adventure, laboratories Berkeley : mesons, which are let go unnoticed, "force particles", which spreads a great natural forces with which the Higgs boson probably somehow related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Must say, however, that these bosons are not so exotic animals, as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you read this article, this is due to an unusual banality boson : the photon, or "particle of light", which is "awarded" the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when electrically charged particles accelerate or change direction, ' cancel ' the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "distraction" created an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "holders of power."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Also, it is the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that "disturb" should be another field, Higgs field to the boson discovered.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Higgs field is much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field, for its excitation is necessary to achieve very high energy values , like the frozen pond, already zƒçe≈ô√≠ a very large boulder.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part of the accelerator as an accelerator in CERN - Large hadron collider the colliding beam is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - In order to develop such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field, we again fit to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.</seg>
<seg id="25">The electromagnetic field does not respond or all particles or all materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, never by itself stick on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the same applies to the Higgs field particles do not respond to all : those who do, have a certain mass, while others (such as the photon, let's look at it) do not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A Mrs. Doe asks what all these studies are that "bring us?"</seg>
<seg id="29">From the point of view of science as a confirmation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to undergo examination of any discrepancy between observation and predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, quite a few physicists literally wishes, in order to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and to close some of the gaps in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to state that the model still has huge gaps, does not shed any light gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of matter in the universe (again, whoa).</seg>
<seg id="32">CERN facility but until now such discrepancies appeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Responses</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Responses of research in everyday life of Mr. and Mrs. Novak is very difficult to predict, it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Search for: at the very beginning of the 60th flight pioneers did not have laser at Bell Labs no idea of revolution, which causes their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Anticipated scientific use, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (last rays of the pulse) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially considered a "toy in the lab".</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And moreover, it may result from the use of any tools, which surround research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle made a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though not as Boyle initially planned, now serves as the "eye" of digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course this does not mean that the activities around the LHC will necessarily change your life, but it means that one never really knows...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative Care - The best way to leave the life of... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through its Commission for dignified dying Quebec recently joined the delicate questions concerning the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should continue soon and at the same time preparing the bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this crucial area remains to be done a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="5">The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Less than a few weeks, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Mont√©r√©gie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer that consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me five years of life, and it's seven," he said without emotion on his bed at home for palliative care Victor - Gadbois in Beloeil, where they arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it's still a shock to this you can not prepare," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has done its work: the enormous weakness prevents him take himself to the toilet or just to feed himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Resigned looking at delicious -looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is brave and even smiles and speaks with the unknown, who is at his stop, he brings drugs offer bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage to an ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, he humiliates me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later he found a team of doctors to cure his problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Throughout life, one learns that the guys standing urine," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor - Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">Return to this stage the child is unacceptable for some people to humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on the capabilities of a particular person," whether he shall return, says psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the number of persons engaged in palliative care are crucial moments take place in the core of such a return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who enter into a home with palliative care Victor - Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">The prognosis is more than three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, their team of doctors and nurses who care for them, does the so-called "medical" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die "to suffocation while conscious."</seg>
<seg id="24">Disease but allowed me to discover my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good kids," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In life we have no desire," he says, and then consents to put her breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet still enjoying in the coming days on the last visit of the son of Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The home of Victor - Gadbois in collaboration with a group of volunteers providing care for the body with nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">So it looks palliative care, which started when no longer do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">That death was convenient.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, the case of one bed palliative care to 11,700 people.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little, if we realize that everyone dies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life goes on in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When a person dies, he can provide such a sip of brandy or pepsi to taste.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics do not have to watch your blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">A death is a part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night, carrying beer to Mr. X, who later died in the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, finish your beer in honor of his son deceased father.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardov√°, director of nursing services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The home of Victor - Gadbois go one day at a time, but do not resemble each other.</seg>
<seg id="42">Besides t≈ôiadevades√°tilet√©ho man who rejoices in the last meeting with his family to thoroughly padded cushions while his toast in his honor, died tragically thirty-six man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after having tried all possibilities to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For half a year, there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer within 45 years," he says with concern, Dr. Christiane Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients in the home Victor - Gadbois come, come here from their homes, 47% of hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, ie care that is intended to alleviate the suffering, sick soon reach the final phase of his life, be it at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">A few organizations, such as the home of Victor - Gadbois and Society for the palliative treatment of the Grand Montr√©al, specialize more or less exclusively to the care provided to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that the number of physicians specializing in palliative care is concerned the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October, the circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatments such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec health care system is not powerful enough to ensure access of all people to quality palliative care before it can agree to carry out euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he said recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain, without anyone done the necessary steps to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="52">He fears that patients did not ask for death because they lack the appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, the number of oncologists caring for their patients until the last moments notwithstanding the unfavorable prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chances of survival H√©l√®ne Richard have been minimal, if left intensive chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my onkolo≈æce that I quit treatment, said he regrets that stop fighting, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">And they told me that it's over!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is omnipotent care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel is estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to their physicians for their desire not completed when their team palliative pussy alleviate pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But I must say that palliative care is definitely powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereauov√©, director of palliative care at the Society for palliative care in Grand Montr√©al, patients prevents pain in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life often doctors use palliative sedation that the patient sleeps until death, either abruptly or whether he sedatives administered continuously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I can not pretend that this part of the suffering perceive.</seg>
<seg id="63">Patients who get rid of pain, will still have more access to palliative sedative.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">That does not necessarily mean "I want you gave me Euthanasia" means rather "I want to get rid of my pain."</seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="13">So you use the competitive environment, which introduced Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every workout is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And that means that a player like me it has more flavor to the game and wants to give maximum performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">And I Carlo Ancelotti much giving in the context of my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">The hands have assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A Ancelotti has the last word at the right moment?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today has the first League peer and one of the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has vast experience with top teams and won a lot of titles.</seg>
<seg id="24">He also worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">For me to win more titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I attended with him comforting conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It had been a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trust, which provides me with is another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As you look at the first part of the season PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first We Lyon took the league lead.</seg>
<seg id="31">But remain in suspension.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is to Champions League: We very easily advanced to the final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is your club in this competition target?</seg>
<seg id="34">We try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we definitely want to be a good European teams tough opponent.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want to first win their qualifying group ahead of Porto in order to play in the replay osmifin√°le home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">PSG may happen in the short term major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">The budget has to be...</seg>
<seg id="40">Paris to become a major European club to win titles and make history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not already.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the financial side PSG has the means to carry out this plan succeeded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a big failure in the first nezv√≠tƒõzit league as last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year really want to win the league title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we still lacked enough.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed because we had to, to win.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had a great season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We collected 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Usually, with 79 points are clear champion...</seg>
<seg id="51">Yet another club, Montpellier, had season even more amazing.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think this year it will.</seg>
<seg id="53">Although the title of endeavor and big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think that we have the weapons to beat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think the media from PSG expecting too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect a lot from us due to what was invested and what our players.</seg>
<seg id="56">It totally accept.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and he's still find something to accuse us in the newspaper, so it's not exactly pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what the people you still might want more.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is not, of course, winning 4-0 every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We strive to set the style of play.</seg>
<seg id="62">To build a team you need time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League we have proved that we can play.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, who have already qualified for the second season round, while also invested a large amount!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the sums invested, one would expect that you will have over the other 15 points ahead!</seg>
<seg id="66">This insult other clubs and the French league.</seg>
<seg id="67">Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which last season was not very successful, with the new PSG moved to the next stage.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how the first League amazing.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as though PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is well, it is said that there is "dependence on Zlatan."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it gives a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Because he came here and shows that the star of the first League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever passed, proved to be a great player, a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our team we respect the person and player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He respects people around me that has.</seg>
<seg id="77">What they have achieved is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This has led others to the fact that increase their own level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows other parallel growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you live Euro 2012 with the French representation?</seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="82">I really wanted to play this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately due to injury, I could not play the way I imagined.</seg>
<seg id="84">But I experienced it and I came out of it stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I managed to play in the representation of good matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">And I was hoping since joining the national team.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe to ourselves, to our exemplary behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">As you look at the first month of Didier Deschamps led the national team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Results speak for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">In qualifying for the World Cup we are in a good place.</seg>
<seg id="91">Coach selects the top, players are nearby and able to inspire victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">Such was the Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has achieved its goals because we have qualified for Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the team to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Is a draw (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid starting the game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gave us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">We all fought for a team.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs for the recipient.</seg>
<seg id="3">As in these technologies often true, there is a feeling overt political outlook: The belief that the current financial system is built on banking monopoly leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Bitcoin, the inventor Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), as a virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euros...) and secure transfer protocol like BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between pairs of partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers in the network have been registered about 200,000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand websites already accepts Bitcoin as gifts or as payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bitcoin exchange rate peaked first$ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to$ 2, today borders on about ten dollars (list of courses is listed on the bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Compared with the world in exchange for real money or financial product that is nothing impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) interest on this fact in his report on the virtual finances, which was released in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin described as "the most successful virtual money", "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "period of normal cash."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin from other types of virtual money differs in that it is a "credit" for the procedure used in the video game, which one gets to play or you can buy (and sometimes even replace the back).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each month, but the central authority controls and processes each communication.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes Book Depository current accounts, auditors, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this system work?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses via e - mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">The user may select a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">File information related to this transaction is electronically signed an encryption system with double key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Due to the content of the file is also possible to ensure that replacement Bitcoin existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Key stage consists of writing this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">Performed by solving mathematical tasks assigned by computers whose leader, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the stage cut file, ie the transformation of a huge file to a shorter unique digital fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers "take over" this new transaction and add to the number, then the whole "hack".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find a number that provides specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then displayed indelibly linked to a string of other transactions; any modification altering the image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the user wanted for fraud, to pay the same money twice quickly in succession (within ten minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="29">A computer that will solve the challenge, winning 50 Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, share the reward periodically of two, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">Number of Bitcoin in circulation is so limited number 21000000, but you can divide up the stomili√≥ntinu, making room for margin here is...</seg>

<seg id="35">"Exploit a loophole is not the protocol itself," she says Pierre Noize, who founded Paymium, the company for the payment of real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">ECB also checks, money laundering due to the anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this problem also applies to cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players such as Wikipedia refuse gifts that nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like the WordPress blogging platform is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book and current accounts showed that almost 80% of Bitcoin does not circulate.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November launched a "huge discounts".</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was replaced thirty thousand U.S. dollars," says a delighted Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaged in converting Bitcoin to Gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noize, who is also the author of books on the teaching of the money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">The system Paytunia is equivalent to a credit card (real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system for verification of transactions, which are thus cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, the wearer manages its identity and can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easily adjusted at merchants where it is not necessary to install the new terminals or the like.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just tell the address that the phone can be "photocopied and recognize," explains Pierre Noize, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems.</seg>

<seg id="11">It is a very short period of time, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the plan text Egyptians clarify the article after article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the country convulsed protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview with Time magazine, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people against the ultimatum : "Either approve my text, or have unlimited powers" that would otherwise have the approval of the new constitution to end.</seg>

<seg id="25">Salafist party for which the introduction of Islamic law, one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term "principles" by "rules" which would allow stricter enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For Islamists again that this article has not been corrected, a sign of their good will and respect to the other parts of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy", argue liberals, who see it as a rhetorical problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to it, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They focus in particular Article 220, which confers the University of al - Azhar advisory role, especially for issues of control of conformity of laws with sharia law.</seg>

<seg id="34">With this constitution remains Egypt generally civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who worked on this text, not chip away, but academics, many of them studied in French schools, " moderate concern Alexis Blouet, which prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">But agree that " there may be discrepancies regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because there are terms used in religious terminology.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is particular reference to the "fiqh" [ Islamic jurisprudence, ed. ed. ].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may appear question, to what extent are civil judges competent to be able to express. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday approved text, in addition to religious sites highly criticized because of enhanced powers granted to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction compared to the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another controversial point: the powers entrusted to the military.</seg>

<seg id="43">Furthermore, not in military courts prohibited the management of civilians, as demanded by the association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">This association is discussed in relation to the text which they say is aimed against freedom of its concerns.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and continues to insult the disabled, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, especially for printing.</seg>
<seg id="46">No article does not deal with the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayefov√° of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point of the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36</seg>

<seg id="1">"Great and Mighty" to notify to Moscow : emigrants to save money on language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While parliamentarians and human rights defenders still debating the law on compulsory language tests in the country have already discovered scammers who are selling "fake" certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities arrives annually 13 million foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On 1 December, the Act, which stipulates that anyone migrant workers must pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yet this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail.</seg>
<seg id="8">FMS also promises that by the time the tests are mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The tests, however, will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will also be confirming to the acquisition and renewal of work permits.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Act was not subject to the people who have successfully achieved certification and obtain an academic degree in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Benefit and protection of the rights condemnation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Network test sites will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, University friendship between nations, Moscow State University, State University of ST. St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants can take the tests in all the cities, it is already in Russia opened more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Initiatives to support the implementation of testing supported by deputies of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask many times in the press question and what it actually bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the actual visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all - meet representatives of the migration service - allows to reduce the number of people who suffer from "slave labor."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Chairman FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">Protecting their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of organized recruitment to 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems arise for immigrants without occupation, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without knowing the language - he says with conviction Sebelev - the future migrant sentenced to clashes with rogue people who help him on the pretext of ensuring "voucher" in terrible, tight hostels, in which he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents and toil for 12-14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our migrant workers receive many complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In their homeland they promise one, but after the arrival deceive, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages," says Chief of Tajik labor migration management MS Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Complain!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to get, but do not experience even with the job.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course it is not so much their fault as much as the disaster : very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, put on a recall to school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children grow into productive age must be the first opportunity to go to work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without knowledge of the language is difficult - admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and miserable."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that with regard to the law on language tests highlight human rights defenders on one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be performed only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have it, so there will be no exams or receive any official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers live as before in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or No entry for unauthorized"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the immigrant workers argue that to gain official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all these language problems.</seg>
<seg id="41">Legalization addition, costs money : 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Employees of the Russian police know that we are basically false documents without registration, and the resulting extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They need a hundred to two cigarettes, tea," - shared with reporters about their experiences citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chu≈°kadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, do not be stingy, buy a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the law on language found that are not only false papers for registration of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="47">Employees FMS already seized several fake certificates of completion of exams.</seg>
<seg id="48">Counterfeit documents are printed on plain color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners did not get for free: each of migrants in the hope that it will facilitate problem with passing tests paid for this document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times higher amount than the official completion of the test: it will become migrant workers three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task of the immediate future is so secure your system against corruption, the workers could not simply buy papers, of which coincide with government officials and human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id="52">Government authorities can not promise foreign workers, who have not mastered the test the first time, it takes time for it to undergo a basic course in Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="53">For visitors who can not Russian, is expected to work in areas which do not require active dealing with people.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">MVD Russia is proposing a tightening of the law in relation to civilian firearms owners.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the response of government authorities at recent events : stimulus cases were shooting at weddings, which went without victims, and ready to massacre Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, the result of which killed seven people.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem through "tightening the screws".</seg>
<seg id="8">In the network appeared an open letter, the authors - representatives of various social organizations of shooting - require rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, in an interview with the BBC Russian.</seg>

<seg id="10">According to statistics of the Ministry of Interior was for six months in 2012 committed 142 crimes using firearms registered authorities of the Ministry of Interior, while for the same period a total of 1,168 were committed thousands of crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are convinced tightening legislation on civilian weapons do not cause the offender to join the "black" market.</seg>
<seg id="12">In their words can currently be found in Moscow any weapon at a low price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Currently, the Interior Ministry said the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers : from racing after officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"Black" arms market is supplied by several channels.</seg>
<seg id="16">The main channel is five, says retired Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years in the offices of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot sites that accept orders weapons</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first - "Army or the military way", that is a gun that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Guns stolen and Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," says Baranec.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another type of "black guns" weapons are stolen by criminals representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that this includes stealing from police stores and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal "mainly" to get into the sale of military depots.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military warehouses often leads to outbursts.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There is evidence that some fires were started deliberately - in order to conceal shortages," says a former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">His contribution brings the words of Barance and arms manufacturers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Currently arise private armament firms that are not competitive on the international market, and decommission weapons that give the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of "black" market smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is the manufacture, sometimes there weapons produced in small-scale production, and was the Mafia, who organized their continuous production," says a former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where 's the gun?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The experts added up, what is the approximate proportion of individual sources of illegal weapons in the "black" market.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists dismantled statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminological literature data and public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, comes from the military and executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons ended up on the black market "due to officers whose work involves weapons," says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts in 14% of cases of stolen weapons in their production, 5% is "black archeology".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Vendor- consultant of one of the arms trade, which asked us to mention his name, he is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations black "archeologists" a long time ago nobody buys - they are simply too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most often, he says, the seller goes for new shipments directly to military depots.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite Ensign a candidate buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.</seg>
<seg id="40">In order him a gun and he'll sell it over the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"That drive it into the city, and you sell it for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," she says.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">In the U.S. striking workers supermarkets and fast-food</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Work at the cash register of establishments "McDonald" goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages of Walmart supermarkets and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave transforms into the ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">All the support departments that share a number of leftist social organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to a modest increase in salaries they receive ordinary workers at Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of the organizers of the protests achieve them create their unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when America struck orgy cheap sale, gripped millions of citizens and, in some cases accompanied by a brawl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some workers by Walmart, in which the world operates on the 2.2 million people left their work and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals retail chains, which are intended for people from the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells worldwide everything from diapers through hunting rifles and automotive batteries to the cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in the stores are an average of 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, many low-wage workers in Walmart stores purchases only in my work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Availability of a range of products made from chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of critics Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply partly because few pay their employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about the bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic or manual wheelchairs scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded salary increase and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by increased sharply from 30 to 100 U.S. dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Walmart worker gets$ 9.5 per hour, it does not correspond to a height of expenditure, employees say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase the average wage to$ 12 an hour, it will cost the company$ 3.2 billion annually.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is on average 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company moves Walmart wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store cost only about 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as customers spend about$ 12.39 more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Advocates of Walmart pointed out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" in stores company lasted from 8 pm Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this period, Walmart sold around 5,000 product items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, the Treasury implemented the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that jobs have left the whole "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all in all "other media sensation", organized by the trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Unattended cash register!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was not Walmart stores (those in the progressive city that are not too fond of, and therefore there is almost none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says that sells billions of servings, and then you either paid sick leave and do not pay you well for your hard work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations in the State of New York$ 7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast-food restaurant that wages gradually increase, but only slightly, and on average receive their rank and file workers in New York$ 8.90 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city nobody has a lower wage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well enough to understand how you can be in New York for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employing the "McDonald" is going through nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people sees this as their main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Currently constantly encounter in an interview with the staff of "McDonald's", who complain that they have to live off the money and some of them even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum hangs comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you feed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 am Thursday at the "McDonald's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cook at a fast food enterprises began to receive at least$ 15 per hour, which is more than double the current minimum wages.</seg>
<seg id="40">It also demanded that in the realm of fast food were based trade organization.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. law prohibits the administration hinder the creation of trade unions and trade union activists to punish harassment and dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand their management rarely makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">Establish fast food companies trade unions is also difficult for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is extremely high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">disagreement</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In this day held noisy protests in a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The climax of the event was noon rally at the "McDonald's" near Times Square, where he performed several local Democratic politicians, particularly members of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said : "McDonald" says sells billions of servings, and then you either paid sick leave and not you properly for your hard work! "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Demonstrators will finally support as well as other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to speak in support of fast-food workers so as to achieve a fair remuneration for their work and the economic prosperity it deserves every New Yorker!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food sector.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended by a few hundred people, although not all of them were employees of fast food in New York to employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"We are doing brain deceive average"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Among fans of modern technologies of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality, in recent years it means to perceive the world through the prism particularly special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of summer at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a working model of the news and in November it was announced that the relevant patent application filed by Microsoft as well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In an interview with the head of a group of interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft's Cambridge lab Sarama Izadim that the scientists of this company are glasses of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">Attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please tell us generally what does your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are human interaction with machines, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Humanity still stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touching the screen with your finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensor - it is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without the Kinect sensor, because for all the very interesting possibility to control with gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What else does the future hold?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that the system Kinect transferred to the physical level of interaction, a lot of interaction still takes place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">Input information flow is improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the outlet flow is still not particularly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We're trying to change, we work to truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies including projective.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more realistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we can add to the real world of virtual objects in much better form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a popular thing, but not revaluated with?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Surely it can not be considered a panacea - the question of privacy, they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood about their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, any type of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gesture, but not the sweeping, only those skoup√Ωch, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gesta Yet it would not pick up a camera device, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is a large, but theoretically it can reduce the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as voice + gesture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How so?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- How to ask me for example, I give you this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say it and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually just simply talking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So you want to force the user to adapt to what at any given moment may or may not machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- That's not necessary, but it is mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can accurately detect human reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It can be as laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for a modern camera?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is now sufficient resolution, depth, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In fact, the current generation - that is, from what may be reflected in our work on three-dimensional pattern recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s</seg>
<seg id="40">But it's not just about megapixels alone, but as nuts and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">At the current point of view, all the current technology that we lack - that more work designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in X and Y, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">So very important is the speed, number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movement is quite dynamic and simultaneous data streams 30 frames per second, frankly, are a little low, especially for the gesture.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing in length from 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands what extent it affects the human-machine interaction.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me it would be very useful work equivalent to such a device, just do not need as much contact, but need some extra frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- A increasing number of cameras is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- On Kinect are now used three "camera", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second - the reflected signal receiver.</seg>
<seg id="50">A third camera - it is actually a common sensor visible band.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">The larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or it worse, because it would increase the required volume of the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play the curvature of the placement of the cameras and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) presented himself publicly their glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do not you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course a walk while constantly keeping smatphone in upraised hand is not very comfortable, but I think : the most powerful variant would be "portable" form of augmented reality, which could be based on platforms clouds switch from glasses ever smartphone, projection screen and around.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (private stuff yourself only), and at the same weakness - Augmented Reality based glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available only Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem that critics often point : there is no touch response!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands do not feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group prepares for the challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the addition of tactile sensations could well happen eighth breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, use one of the interesting tricks - use second-hand as a kind of substrate for imaging.</seg>
<seg id="66">An excellent way compression records!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibility these "images in the air" - such as interference few directional ultrasound beam at a defined point where the finger, raised tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also a bracelet on his wrist that affects the nerve endings in your fingers - a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think, to feel what it seems, that he should feel at the moment when they see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- It is a good idea, we never tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here, there's yet another challenge that will fight long - how to get a man who is physically located in a very confined space, to believe that he was walking in an open, practically infinite space - are also working on the concept of trails (no not those a club), moving platforms, and huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If deception brain becomes a target, so it works even for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes working on virtual reality and attractive for researchers - many things are in a sheer beginning.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "St. Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated citizens who are at the forefront, the vanguard of culture and art.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list has been an important figure in St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often found recognition in Europe without reaching the All-Russian fame.</seg>
<seg id="4">New hero "Rosbaltu" is a stunning artist Cyril Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum in the summer garden, in the trendy pubs and openings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Paintings Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the crowds.</seg>

<seg id="8">Cyril Miller - a prominent man Petersburg avant-garde end of the 80th and early 90 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, the city of man, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of citizens increases all spirits.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently picked up the hurdy-gurdy and became the Petrograd organist, because in this difficult role is ripe for his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Cyril, so why do you go around the city all in red and not yellow or turquoise for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose the color red as a designer concerned with appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world there is a red compromise between the artist and the public Imagemaker.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although the general rule is that everything is just a little different from the gray, wake aggression and waking up bad qualities.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocation aimed at that interview was established.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">- And when did you realize that you have to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- The exhibition at the House of Culture on Nevsky, where they were exposed to my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understand what is the way to go.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then went the old liberal wave of unofficial artists and a new, free types of artists I could not understand.</seg>
<seg id="21">I became friends with artists new wave of post - gazonƒõvsk√Ωmi who brought us the "Pu≈°kinsk√© 10", and other waves have been.</seg>
<seg id="22">Attracted me to the theater, dressing, music, all genres except in words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- And it's all come together to form your art- clinic... - For me it was important to find himself in the center of culture Petersburg, where should gather all the best powers of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I took place on 10 Pu≈°kinsk√©, and there still existed before reconstruction musical art club, bohemian club, home petƒõrburksk√© bohemians.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are many born : NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget to bring cord with the project "Van Gogh's Ear."</seg>
<seg id="26">Lacing his friends sang the plywood light songs, dressed in a tight leotards, in the middle between composer Igor Vdovin, which is now in vogue.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the band started playing live, became the "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg has led many programs hali - galivsk√Ωch times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtenberg, thus began his great career, basic education and training received by us.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I'm the hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000, a survey was held in the press, a special prize was "People in our city."</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed I ended by my top.</seg>
<seg id="35">In new times under the old rules work is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things you can be popular, but not very cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works are characterized by a recognizable manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which vividly captured the timeliness and discernment.</seg>
<seg id="39">I have programmed the exhibition "Russian Museum in the Clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless categories.</seg>
<seg id="41">Before, I used to be sociable, today be such a painful and horrible.</seg>
<seg id="42">But clowns are all blurred, captures the tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love slapstick tend to have grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, to save the world through a totalitarian disguise in a prescriptive order.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today, people are confronted by clothing, focusing on the external drive, not the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or maybe he can not shake hands and be spit in his face.</seg>
<seg id="47">A delusion is removed cross-dressing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- We recently saw you in the role of municipal organ grinder. - Cultural city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">And who would it be, if not me?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- A commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- Currently should be commercially useful arts thorough, tactful, sweet.</seg>

<seg id="60">A cultural land comes to 300 people and 10,000 of them will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything fades.</seg>

<seg id="12">Already half a century ago we carried out experiments on plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their terrestrial relatives.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was then carried to orbit delivery of insects - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 was sent into space quail eggs to verify how the embryo develops in a state of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">At the output we get absolutely normal bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find a foothold, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syƒçev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If you do not find a foothold, birds fall erratically and doing somersaults.</seg>
<seg id="20">After 10 hours there was a freshly hatched birds to utter extinction instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Birds did not react to light or sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">A difficulty was that within four days just died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Twice we had hatched birds, but we refused because it is simply impossible for there to work with them," says failure experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syƒçev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last "miniarcha" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In spring 2013, the experiments continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">In biosatelitu "Bion" but are only being one sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Experiment was conducted with rats, which were broadcast into space already pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there is nothing supernatural discovered.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It was just biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be made," says Vladimir Syƒçev.</seg>

<seg id="36">For ethical reasons, similar experiments performed.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest danger was Tƒõre≈°kovov√©.</seg>
<seg id="39">Most precious thing that humanity has a woman's body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our seagull flew and no one on earth could not say whether withstand space flight.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether after such a flight can give birth to a child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"But the question still no answer," says veteran rocket - space industry Vakhtang Vaƒçnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, more than a year after space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova - daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The child's father was also a cosmonaut Nikolayev ANDRIJANA.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988 was born the son of another woman - kosmonautce Svetlana teat, which visited orbit twice and that worked well in open space.</seg>
<seg id="46">The risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We only have a few astronauts who, after long years born and grow healthy offspring.</seg>
<seg id="48">"In addition, it can be dangerous even when the orbital period," the pilot - cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Humanity still has inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Hydrolaborato≈ô CPK is an obligatory step in preparation for flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in conditions of zero gravity the astronauts acquire the skills needed to work in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water simulates weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Although adult water is even comfortable, but in a way, a strange environment for young children is a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ichtiand≈ôi seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between the fact that the child is an average of nine months in the mother's amniotic fluid and it is then easier for them to get used to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, it is logical, since the moment of birth, from the moment that first swim, pass only two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It is very little that the child forgot something," says instructor baby swimming Marina Aksenovov√°.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short - if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness natural state, it is natural for women inevitable gravitation, the attractive force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In a state of weightlessness occurs very rapidly to decline abdominal muscles, pelvis, decreasing the body's ability to expel the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">This can be set aside if they work stimulators muscle activity during childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the mother's body expels the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And what else?" puts Valeri Polyakov complex issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Unless the organism causing gravity, can not properly form the skeleton system or muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">Newborn orbit can not dress like an adult in a special suit with stress, in which he could train.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just be deprived of what is essential to their development needs.</seg>
<seg id="67">"If you go into the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, bring to Earth a disabled person who is utterly unsuited to the local environment," predicts head of the committee on bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So births in the universe today is just a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">But one day the time will come when it becomes a reality when the earthlings issue in their Korab on a far planet, which will be home to their descendants born in the universe.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Chief SAO : Check Svarc system failed due to political</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Czech is in respect of public good supervisors and good law, but lags in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Aktu√°lne.cz it says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct its applications - this is what our missing in my opinion," says the current situation Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar findings also suggest joint control of Czech and German reviewers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practice Petr Necas gives access to the so-called "Svarc system".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother his business controls - it is banned or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be some setting after all, and if something is forbidden, so why is not the Prime Minister can not prevent the operation of the Authority, which has a duty to go check and enforce the obligations," says Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies are talking about a joint project between the Czech and the German party under which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What specifically was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control, we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Basically the point is that European legislation regulates how public procurement deal, followed by the various national legislations and also the actual practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We put all this together, even if control is not yet complete, we have shown interesting differences - generally speaking, our legislation is not "stronger and better", but the practice itself is in some parameters improved in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms that it is not enough to create ever on and on precise rules, but you need to pay the actual application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What will this project can actually help you out of it for you then?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is such a common control could help to make an effort to stop the refinement laws, reduction and refinement limits when it has such a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Efficiency means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but this is not always the lowest) price in order to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by lowering the limit orders, which do not necessarily meet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maybe the system is overwhelmed by so many "paper" that those who are in the system they want to look for holes and those of which will draw much more easily than if they remained higher limit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You're talking about domestic issues in translating legislation on public procurement into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is similar to our office SAO, or is it set differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities concerned, as there SAO works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, a form slightly different way, but basically both authorities proceed accordingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal structure and has the following audit offices and the L√§nder - in that the system is a little different from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can only control the federal money, here represented by state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are managed in our regions and municipalities, there is control at the level of the federal courts of auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As far as local legislation, so that it is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally I would not hate comparing specific data, but in some ways, Germany is known as a model, but you can definitely say that it is better at everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is therefore necessary and that have better controllers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it must be said that even countries that consider the pattern is facing a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not offer any benefit to cooperate with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With regard to domestic legislation, what your office meant the amendment of the Act on Public Procurement has somehow manifested its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the duration of this amendment is relatively short, so for us yet in control events does not occur.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we control ex post, it is necessary to count with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We see it not only in the preparation of future inspections - We have started our new tool "detection risk mismanagement", through which we ran the almost 14,000 contracts, and we analyzed them - there are of course those changes will manifest as a change limits, conditions some type of competition is adjusted and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The approval of this Act therefore considered more benefits or more bureaucratic system load?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think this law is definitely step in the right direction, and I hope to confirm this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">A problem that may arise here that she rules "tighten up" and can not be observed.</seg>
<seg id="40">Have previous rules for the functioning of the controlled person committed to the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programs, regional council) that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act is a violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It therefore cost the law in this way tighten?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal error which has no impact on decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And both of which thus out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us show you which way is not the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneur controls the so-called "Svarc system" - what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">≈†varcsyst√©m is disabled or enabled?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be some setting after all, and if something is forbidden, so why is not the Prime Minister can not prevent the operation of the Authority, which has a duty to go check and enforce the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say : "We will change the law and allow it", but can not say that we do not like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public procurement are rather strict rules about how you should be formally done - which is properly to protect public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best bidder is disqualified only for formal deficiencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct its applications - this is what the us, in my opinion, is missing.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It's just another alarmist which we humans love to catch them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with his band The Tap Tap a makes it more fun, and we say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the end of the world to delay or prevent it.</seg>

<seg id="23">We try to intensively involved in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them working with us interested and entertained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What proceeds from the concert will go to the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Barrier-free facilities at the educational center STUDEO that you realize sixth year with the civic association Tap in an institution.</seg>
<seg id="27">For students Jedlicka Institute regularly attend lecturers and engaged them in activities that are fun and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the means to set out for teachers themselves, we strive to enable them thus in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">The completion Jedlicka Institute in future there will be a separate building in which to move on with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert will be several musical groups and artists.</seg>
<seg id="31">Based on what you selected them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to compile a program that will appeal to all ages, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Jiri Suchy.</seg>
<seg id="34">All details can be found on www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are you planning any similar "bombastic action" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we will first perform at the Prague Spring Festival, so i will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year we would also like to play in the Czech National Hall in New York, and I personally, when you are in USA, I would like to affiliated with performances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you have already performed such as Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">How you handle these routes logistically and organizationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as bad as it first seems.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members on an electric wheelchair, its trucks must travel in the cargo area, as well as, obviously vl√°ƒç√≠me large amounts of cargo and boxes with tools...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far it has always been managed without any problems, CSA and British Airways to us were well prepared that I have to wonder how many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks v√Ωjezd≈Øm abroad can compare how each differs in wheelchair accessibility, public access to the handicapped and the like.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have not met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Russia that the East is all still in the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="48">Unlike Prague, Moscow is a barrier, there is still unusual for a person to an electric wheelchair could move downtown.</seg>
<seg id="49">Not there either so commonplace as to be wheelchair users prefer the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there also arise civic association that seeks to problems of people with disabilities alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And what on the other hand we still have to catch up with developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many things in which we are still behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to note that the improvement and enhancement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is quite common that even people with severe disabilities to move independently of the public can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not very usual that there would be large numbers of people with disabilities actively participated in social life, in that we are contrary to The Tap Tap a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public and wheelchair accessibility is one thing but once in a while, when one of us will be prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, and things really begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">There are rare cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years back what you made in 1998 to establish her?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I started as a tutor to Jedlicka Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to pursue.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am myself a musician, playing the saxophone, among other things, so I founded along with fellow hobby musical ring.</seg>
<seg id="61">And over time, we, as our moderator says Lada Angeloviƒç, a little out of hand (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity but came up in recent years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us when we started to connect with famous singers and actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">We figured that the work is not seen as basically would not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, moreover we can afford quality instructors, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Was your goal to make it to The Tap Tap this high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt the potential that they can do something else.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness is chock full of things where one imitates the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">It's kind of logic, new everything is taken care and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">Things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of someone who sees us for the first time, of course, regret, it is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity is totally useless because people with disabilities are no abandoned all suffering beings, which we regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming of course that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if something can people with disabilities, so it is not just a shift for them, but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">This success helped also that you have a strict boss, how many people have you said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">When we do good work, we must be uncompromising in many cases require a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it is perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion as head in the clouds, and when they find that they have two weeks to rehearse, attend and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, so is enthusiasm quickly leaves.</seg>
<seg id="79">But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently the band The Tap Tap twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç.</seg>
<seg id="83">We're a group of people come and go, it can not be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and desire, we always have an open door</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21 hours</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Held in Prague Incheba arena, Fleda Brno and Ostrava gasholder participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">All three cities are at the end of the evening teleconference link in the joint singing songs the band The Tap Tap "End of the World canceled"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is to collect funds to equip the multi -barrier educational center STUDEO at Jedlicka Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week was the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency adopted for Poland twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as the second country of the former Eastern bloc countries (the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years participated in a number of projects agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the journey to Poland cosmos began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Flight into space is devoted to Polish fans before the Second World War, but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Think, for example A. Sternfeld lecture in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which 6th December 1933 represented the ideas of his groundbreaking work Access to Space.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ideas young engineer (b. 1905) let the audience cold and after years Sternfeld recalled that only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sternfeld in 1934 won for Access to Space in France the price of Robert Esnault - Pelterieho Andr√© and Louis Hirsch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Remembering Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and has written a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became world famous promoter of Astronautics and his contribution was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 in Poland was built rail trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and there is no project details.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear whether the missile should be used to start or trolleys to contain it.</seg>
<seg id="15">About this trolley are known only from the press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933, the rocket projectiles began to entertain the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research provided closet Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfkem and prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">The surviving material is evident that research has reached a stage prakzick√Ωch tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the arrival of German troops research was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 he appeared in professional journals proposal photoelectric fighter missiles, designed by engineer Rohozi≈Ñski and the following year published work launchers - torpedo powietrzna and rakietobomba Lotnicza author Leliwy - Krzywoblock√©ho.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all projects use military rocketry devoted Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradcza - Naukowe), which coordinated all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years the activities of its activity ended the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other works devoted to aerospace after the war in the Polish press appear thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">First is the mention of the company in the November issue of the journal Year 1954 problems, which are four comprehensive articles on astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicze is proposed to establish a company that will deal with the series.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, radiating projects artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is a promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) seek to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded 1951) and in the autumn the PTA became a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">He held this post until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 the PTA contributed significantly to the development of the highly successful RM meteorological rockets (rockets Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which has conducted scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM -1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on 10 ≈ô√≠jna 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rocket with ceiling was 1,800 m long, about 80 cm and its weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was later built an enhanced version RM - 1A and summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovsk√© two-stage missile flight test RM - second</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another type of development you should be able to real science - rocket RM -34 should have ceilings up to 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the winds aloft.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962 the other on hold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor to the first missiles RM has become a racket Meteor -1 developed from 1962 to 1965th</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a two, its total length was 510 cm and a starting weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">They were developed three types (denoted Meteor - 1A - 1B -1C), which differed in the size of the area for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor missile -1A was space available on 0.4 liter, Meteor - 1B by volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor - 1C with a capacity of 0.62 liters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum ceiling for all three types was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 took place in the Aviation Institute of rocket development Meteor -2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket Meteor -2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently built version of Meteor and Meteor - 2H - third</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is also necessary to mention Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also in the Intercosmos program participated in the research space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Repeal of the Act on public works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">Resolution led to a lively public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberal -oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalized world are based on multiple, unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In its effect, this means that the individual economic formations national economic systems, is in permanent conflict between them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The reason is the principle of free trade and free, unfettered movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the considerable differences in labor cost (wages) is to price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation, where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods meet competition by "trips" cost competitor to pull down on a greater share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a mass scale, it is for most entrepreneurs either translate into production abroad or there cheaply buy or zaniknout.V√Ωsledkem is high unemployment in countries where the cost of labor in comparison with other economies high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for it and produced by unemployment, rising social expenditures necessarily state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation is enhanced by the sheer unwillingness of Lords entrepreneurs pay taxes and to replace the economic and social damage that society as a whole in the pursuit of profit has done.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to indicate the specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unscrupulous practices of private capital in the form of economies situation where governments are forced to enter into competition with one another in order to artificially reduce the welfare of their own people in order to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments give private capital risking their own population, regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected mainly in changes in applicable laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is economically forcing its own people received dictate the price of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This happens first set of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by limiting the rights of employees in employment law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is growing poverty, along with the increasing differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany there are many years of public dispensaries food for the poor, who can not support their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">Number of people go into the millions already.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is quite common to cases that properly employed people receive a wage that they must pay the price to become subsistence.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was made public in the case of auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Austerity virtually all southern States will undoubtedly lead to the same state when people are under pressure catastrophic decline in social standards either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or eke out a living for starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that the country will come perhaps once private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is necessary, however, but might wonder where it comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it is from other EU countries, the poverty moves from one country to another, or not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian or Turkish, Moroccan or Egyptian, African, or still work for a fraction of the wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and media ad nauseam argues that the state can not participate in private capital economy, that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private equity stubbornly to insist that the state should not interfere with management interventions into the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">You then need to ask whether private capital does not affect, now actually control policy and the entire state of self- egoistic sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is the definitive answer that yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof of the existence of virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation manifested in corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislature, where almost all reprehensible, but not criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds outsource the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are frequently in conjunction with industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power thus does not come from the people how to advocate Western-style constitution, but the financially powerful groups prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the liberal- oriented democracy now quickly get into a situation as described by Appian in his book Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey : "The state has long been in the full decomposition and authorities manned violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal obtaining favors and using stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption thrived without any inhibitions and people went to the polls with a pre- sold voice "..." decent people will not run for office at all, so once was a result of the breakdown of the state was eight months without consuls "...." It started with really talk about it, that the only remedy in bad situation autocracy and the need for a vigorous man.. " Appian Although thought of Pompey, but it became Caesar, who turned into lasting democracy to autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Conclusion As in the ancient world, the current company based on the preference of reckless self-interest, regardless of societal interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is already inherently able to understand and apply the societal benefit.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now the same as if unexampled elite decadence without any attempt at reform goes deeper.</seg>
<seg id="43">Causality onset of fascist and communist regimes must therefore seek the indiscriminate liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20 century.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current state of these systems can demise in favor of liberal democracy type considered as a break with the expectations next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Particularly devastating is the fact that the current elite completely ignored in the future to hundreds of thousands of casualties, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we now witness along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">Repeal of the Act on public works is not an option, at least not permanently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition, both at international and European level, the Interior of the Czech Government forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the welfare of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore a system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, will strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of the private capital of the State.</seg>

<seg id="8">Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts are some of them derived based on my own understanding of who respectively. What group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In each epoch, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so obvious is if it were always those individuals who autonomously guided their actions and or whether their throne stood someone who directed the actions of the pre- defined goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and resulting power will not occur in the lifetime of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among the astronomically wealthy families juts one that could be considered a squid head (if there is someone above them do not know, but do not rule it) - Rothschieldov√©.</seg>
<seg id="14">I really do not write about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>

<seg id="17">They have major stakes in almost all central banks of the world and against the countries where the share of the central bank not to lead or preparing wars (Afghanistan against attacks were 7 countries after invading Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi was reduced to four, but in the meantime Russia subordinate to the Central bank of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who tried to defy the family, died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank Rothschieldovƒõ Bank of America began during the Civil War to issue its own (read: government) money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began issuing its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after the Fed wanted to sue for starting the Great Depression in 1929.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate plans three world wars Mason High, 33 levels of initiation Albert Pike.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was tasked to remove a monarchical government units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial domination in particular the United Kingdom and the third has lead to the reduction of world population somewhere in the 0.5 - 1 billion people (as many slaves for their comfort and luxury and do not consume enough many sources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than foreground for such a solution), and the final takeover of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method the group 's wealthiest families headed by Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed to repeat crisis like the one that sparked in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">So, after they managed assassination of the Habsburg heir to the throne RU Ferdinand in Sarajevo unleash the First World War, destroyed the Tsarist Russia starting the Bolshevik Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unfounded, the capitulation of Germany (there was no need for war, destruction of Czarist Russia) and was subsequently fragmented Central Powers, Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">For ease of unleashing the Second World War left the bankers policies create latent conflict situation by the fact that Germany had imposed huge war reparations, which created a presumption of radicalization impoverished masses and then they had to do was slip the Germans sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions vendor and leader creating a multinational Czechoslovakia strong German minority that should play, and I played, the fifth column, the ignition of the fire of war.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like war reparations Germany was off to WW2, was the announcement of the state of Israel created the third outbreak of war.</seg>

<seg id="3">Should be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the U.S., the patron of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Situation for the U.S. administration did not offer a positive basis - throw overboard the Shah could not afford it, because it would fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">Release of the hostages but in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, were unable to reach.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, later deepened fiasco attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Imprisonment diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">They do at home sparked a wave of solidarity and proti√≠r√°nsk√©ho sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the presidential election of 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Film re≈æ√≠ruj√≠c√≠ho actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that America has brought small victories.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before the occupation of the embassy staff fled six.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a complicated end up at the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to get them out of Iran, helped yet extravagant cover story - went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country surveyed locations for filming sci - fi epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combining genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez, required cooperation and Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To legend was credible, wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, held a press conference fictitious production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, also called "caper movie," the story vyda≈ôen√©ho bit, Sting - example might be a series of Ocean's Eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, so alternating moods - on the one hand, the documentary conceived sequence of Tehran (in credits of the period are shown iconic photographs of events and the way in which the same situation is demonstrated in the film - big differences in how not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, lighter passages from Hollywood, papers ironically a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in hallways office phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck is remarkably managed to restart career.</seg>
<seg id="24">For ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, the dark crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">It is also the first film Affleck, who does not take place in the director's home Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">Feel for the atmosphere of the place yet was one of the characteristics that the director's earlier films haughty above the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">A Affleck him reflected in Argos, where Tehran "plays" in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scene in the movie takes place in the streets, in reconstructing the actual event - the fall of the embassy opening sequence is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotion and confusion nep≈ôev√≠datelnosti that arise when someone suddenly move history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are making in fictional scenes (fake crew on Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many processes in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that narrated the story really does not offer much in terms of exciting movie scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successful with it almost works, sometimes a little p≈ôimysl√≠ to reality - where it all comes out so gracefully (the scene in which the looming crisis in Tehran airport turn call in America and chase down the runway has pretty far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Argo is a weakness but restlessness arising from the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in roles Hollywood collaborators indeed very charming and their characters but would deserve more space and not in the film is far from the only one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleck film loses a bit of dramatic tension, it is the image jej≈æ can watch with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation and retro style evocative thrillers 70th years.</seg>
<seg id="37">Grabbing but hardly.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder yet somehow living history and evidence of how overblown the concept of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services but will suffice.</seg>

<seg id="1">People want to saving the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Senator, as a man think that he wants to run for president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is not my intention to be a senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If it worked in our country without any problems, so do not run anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can not watch the last twenty years the country stolen, the thieves as they run, people are increasing taxes and retirement ages.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambition to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something I like, so I try to come up with a solution how to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I was already forty and I am an independent non-party, I have no way to influence things than to run for senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate you're getting, but soon you went to the Castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Do not turn it back to the people who elected you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The whole time I was saying that the fight goes to the castle result in the Senate election.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I explained that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal but not function, the tool is, how can I make my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not only that as a nation swear in the pub and television, but they trample anyone who wants to try to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To do this, add media that dehonestuj√≠ a man who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">About to be claimed that upl√°c√≠m journalist or that I was an adviser to Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's go to your vision.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fight for the Castle have started with the thesis material and criminal responsibility of politicians and return of equity returns over twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To do this, you must change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president, but you do not have such authority and the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you solve it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I was a citizen lobbied for that guiding was free trade, managed to push through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good design from the left or from the right, on purpose to refuse to citizens and resident.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent non-party have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My preference is that no party label and dogmas can I take what is best for our country, on each side, and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you consider yourself more of a man of right-wing or left-wing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view it seems to me, that my people are going more to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it is not important if a little left or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me it is important for us to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always publicly support it any good solution, although it suggests Communist Party or ODS, and so am against bad idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">ƒåert√≠te when someone says about you, that you are populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But it does not prove what you say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create byznyspl√°n in the company, and also have a perfect aim and vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">And we try to approach it.</seg>
<seg id="37">Some may call it populism, but all suggestions, I'm talking about you in the world of work, or talking about them prominent experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament you're left with just your password.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that a long time in politics not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them that you can impose such criminal and material responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Persuading politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on your side to enforce it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I were elected president, there is no problem to hold televised live broadcast, which will ask the chairman of the parliamentary parties to enact substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they would possibly have to tell her why they do not want.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the strong personality that will name the ills can push the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president, it was thanks to public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Frankly I say that I am an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For their views and visions I'm looking for allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">In politics, I just started and your program will try to get majority support.</seg>
<seg id="50">Things I try to push myself, unless it does not work, for six years finish and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It kind of sounds like he Okamura Czech save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm no savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one person will not do anything, so I walked around a number of well-known people that would also stand as candidates for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went Radim Janƒçura, due to the amount of work declined.</seg>
<seg id="55">So at least I supported investigative journalist John Lorencov√° that go beyond the fraud with light heating oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I ran to the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm having second thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people could not vote, and those who followed, the majority of elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, so we are only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People dialed the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for your vision, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Are you thinking about setting up their own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">O that I had not thought, because I do not have time to read the past I examined each potential party member, and even I do not have money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do not have money for a presidential campaign in my transparent account is only 20,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Do not have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You're talking about equity returns, what's yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Private property estimated at about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I land about 25 million, ten million apartment, apartment for another eight million art collection of about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb per million and then I have a few million in the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Anyway Aston Martin I, because it was my childhood dream come true - I always liked James Bond, who was riding in the car, was courteous to women, and to fight against evils and abuses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do you drive Aston Martin, have assets of 60 million and have no money to campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say you want to change Africa, but their own money into it you do not want to give too much.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">That I have debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">The campaign I ran was 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, suggests that about my program is probably not that interested.</seg>
<seg id="76">A campaign is under no obligation to pay on their own.</seg>
<seg id="77">Campaign costs me basically covers what I would senatorial salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But it would nevy≈æil, for example, I could not pay the son of an English school, which is 30,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to make money, so do not run anywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So you continue to do business, you might live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Did you know that these activities mute?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it is not related to salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, my activities I am partially allayed.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the managing director of travel agency in the spring becomes my agent.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like me to be a Samaritan, who will save the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to make a living.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.</seg>

<seg id="13">And while the Commission still amazed looking around, shrugging his shoulders, piling cheeky Maas his gifts to each according to their size and activist reasoned speech ended by the words "Dear urban village!"</seg>
<seg id="14">So this is my proposal for a mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later the mountain for 30 million euros piled.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo : "The Germans must play a greater role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained when deciding on Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the U.S. and Europe by Stephen Szab√≥ Berlin teetering on the fine line of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle : Germany earlier this week, first signaled that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinians observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo : Germany does not support what Israel did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel prudent.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I would not support either the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, was too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came oo establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here nakonec prosadilo NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take on major international issues clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it's true.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy and the direction of policy, which was managed by the USA, so to speak, towards the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is made more difficult because the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Germans are therefore between two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them, they will play independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think the only settle into his role, but are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Foreign policy, which are in France or the UK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly does "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows readiness play in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitude of the U.S. or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, ie exports and its relationship with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany are to some extent non-economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">They had economic interests influence the attitude of the Middle East conflict and vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a large outlet in the Middle East, particularly in states around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful not to deterred the public, but the elite in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Absolutely plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I would not want it but not to ascribe too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">It plays an important role, however, in any event, in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Damaged relations with Germany, USA, when Germany for two important decisions abstained from voting, such as voting on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe and even in the USA good deal of understanding for the German attitude.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not think it was such a dramatic turning point as the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps from Germany that even chop some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">This fact indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">USA on the other hand clearly in favor of a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Exist between the United States and many European nations differences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences existed due to internal American politics always.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think the Obama administration has secretly considerable understanding about the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But due to the political situation there can not of course hold this position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think the difference of opinion really are not as big as it always seems.</seg>
<seg id="43">When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not at all seem very enthusiastic about Netanyahu policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the U.S. on one side and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that precisely this that makes it difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans it was of course a bit easier by a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They can not therefore be part of a broader line and must instead drive things forward from his own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">Surely they are doing with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe in the future of Germany takes a leading role and will push Europe into European attitudes.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Germany, of course, is not easy, not least the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It has always been a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play an independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as an important international player? He wants to take the lead role at all?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany it still is not used, it's still annoying, and for the country, for obvious reasons, is still hard to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany take a bigger role, resulting anti-German sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="57">It 's making things easier for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this perspective, in Germany more difficult position than the USA.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable to various neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">U.S. influence in European politics now steadily declining, EU, however, this vacuum is currently blank. Who's else is there?</seg>
<seg id="62">Germans will just have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they do not like it, they are uncomfortable and makes it much 's most popular - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">For this is hidden label that is entirely in China officially registered, but the original company does not have anything in common.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, enjoys protection so long as the true owners neza≈æaluj√≠ brand.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear whether domohou rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"For foreigners it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of the rights of the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week lands on my desk a new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Counterfeiters just a couple of extra letters so that they can log your brand.</seg>
<seg id="10">From brands such as Gucci and becomes Lu- Gucci and Prada instead have it registered Prada - Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, legally copied and German companies, like sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a file with records Trademark Office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14th September 2010 there have left one Chinese company to protect brand Zegna DF Puma. Artificial name that prey on fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and infringement of intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities are multilevel stores, which are almost exclusively sold fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochovy however, are different. On behalf of their agents shall proceed against the Chinese company received from the Trademark Office officially quite right to use the name that is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai" associated brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">This is meant to women who hunt rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Damaging to trade, we have to fight," invites Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, image damage is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and legal costs affected Sectors go into the millions, especially for precious demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data from market research firm CLSA China with 15 billion euros per year, the third-largest luxury goods market and the market, which is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="25">Deletion of the offending entries in the index marks can be difficult to achieve, however, and it costs money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Management may take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the action because the name was criticized for a long period of time "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When the plaintiff unlucky plagiarist must still pay because the damage its brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.</seg>
<seg id="30">Known cases pertain to graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with a construction machinery manufacturer Sany, now, who recently took over the German pump manufacturer Putzmeister concrete mix.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese therefore still may use the emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used blue and white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely logo had changed.</seg>
<seg id="34">Manufacturer of fashion items Lacoste lost to counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile who turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">CTMO Trademark Office acknowledges that in 2010 there were shortcomings because of too few staff and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">But last year, said "the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Closed 57 were 000 such cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still waiting for the office still 81,500 complaints pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Something to take it is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is often the case in China, are impressive numbers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, which is nearly a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">That's a record and it means China for the tenth time in a row leads the list of new applications worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is also true for the number of valid trademark - there are a total of 5,500,000.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">It simply means that each log, on average, worth 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Start against litigation costs several times as shown in the case of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm has more than seven years of fighting the Chinese forgers.</seg>
<seg id="50">Germans were achieved that were canceled its illegal manufacture of imitation car parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the forger clinched Chinese rights to the brand Freudenberg continue.</seg>
<seg id="52">Sami we failed, because in Germany last name can not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">Trademark Office CTMO then also rejected the plea of the Munich company.</seg>
<seg id="54">In two other instances, although Freudenberg achieve right, but the defendant in a dispute struggles continue to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It must be terrible to give careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says : "Management is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs can not be quantified. In the archives of the company even had to see a century-old writings, to present evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg counterparty vainly offered a "high six-figure euro amount" in order to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"From this we see what it means to us," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is the danger of hitting the Far East and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And in this case, when there imitators provide a generic brand.</seg>
<seg id="64">One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted in Germany Freudenberg login sign for shoes and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of business concern long ago gave up, still managed to avert registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It is necessary to pay attention terrible," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He also Pattloch lawyer advises German businesses to be in business with China very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners would rather have "anything in any way worth protecting, log in China," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed : if the company Freudenberg in the last act of his drama, succumb to brand, then you probably will have to pay royalties to the counterparty in its own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we pushed in the disputed segment of the market.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most serious sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial SPI belong syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral SPI are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Munk and parasitic mites belong to the SPI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to the group most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea are found primarily among men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis were reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">For heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydial infection, Trichomonas, Candida (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV among heterosexual adults in our extended relatively few, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV accounted for by this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among adolescents with chlamydial infections occur much more frequently than other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections involving young people 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">For us, moreover, often occur among adolescents human papillomaviruses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As the number of infections developed?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases should be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">Number infected with syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 from the disease in 2001 more than doubled to 3698 the disease in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">Number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007 decreases.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is about one- tenth less than the year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What signs point to an STD?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, do not cause pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect yourself?</seg>
<seg id="57">The risk of infection can reduce the condoms, however, offer one hundred percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">For agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted and infection from dirt and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend, especially for frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis can cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to sponsorship, charitable donations, and last but not least honor√°≈ô≈Øm that earns the choir singing throughout Germany, to collect some money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total, we have to Esitjeni sent around 200,000 euros," said association President Annette Lennartz.</seg>
<seg id="63">Manages money from Germany in the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who is able to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="64">It also takes care of the orphaned children found shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo, as in the Zulu language, says the old women are the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them even took 14 orphans, gave them shelter and care to ensure that the children came the time every day in uniform to school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Children who do not have anyone, they go to the shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman paid by the association as well as two cookbooks, cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">"Voices for Africa" in addition established a sewing school, built two coops and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had to do an HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is not granted. Although the disease in the country so obvious about it all is silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">King with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch black Africa, King Mswati III., Is known for its nem√≠rn√Ωm lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This state-sanctioned way of life carries among others to blame for the HIV virus in the past decades and spread rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But many migrant laborers virus spread throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that condoms are everywhere on free, " but no one is in use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To at least some support cultural exchange, traveling choir Imbongi once every two or three years together after South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, militancy, trust and confidence in the future of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent known from the times of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - this award not only brings humor and joy, but also has elicited tears of many wild frontier soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="11">How is dark and getting cold, start the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, nejpodmanivƒõj≈°√≠mu eat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You dream it raw and then it swallowed a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional firefighter, but also so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people eat small fish cubes and washed down with plenty of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink may trump odor.</seg>
<seg id="16">Several pieces try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, which was a long bus trip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different time when Norway was in poverty, and because there were no refrigerator, fish in the fall dipped in airtight barrels with water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and ate - no doubt senses dulled by alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Before one generation thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, the majority emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by the large amount of work, high earnings and comprehensive system of care.</seg>
<seg id="22">Swedes, the old rival, which was not long ago much richer than Norway, pouring into the country for work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">On rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, although quite smelly part of Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among expensive food market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost ¬£ 9 ($ 14) per piece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway to global reports often do not - and it seems that most of the population it that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremists who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still refer grudgingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead of shooting is called "event from July 22."</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians can hardly believe in the peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's oil and gas industry from the early 70th of the twentieth century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says feeding plates with ule≈æel√Ωm rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and blue eyes is surprisingly prototype Nordic welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We, as in you says, sensible people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, like most English people here, it is absolutely perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nep≈ôedv√°d√≠me, I do not like ostentation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway handle its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of the majority of the money invested in the special fund earmarked for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial collapse threw the money they had, the Norwegians had in their purse strings tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"Until we can ski in winter and summer go on trips, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"A rakfisk eat," he adds with a careless laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I'm standing in the snow in front of something to eat - rakfisku I've had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such a moose burger is definitely something different and beautifully juicy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening is stinking fish here again.</seg>
<seg id="42">Hotel, where I live, is one of the many places serving rakfisk to dinner where guests choose the best, or rather the smell most fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have a connection with a live television broadcast, in which moderator is surrounded with butterfly plate with rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What you have to score the finest fish up there in the mountains, Thore - Juergen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"This is our scoring Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Loud applause and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="48">Man falls from a chair, maybe worn out aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe fumes from all those fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a difficult start</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges they face, and the mixed expectations of its citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers enclosing several key routes into the city and causing chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The aim was not to prevent commuters in it to get to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto receives the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Facing a challenging task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico during the tenure of the outgoing Felipe Calderon did well economically, the country is in the grip of drug war, which have estimated victim took 60,000 lives in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has towards the Mexican people a big commitment in reducing violence," the president said Pena Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Suggest a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before shaking hands with U.S. President received President Pena Nieto political experience as governor of his home country Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Opinions on the new leader is different in his old homeland, a vast populous state surrounding the capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Straight man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo remember him for good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Citizens attributed to them by the development of tourism in the resort and build infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">Until now the city can be reached by one of the new highways that had Pena Nieto build. These highways are a huge improvement over leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plate with his name also hangs on the wall of a modern sports center and the stunning interactive museum on the theme of climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state MEP President Pena Nieto, institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Particularly interesting in hope and real change in the security and economy that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 uninterrupted years in power, the party was pushed PRI Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace Los Pinos in the party by Enrique Pena Nieto many expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">A statement of opposition rejects characterizing the new president as a man without substantive content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It's a very straightforward person, very impressed with the excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman, and especially the man who knows how to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state this is not the impression that she has from her former governor of many people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, can not be contrast with cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways recalls the very outskirts of Mexico City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A problem in the municipality are also hardy and city.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier this year, the army was called in to assist in managing drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly poignant is violence against women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Only in the last two years, the desolate places next to a huge garbage dump littered bodies of dozens of murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">While Pena Nieto was governor in the State of Mexico killed more than 1,000 women, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">At best, critics Pena Nieto said that during his time in office has failed to adequately address the problems of murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">And worse, his leadership accused of turning a blind eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, I byIrinei Buendia shows pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppressing tears.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of the Mariana committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived at her house, so it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Ms. Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">They were there to mark the beats and rigor mortis had already begun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">As her mother tells the story of Mariana looks down at the picture on the wall, next to the cross, on which the single word "Justice".</seg>
<seg id="40">However, this is, as the family exactly what they did not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">State authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, Worrier and k≈àouralka.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want you to just accept what they say and silent.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But it can not be right, when there was so many errors and omissions," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Sherpa, the president Pena Nieto received on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico hit by violent crime and the new president promised during his time in office will be his priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope it will be the same president as he was governor," he says in Valle del Bravo PRI deputy Olvera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fears most.</seg>

<seg id="1">My crisis Mexican- American identity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left; remind them of hard times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During his last trip to Mexico City, I barely got through the crowd and I into the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Arrows pointing to one of two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds and I did not know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California and all my life I've been called "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is ethnicity abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York called themselves "Italy".</seg>
<seg id="10">So after I finished the designation "Mexican American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the homeland of my grandpa was not necessary to use shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I have no vocabulary native speaker and I can not get rid of the American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out my American passport and stood in the queue for "Extranjeros".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I was thinking about the moment this week, newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">The program had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet : immigration, drug trafficking and trafficking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why the same probability that Mexicans stay in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">A Pena Nieto has vowed to continue the war against the Mexican drug cartels, though did not give any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relationship with the United States complicated and full of hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under threat of arms rewrite half of Mexico's territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So a minute after the U.S. official says something just a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans intervene in the sovereignty of its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">A children Montezuma steps out on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, for the most Mexico real challenge related to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">Those a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers opportunities, and others who do not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point our family tree a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent who was in Mexico denied the opportunity and had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than would seem to fit the profile of the person - dark skin, poor education, poor villages of origin, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though we now live the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">Is the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and view us as an inferior race that is not enough Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is their opinion only on failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico did not fail, he would have never left him.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we found none now trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that among Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is tension because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resent.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although it is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And while many Mexican Americans that I know do not feel like part of either.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">You get the best of both countries, but the roots do not have even one.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico looks to us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States are considered Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And that relationship even more complicated, they want some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned during my trip, reconnect with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to Mexican Americans working for Mexico as a "makeshift ambassadors" and represented the interests of the United Mexican States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We say to our fellow Americans, how wonderful it is to visit this country, and to put pressure on political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">No.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is therefore happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And thanks to income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are certain that this is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how to act with Mexico before one and a half centuries, and must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feels resentment for the way it dealt with their family members in the past much more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">We may have more "Mexican" than I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">End -fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such happening is futile.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, it changed many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. A first rocket from Gaza landed in the vicinity of Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But although it seems that Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict around them changing Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe it will cause their fight will be even bloodier than ever.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that it may break the deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that neither won nor lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems that at present there is not much reason for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the ceasefire closed on 21 November last, the fight this week strengthen the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which rules the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite killing several Hamas leaders and closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most pitiful and most populated parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently managed by his staunch rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, Hamas leaders very well assume that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, so that Hamas won the rich and powerful friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, resurrecting a regional power that was once the closest Muslim ally Israel, were added to the side of Hamas. Likewise, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering people from Hamas said that the Islamic crescent encircling around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the government party / militia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And above all, on the southern flank of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Murs√≠ho in Egypt, by far the most populous Arab country and the flagship, the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled in Egypt 30 years until his fall in 2011, Hamas had no time.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomacy with Hamas may appear as a player who can not be expelled or Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the contrary, Israeli hardliners come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system proved its worth and many rockets Hamas has been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israelis can sleep better - for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the diplomatic terminology America as unflinching as ever. Many European countries also accused Hamas of starting the final round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And most importantly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from Gaza since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, was relatively calm on Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which extends into the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protecting Jewish settlements, which is still growing despite its illegality under international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections held on the 22nd January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they really ruled the West Bank, it would neodpalovali missiles, as did their countrymen in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It will be better if we keep behind the walls and smack them when they poke heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Maybe hardliners win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, have little love for Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israeli defense expenditures are higher than the costs of its four Arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Start a new war with the local superpower hardly help new Arab governments recover its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that President Mursi collaborated with President Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire is a good sign and may be the start of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also, Israel would in the circumstances have to look in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination powder keg, which has one of the areas occupied by Israel explode - like a bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Already currently repression weaken the Jewish state and democracy demographics makes this worse, as the Arab population is growing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody attacks on Gaza to be held every few years to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic duty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both parties need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is that what you preach reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states, Israel ever cede the area for safety reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term there is little hope that the ceasefire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little more influence to promote this stuff.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which along with Turkey and Qatar must commit to stopping the supply of weapons into Gaza, is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on 1967 borders with replacing parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Arabs from outside must also push for agreement between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would create a Palestinian state made more than immediate offer virtual statehood at the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its part to how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term neglected the performance of its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House seems to be equally reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia, Act of nasty cigarette packs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the ugly green boxes that are the same for all brands of tobacco, as illustrated warnings for smokers and the sick part of the body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Come into force Australian laws ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and logos and brands with a generalized color olive green boxes with hideous pictures of the patients body parts and displaying the children and the sick newborns of smoking their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to various health warnings and images are compulsorily from Saturday only difference between boxes brand names that are printed in the same small size.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the highest mode in the world concerning the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by the vice rid of his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="7">It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking at the age of 26 years, 99% chance it will never begin to smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even very young children can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies try them together to sell their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and cites studies, for example, showed that children associate crown in the logo with the idea of to be a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry against the introduction of these laws lobbied hard.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"With this legislation, there are serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will bring more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other claims that the laws increased their trade.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha from the company Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging of silicon used to cover the disgusting boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal to the laws of the Australian High Court, has increased from almost zero sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that the company Zico has sold nearly 6,000 pieces of wholesalers and expects new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">It gives us a good deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a possible snag experts say the popularity of social media among the demographic groups to which the plan addresses.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that most vendors cigarettes hidden from direct view, the tobacco marketing has moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but can not restrict foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you're a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and left you only this small space to promote your products is your online space compelling place in which to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mrs. Freeman has seen an increase from brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out the "average Honza".</seg>
<seg id="23">We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who truly loves Marlboro cigarettes and put the work and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has looked at what to do with the new regulations, than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - the country of the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that no country in Australia significantly traded.</seg>
<seg id="26">Plotting SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek said the government had held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country, which in 2001 introduced mandatory warning picture.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">About stricter laws considering Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia resists.</seg>
<seg id="32">Pictures of me have no effect.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Just pull out a cigarette and shove the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying boxes with pictures of tumors in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, it's just one more reason to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, who owns a newsagent King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, said that due to uniform enclosures for him is even harder on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Unloading took me an hour, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world of continuous connectivity is not so bad to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of additional aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had plenty of time to think about boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty- free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come to get bored with praise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that for us (and our children) is a good idea to occasionally get bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can support creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And given that most of us nowadays is constantly connected to any screen, we have a chance to enjoy boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We therefore support the boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Year</seg>
<seg id="12">Zat√≠m nejsme schopni prov√°dƒõt p≈ôeklad z jazyka ‚Äûhavaj≈°tina‚Äú do jazyka ‚Äûangliƒçtina‚Äú.</seg>
<seg id="13">But to come back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom : A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, the boring long history," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii was a Latin inscription found on boredom, dating from the first century AD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After seeing the research literature and presentation of ideas audience of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not capable of doing."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom is different from the apathy that the person is not involved in anything, but I would be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says the apathy exists urge to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that the core of boredom is a "disruption of attention, coupled with a bad mood and feeling of slowly passing time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can be a lot like depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that while the relationship may have bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, they see a problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that they are bored, when we only have difficulty concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "The unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person reading an article from magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard so low that it barely noticed, while the third group did not hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard the silent television program, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you are trying to concentrate on difficult or engaging task, disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study authors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "such as finding bad components on the factory line, distracting music can help with that to keep you busy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, I now know that twisting and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, may actually help fight boredom and keep people physically attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that children who are allowed to fidget, to learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All of us have experienced boredom - delay of my flight, droning speaker, especially lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">For help with measuring boredom scientists in the 80th the last century developed a "scale for the propensity to get bored" (Boredom proneness Scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do, is repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have time to do them all.".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in terms of the need for more and different external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he said that he knew that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people is not given much control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question : "Is boredom good for you?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, gamble or abusing addictive substances as a way to relieve it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know the best thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and you use this energy to playing the guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you watch television, make you happy for a while, not a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you will not be bored, but learn how to self entertain or self drive, said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">A "this self- control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child will learn only how to entertain itself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think we really want to celebrate boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But nor should we respect it should not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when you are away from the constant chattering and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Profesor Eastwood souhlasil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We blame it on the need to bore you with more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's what people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly over-reactive," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain themselves when the noise stops."</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nineteen year old Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for what will soon be the head of state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which he used on her smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco said that one September day went with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - minor offenses, which is fine for every 100 USD - and was given a date for trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They treated us as criminals," said Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use answer depends hundreds of minor drug cases on the spot rather than on law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offenses for possession of marijuana has been here in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures were repealed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police Department stopped blaming adults aged 21 years and older for possession of small quantities, which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks in force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the plaintiff in conservative districts of Colorado declared that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains vote on preventing the opening of the new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This matter is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You scratch their heads and regulators in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="14">And looking how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale - all in the first term December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use at first and now recreational.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has regulated the market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council to grant licenses to sell alcohol Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Mr. Smith admitted no place or the system can not do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent by which we can manage," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Washington law, the so-called I- 502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will be no state licensing system, but legal possession yes.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are tricky mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the state directive on "adequate access" to a licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in cannabis to 330 meters away from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"No one will be more difficult to place the licensed trade in cannabis than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan Seattle area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, recently established research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21st November sent Police Chief Oates of Aurora, its officers, e - mail, in which they announced that the city prosecutor will not prosecute offenses for possession of small amounts of marijuana for every citizen over 21 years and that the police "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in northern Colorado is the District Attorney Ken Buck stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, 119 people, although many of them face additional charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses that were crimes when they occurred," Mr. Buck said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was complicated in places like rural district Mesa, where voters rejected marijuana initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest town of the district, already accusing adults for possession of small amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, decision support, but also decided not to reverse any pending cases hold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not think I'm wasting my time continuing enforcement until the change," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and legal system will never be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">A mixed reaction across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The District Attorney is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of laws relating to marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They spent so much of his life prosecuting people that still can not really accept that it is legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The first states that a small amount of marijuana as to build strength, Colorado and Washington are poised to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalized sales, also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government that he still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping to submit to the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several arrests sellers of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use it to get attention, leaving most of the federal government dealings with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While drug agents are unlikely to strike out the door to catch a small bag of the drug is likely to balk at allowing the state controlled trading recreational marijuana allowed by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on drug policy the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several towns of Colorado expects to process federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before election day some local governments approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, although it will take about a year before being able to open any shop.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the city of Montrose West State has proposed a six-month ban and it is likely that next week will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to find yourself in a situation where someone issues a license and then it will have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">I look at it, voted for the community, contrary to what the state has voted.</seg>
<seg id="47">There's really a lot of questions.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="35">My first lecture concerned the translation of the French text of the 18th century in English and what followed, I was not ready.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">I was doing pretty stiff.</seg>
<seg id="38">Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like cake batter was very bilious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or just stupid?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students giggling.</seg>
<seg id="41">My eyes welling with tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you read in your spare time took some basic French lessons, unless you're too busy social issues, 'said Professor Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Dismayed, I returned to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">At dinner in the school, I was sitting alone when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said gently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is a target.</seg>
<seg id="49">He for me is bad enough, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who lived at my school.</seg>
<seg id="66">He hated not only that it is conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher 's foreign policy, and one of those who write her speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">Almost there.</seg>
<seg id="68">This place hated for its parochialism and pettiness and his tendency to Marxist- deterministic view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he took the position of professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You will not be happy," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to commute from Oxford to his parents' house in London, seeking refuge in their metropolitan disinterested friends and family.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">He could not believe it.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies at Oxford in the forties were accepted by all political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted by frequent trips to London with my emotional strength to deteriorate.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his belief.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week, in the course of teaching, the other a professor of history in complete seriousness said I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="2">In four of the euro gamble carrier in Indonesian volcanoes with their lives and health, while tolerated 70 pounds of sulfur down the steep stone paths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">They are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case Wijaya Anta, one of the 400 miners who make their living mining sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of this, every day go down the pit to the bottom of the crater, where sulphurous gases escaping from the interior of the Earth and in contact with the air passes into the solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After chisel large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">The top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, is only 250 meters, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes to climb turtle pace up because they maintain balance and thoroughly counsels his steps, and collapsed to slip into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any misstep would happen life, as it happened a French turistce that years ago, fell from the rocks Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners at Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur, which are extracted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When you are at the top, making their way around the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and wearily away with heavy baskets to the weight which mining company ranked slightly lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi that the volcano has been extracted since 1960, and never paid his workers more than 662 Indonesian rupiah (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industries, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Because I normally wear 70 pounds, I earn about 46,000 rupees (‚Ç¨ 3.8) per trip," says Anto us, which usually undergoes three trips a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way he takes three hours and at the end is broken, but can earn as 138,000 rupees (‚Ç¨ 11.5) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems negligible amount so inhuman effort is three times what would be made in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The daily wage of miners here is very high. Example for the collection of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (‚Ç¨ 1.2) per day and pay for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros)," said Carrier, who previously worked on the holiday island Bali as a bricklayer.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (‚Ç¨ 6.2) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, an important reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulfur: "Married I was a young girl from Bali which is Hindu, and I took it to Java, to convert to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, bad breath for him, still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years Anto three times daily risks his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur on him already begun to take its toll, even though his face was protected by a mask and goggles.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, bad breath for him, still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price we must pay for it to achieve his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'll work for two years, because I want to open a business or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This likeable and intelligent young man stricken by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead of doing the work carrier.</seg>
<seg id="24">It shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers, and each day gets up at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur at night to keep the springs, and its characteristic yellow color changes in dark blue and September.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the surrounding darkness Fara Anto into the crater and illuminates your way through a small lamp which is mounted on the helmet and myself to spend the money bought.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 media brings baskets on their shoulders with the sulfur from the crater floor</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has a high income, the extraction of sulfur due to cost savings nezmechanizovala or provide carriers operating on their own and with such zeal, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (‚Ç¨ 2.5) of the premium for the shooting, which along with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (‚Ç¨ 1.2) park wardens collected from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," he says Madrusin, hefty 42let√Ω carrier that operates in Kawah Ijen past three decades, ever since he left school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Handle to lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it keeps working, "as long as possible" because they need money for the education of their three sons aged between 18 and 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I'm not going to retire, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulfur burning throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and grasps miners in dense fumes that come from volcanoes, miners are being told that none of them complain that they suffer from serious illnesses... But it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on his shoulders due to the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Unainik who balances his basket on his back, in their 53 years can load only 50 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his colleagues vydoluj√≠ in a volcano 15 tons of sulfur, which then three trucks to take home a steep path between bushes in warehouse Tamansari 18 km away.</seg>

<seg id="36">Of his five sons the eldest, thirty, also earns mining sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but the continual misery of one of the toughest in the world of crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts, performing human mules in Kawah Iljen.</seg>

<seg id="33">The government is trying to not build many small houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, began to influence the real estate business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Office for Urban Development began to regulate the number of small dwellings known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain urban areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have an area of 46 meters square and had great success in sales.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that these apartments can support the bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of development company EL Developers claim that their "shoebox" are selling much faster than larger homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"They are popular, so that will be sold within days to weeks faster than homes with larger areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However admits that the new standards set clearer rules to developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">too stressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules could aim at increasing the birth rate of the nation, interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district of downtown suggests that they do not have a big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, because so many people postponed," said a young officer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Other whether they have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">But for me it is important to rely on their own time and money, " says another, twenty-something, young man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention career, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So whether the government is trying to force any citizen to have kids, they are equally eventually Singaporeans who are starting a family on the last word.</seg>

<seg id="17">Among them is the mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porrasov√°, English teacher and graduate of education and teaching, is that to children and adolescents in social networks properly oriented, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">It states that: "The Internet was created as a resource for finding information, but if there were social networking has changed the rules of the game."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasov√° notes that academic Marc Prensky, graduate education at Yale University and author of digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">" Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We are digital immigrants who need to learn, and yet still teach yourself, " she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to disseminate, publish, and say, and what did not, in an age when it is not yet ripe."</seg>
<seg id="46">Also to be - in terms of area - sober, when what he most wants is to be liked, to have thousands of friends and think about the consequences, " he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to this specialist is the most effective way for children and adolescents show that it is private, asking questions that make you think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Telling them not to do something that does not work," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Furthermore Marrielos Porrasov√° lists some of the options : There are things that you would not tell a stranger, so why do it online?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: Would you like it if someone posted your picture as you published the friend's?</seg>
<seg id="51">You know what others publish about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When oznaƒçuje≈° people in the photos of the celebrations, these people ask you for permission?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more : Need to constantly everyone know what you're doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to realize that they have to behave on the Internet as well as outside of it.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"People outside the internet governed respect, ethics and other principles and the same should it be on social networks," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">surveillance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is essential that parents carefully read the rules of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">" If you understand the intricacies of every single have a good basis to make with the children talked about the consequences of opening an account on the Internet can have.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, in terms of age, or what is allowed to share or disclose, " he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Victims of AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the result of the test: HIV positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if lightning struck me," says the memories of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "slightly reduced", but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy had concealed it from her family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his illness itself on its shoulders and began to inform her. And it so hard that she celebrated 43 birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of the most ancient Units HIV patients in the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came in 1994 after a battle with illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 22 years, which was unimaginable at the beginning of the 90th years when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time with him or clinic director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) bye, "because he had a cut."</seg>
<seg id="9">Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible with this syndrome survive and live fully.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, a lot of people who know about their disease and come up when the virus caused havoc vys√≠lil body and immune system, and then become victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since he appeared in the world of AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases "a great success that the length of life of patients who timely and appropriate treatment begins, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head Units HIV in Civil Hospital of Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">And infection control specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but the length of survival and full of life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients the disease is diagnosed, the better are the that those who do not use drugs : those with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and those with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This simply means that the person who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, can these findings "in adherence to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained in an interview with a doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To emphasize this progress is worth noting that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate in recent years has significantly decreased in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Yearbook of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS were killed by national statistics, 60 percent of patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year so far 187 However, since 2005 it has provided universal access to antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why do people continue to die as a result of illness?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - "It seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's how I see it, this is happening in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least for the last 12 years we have not run out of drugs. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the status of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds a conclusive statement: "Nine out of ten patients comes when it affects some infections. All you need to do, we can more affect overall mortality, the disease is diagnosed earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer large-scale testing for the disease all persons who request them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal is consistent with specialists and officials from the National Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who have come to do tests to private labs just because it made his friend, despite her young age at his already erupted AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, cancer, which is one of the common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Basketball globetrotter H√©ctor "Hetin" Reyes was with this sport mainframes connected more than 60 years and traveled with him around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories for local basketball history, as has H√©ctor "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Reyes was before him in 2008 caught the stroke on the wheelchair, passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, both as a player younger categories, player in the National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach Vaqueros de Bayam√≥n in the National Basketball League, and President of the Puerto Rico basketball Federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I Held during his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time as when I was 90 years president of the National League BSN, director general of the national team and the President of the Federation," recalled Reyes reporters during a visit to the newspaper Primera Hora at home in Bayamon, where he lived for more than 50 years, with Isabel, his faithful wife.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes in his assertion exaggerating.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs of his long career, to testify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Zat√≠m nejsme schopni prov√°dƒõt p≈ôeklad z jazyka ‚Äûhau≈°tina‚Äú do jazyka ‚Äûangliƒçtina‚Äú.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the greatest emotion of all the guards, which are reminiscent of his work in los Vaqueros since the mid- 50th years, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time celebrated 15 years as co-owner and team owner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">" It was the best summer that I enjoyed the most, because I had the chance to los Vaqueros team since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the period from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when he made his debut in the BSN Jerome coins.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was formerly a coach at that time was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said :" I have a grown -foot player.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want it? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players, Puerto Rico has ever had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow me then recommended Gausseho point guard Raymond, who joined the team and one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember being told that if Minco will Bayamon win the championship, Gauss and contributing to the next. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship, which the team los Vaqueros played Gauss, enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988, has served as President of Basketball Federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time he wanted to devote his full functionality and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"I remember the first time we beat the United States in Olympic qualifying match in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up fourth, but we have bronze but for the Canadian judge, who let us repeat the final face-off, " said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Is the team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we vypr√°skali team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which we blew a bronze medal at the World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopez "Piculin" (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) "Tonita" Col√≥n and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales that could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team that might not be perfect composition, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, it was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuqu√©n, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players on the roster, as were "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner who replaced the player is sent off for a skirmish in the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions we won gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It was without any doubt Piculin Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">None of Puerto Rico reached at this level such results as Piculin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to mention his work in various leagues, where he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Mel√©ndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the very young to me like Leo Arilla work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">That his success in the Federation is the biggest?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">That I was part of the era 's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995 and the beginning of the 90th year 's National League BSN in a single season to 17 teams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> What you missed the show?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things I wanted to introduce a youth division categories by region.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that boys from Ponce played only in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now kids travel a lot and play games too, which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also see the benefits of mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, referees and assistant referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am pleased to do so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What we are now engaged?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most listen to music, watch videos on YouTube with the music of my time, enjoying grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.</seg>
<seg id="49">And of course I enjoy the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.</seg>
