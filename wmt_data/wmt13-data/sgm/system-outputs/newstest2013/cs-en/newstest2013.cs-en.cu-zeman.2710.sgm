<h1>
<seg id="1">The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify its policy of necessity in the fight against electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennan's center, however, such a hoax calls the myth that electoral fraud is less frequent than in the US, the number of people who die after lightning struck.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, after all, for the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures will erode part of America's democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada are in the US responsibility for organising the federal elections by individual states.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is in this spirit that most american governments since 2009, promulgated by the new laws, which make it difficult for the selection process, or to register on the electoral roll.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has ballooned after the elections in November 2010, during which had 675 new republican representatives in 26 countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 bills restrictive electoral law in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters to present identity card with a photograph and document the american citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">These laws also restrict the period for elections in advance, override the right to register for the list of voters on election day and taking away the right to vote to citizens' entry in the register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to present půkazu identity with a photograph of any US state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first state that this requirement was introduced, Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutionality of the law indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican offices, with the extension of this process, as well as other countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last two years to support proposals for such laws in 34 states, with the aim of forcing voters to submit identity cards with photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, in contrast to the Quebec are not american citizens universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, half-11% of american citizens, i. e. the 21 million people aged to choose, no identity card with a photograph issued by the government of their country.</seg>
<seg id="20">Also doesn't have an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">The acquisition of the identity card, moreover, often costs more than $100.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions will disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of african-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of people over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years, therefore, does not have the required identity card with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that is not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, who are as voters known for their conversion to democratic candidates in several states are not allowed to use their identity card with a photograph issued by the school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other side of the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs who elect more republican candidates, cards issued by those clubs in the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, did not require any state election proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such a requirement introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011, about a dozen states adopted laws that require voters to show that they are american citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">The measures aim to limit the number of votes from the hispanic community.</seg>
<seg id="31">To note that two of the three hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators in 2011 to support in eight states laws that cancelling the registration of voters on election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those restrictions have its consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register some 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken in 2009 but caused a drop in when registering new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican legislators, then in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for the election in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were african-american, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although african american voters in this state was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">For Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">Accounted for only 11 percent of all voters, but 24% of people voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of the total electorate, were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Critics of the laws, which restrict the voter registration, is, of course, very strongly built democratic legislators and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors have blocked its veto several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">They have managed to limit the damage, in part.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, laws requiring the identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly-introduced rules, however, quite definitely will make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics talk about bias approved laws and consider them to be a clear attempt to influence the outcome of the election in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report from the Centre of Brennan's 2011 shows that in states where such laws are approved, 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes to the electoral system, will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain already: this new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures will erode part of America's democratic system.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The detection of prostate cancer: tests or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The dog was often incorrect test results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of this has contributed to the reluctance of men, who are already reluctant to test to come at all.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let's investigate or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of the two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the United States showed the high level of contamination between the groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time by a european, found different mortality rates among patients who undergo testing, and those who didn't.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also showed after 12letém apart, that those who don't have to be about 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore commend examination from 50 years of age or from 40 years ago, if your direct relative had had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men are also at risk of having an african-american origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to make the correct decision, once cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive forms of cancer and those species which are inert.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to explain to the patient's risk of cancer, offer a possible alternatives, not necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which is not in the long-term impact on life, and focus in these cases more on active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, the number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer, if left untreated, because the type of cancer is aggressive and threatens them for life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We propose to them instead of active surveillance, and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater precision, establishing criteria, which will help in deciding which type of treatment and which do not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Still, I therefore recommend testing.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to have an interview with the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to take a test or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with international companies urologickou Movember movement has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with the dog.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document can be downloaded (currently in English, translation will be available later at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Disease prevention</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there are no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">In spite of the progress made in the research seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease acceptance of the principle of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all the healthy eating and not moving, you could prevent up to 30 percent of cancer cases.</seg>
<seg id="25">“If they stop smoking, this figure would be increased by at least 50 %,” underscores the Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some percentage also remains totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the canadian company for cancer research remains a priority in the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also risk factor for several more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Today is in Quebec, 1.5 million smokers,” she says, shaking her head spokesman Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">The encouraging figure: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, decreasing the risk of dying of cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Well, and obesity, according to the SCC another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">To increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">“The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon,” says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommended limiting the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">At too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is best to avoid and sausages, which are subject to the same thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of smoked meat, dried or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">“May cause damage to cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer,” says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, scientists have focused on the link between vitamínovými supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Polls, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are according to the SCC contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, and other studies are on the increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is clearly shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Beaulieu also insists, as it is important to talk about their concerns and the precedent of families with their doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">“To undergo testing does not mean that you have cancer.”</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson explored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Notification of a possible discovery of Higgs bosonu last summer caused an uproar.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that the bosons are involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And there is also the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model-our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior — which has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Among physicists, however, still isn't 100 percent certainty that the Higgs boson goes on.</seg>
<seg id="6">No doubt about it, is that we have a new particle, which is very similar to those Higgs bosonu as predicted a standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">New data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirmed, however, there are no more all the data, so that we can have absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, let's assume that the Higgs boson, as regards the risk of error is so small, and let's see what this is all about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world is quite unambiguous Act, under which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule cannot be ignored — and not to try too hard, otherwise they will hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even if it is a very strange world of particle physics, it also shows that there is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state” - the “state of emergency”, roughly speaking, creates some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Particle physicists have further divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, we can find good citizens, or fermiony, obediently follow Pauli principles.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end of the range, the mean-spirited bosony anarchists who are contemptuous of anything — certainly not this principle, which means that they may still be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony is further divided into two groups according to equipment (by the way most exciting), which is the particle Adventure, in laboratories Berkeley mesony: here we go unnoticed, and “containment” particles, which are spreading the forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is probably not related in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, it should be said that these bosony aren't as exotic pets, as it would have been possible to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you read this article, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual truism: the photon, or “particle of light”, which is “a” electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the particles with electric charge faster or change its direction, “disturbed” that electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this “distraction” is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than the photon-and thus one of bosonů, winners of the “power”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It's also with the Higgs bosonem, except that “victory” is taken to other fields, the Higgs field, to make this a boson appeared.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Higgs field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; to his excited, it is necessary to achieve a very high energy levels, as with the frozen surface of a pond, has thrown a big rock.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as an accelerator at CERN laboratory-the Large Hadron Collider is friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop that kind of energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field with us again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">With the electromagnetic field respond, all of the particles, all of the materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do so, but not other-a piece of paper, for example, would never be on his own hold on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the same applies to the Higgs field respond all particles: those that do have some mass, while others (such as, for example, a photon, let us look at it) don't have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Mrs. Smith asks why all this research is, “what will we?”</seg>
<seg id="29">From the point of view of science to confirm the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to test any inconsistency between observations and predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many physicists, moreover, are literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space “new physics” and to close some of the loopholes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is the need to conclude that the model is still huge shortcomings, there's no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter again (oops!).</seg>
<seg id="32">CERN facilities so far, though, such contradictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The response</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Responses to these surveys in day-to-day life of Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Behold: at the beginning of the 1960s, were pioneers of the Bell Labs didn't know about the revolution, for their work to inspire.</seg>
<seg id="36">Assuming scientific use, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I said the laser was initially regarded as a “toy in the lab.”</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides, the result may even from all the instruments, which surrounds the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during their works to the lens.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though that Boyle initially didn't plan this, now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras in the world and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC we urgently need to change your life, but does that mean that no one really knows.</seg>

<seg id="5">The magazine le Devoir tried to look at the issue in more detail.</seg>

<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, which was consuming him, gave him a two-year suspension.</seg>
<seg id="8">“I was given five years of my life and it's been seven,” he says without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">“But it is still a shock for this, you can't prepare for,” he says.</seg>

<seg id="14">“My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, the shaming me,” she says.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“It depends on the skills of the man's” whether the return will take, says psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the view of many people who deal with palliative care, the crucial moments occur in the heart of a return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who are stepping into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, everyone is suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">The forecast is for a maximum of three months to live.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them, to provide so-called “therapeutic” care.</seg>

<seg id="32">It is very little if we realise that we all have to die.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">“For the last six months, there is always a three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer in 45 years,” says Dr. Christian Martelová with concern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients in the home of Victor-Gadbois comes, here comes from their homes, 47% of the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i. e. to care, which is intended to reduce the suffering, as soon as the sick, in the final stages of their lives, whether it's at home, in a hospital or nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and company for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montreal specialize more or less exclusively to the care given to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And it is precisely this lack of essential medical care in Quebec has led to a number of doctors specializing in palliative care fears the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, as evidenced by its opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christian Martelové Quebec health system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all people to high-quality palliative care before it can agree to perform euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, has recently experienced patient who spent 14 days on standby in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="52">Fears that patients ask about the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, many oncologists care for patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my onkoložce, Down with treatment, she said that she regrets that don't fight, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">And he told me that it was over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is a powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to your treating physicians, that their desire to fill them, as a team of palliative pussy eased the pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it is to say that palliative care is not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to reliable Monereauové, director of palliative care at the company's domestic palliative care for the Grand Montreal, patients are defending the treatment of pain in 8 percent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until death, whether by fits and starts, or whether he is a sedative administered on a permanent basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Unable to pretend that this part of the suffering we do not see eye to eye.</seg>
<seg id="63">The patient, who don't get rid of the pain, will always have more opportunities to access paliativním sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">The sick, which is given a sedative, always say the same thing: “I want to die.”</seg>
<seg id="65">But that's not always necessarily mean “I want to provide the euthanasia”, it means more to me, “I want to get rid of the pain.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Administration officials, entrepreneurs in the construction and public works, lobbyists, political parties and experts on the italian Mafia still tell what they know about a “system”, which is a mixture of construction, state officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia.</seg>
<seg id="3">This “Scope” came from Quebec taxpayers dearly in particular between 1990 and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“It is interesting how the system crumbled since we take strong measures,” says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec parliamentarian and former chief of police in Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thanks to this scandal erupted in 2011 on the basis of rigorous investigation focused on the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts to build roads in Quebec, which then-liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest has approved only after long delays.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Duchesneauova” report confirmed a direct link between industry, murky financing of parties and corruption of public officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">“Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010,” he says, “save a Ministry of Transport on procurement billion dollars,” when some people keep a tight rein on their instincts to get their share.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Commission has already brought “Charbonneauova to resign two mayors,” he adds, with the hope that the country will be able to “uncover the subtlety of some people”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A drive to combat corruption, based in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A drive to combat corruption, based in 2011 is also involved in the fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.</seg>
<seg id="11">A police “Marteauovy company”, who since 2009, in order to ensure that the “cartel penězovodů significantly reduced inflation contracts…”</seg>
<seg id="12">In recent weeks, carried out a series of searches and charges of fraud and corruption, many local councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a village on the outskirts of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has resigned from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is suspected that repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Lino Zambito caused a sensation when he explained the mechanism of the “system” of public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">He gave during these years of 3% of the value of the contracts, which v Montréalu acquired a middleman, associated with the Mafia, which then transferring the money side of the union, which campaigned for Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Zambito was after the year 2000, generous to all parties and has donated more than $88,000 canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) provincial parties, but especially the liberals, who were in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted to arranging illegal source of funds for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The contract with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal was a “system” of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, from the very detailed: over the course of a decade, it has received from construction companies, presents an invitation on trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and pocket money worth a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with penězovody which nadsazoval price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they have had to pay fees for about 30% to 40% overestimate invoices through false víceprací.</seg>
<seg id="24">The organizer of the mayor's party Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of unabashed shutting his eyes to a parallel budget, which in its treasury was dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which put Montreal into large-scale crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými members who issued a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="27">As the Mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island since the year 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million promotérům right in the middle of the thriving trade in real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of dirty money in election campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The investigation, which will finally be brought, he says, that “pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrene and načapalo culprits”.</seg>
<seg id="30">The process is “painful, but positive”.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it is necessary to establish a v Montréalu own investigative unit and supervision to ensure that these dubious practices could return.</seg>
<seg id="32">As if to tidy up.</seg>
<seg id="33">On a regular basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public officials misappropriated by hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned, in particular the role of “members informed about this ruse”, as in the game-playing seriously!</seg>
<seg id="35">Estimates that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and with irony, adds: “I've heard that it's just a fact.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, but it will not resolve the situation: “until it is strictly limited election expenses, dirty money from politics will not disappear.”</seg>
<seg id="37">Proposes a comprehensive monitoring system for the award of public contracts and financing parties: “which we don't fall can; if we look boldly on the substance of things, we can build again on more solid foundations and with more control and respect for the law.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story defamed the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad Duchesneau recommends that all those who were laughing at him, to look at their own backyard.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">“PSG is FC Barcelona!”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season's PSG put on a completely new tempo.</seg>
<seg id="3">How to explain this development?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be explained by the fact that all of the individuals went to yourself, or an entirely new dimension of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">They came to us with the big players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day, in addition to getting them further.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical team has helped me a lot, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every day, these facts make it possible to raise the level of the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in games, it's not that easy.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football, it's all very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But don't lose your head.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my beginnings in college in INF Clairefontaine until after a stopover in Saint-Etienne, I have always been shifted to different degrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Taking advantage of a competitive environment, which were introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reinforcements from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it follows that a player like me have more flavor into the game and wants to bring maximum power.</seg>
<seg id="17">And in addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">The hand has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And Ancelotti has the final say in the nick of time?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti has the respect of all of technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today's 1. League peers and are among Europe's best coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has vast experience and with top teams won a lot of titles.</seg>
<seg id="24">He also worked with excellent players.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to me in Paris to win more titles.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had a number of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trust me, it provides another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How do you feel about the first part of the season, PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">1. the league's Lyon took the leading position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But staying in tow.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League: very easily, we climb into a he.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is your club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We are going to try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be for a good european teams are tough customers.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all, we want to win their qualifying group against Porto, so we could play in retaliation he at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the PSG stand in the short-term, a major european club?</seg>
<seg id="39">The budget for it.</seg>
<seg id="40">That Paris has become a major european club must win titles and go down in history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the financial side, PSG means that this project could take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a big setback in nezvítězit 1. as in the league last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year I really want to win a league title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In last season's still missing.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had an excellent season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We picked 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is usually the case that with 79 points are clear master.</seg>
<seg id="51">But there is another club, Montpellier, had the season even more amazing.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think that this year's lead.</seg>
<seg id="53">Although the title to big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think, that we have the weapons to beat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from PSG are expecting too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect from us a lot, considering what's invested and what our players.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is receiving.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is a fact that when he beat Troyes 4-0, and still find something in our newspapers complain, so it is not very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what you people still can't ask for more.</seg>
<seg id="59">Clearly, winning 4-0 on every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We're not FC Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to set up a game style.</seg>
<seg id="62">You need time to build a team.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League, we demonstrated that we can play.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season, and yet he also invested huge sums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the sums invested might be expected to be in front of the other 15 points ahead.</seg>
<seg id="66">The names of other clubs and the french league.</seg>
<seg id="67">Clubs Lyon and Marseille, in last year's season very subtle, with new PSG moved into the next phase.</seg>
<seg id="68">It shows how the League 1. amazing.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as if PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is a good thing that says that there is a “dependency on Zlatanovi”.</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful and that gives a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Because of that came here and shows that it is the star of 1. League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever they went, he demonstrated that he is a big player, a global star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our team, we respect the person and player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What has been achieved, it is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This led the other to raise their own level of the game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows other side-by-side growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you have experienced the Euro 2012 with France's entertainment?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I don't want to play this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, because of the injury I couldn't play as well as I had imagined.</seg>
<seg id="84">But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I was doing in representation play good matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">And that's what I was hoping for from his team.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned our lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and today, we owe it to ourselves, to our performance has been exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">How do you see the first month Didier Deschampse led the national team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Speaking on behalf of his results.</seg>
<seg id="90">In qualification for MS are in a good place.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can sell for victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">That was even Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't want to be compared.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has achieved its objectives that we have qualified for the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps leading our team in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">It is a draw (1: 1) of 16 October in Spain a solid baseline game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game has added confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">We have all fought for the team.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this shock in Spain was in his career before this game.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanks to Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">All the negative effects of the current financial transactions based on central banks, and the cost of processing transactions identified among the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="3">As it is in the context of these technologies often true, there is a feeling here the political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies that leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Bitcoin, whose inventor's Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual money (but not transferable to dollars, euros, etc.), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar BitTorrentu, which allows the exchange of files between two pairs of partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to the 15,000 computers connected to the network have already been registered around 200,000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The course bitcoinu first reached peak 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, about five months later fell to $2, today it is on the verge of about 10 dollars (overview of the courses can be found on page bitcoincharts. com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison with the World in exchange for real money or financial products that isn't impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) for the interest in its report on the virtual finances, which came out in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin refers to as “the most successful virtual money”, “competing with the dollar and the euro” and “the equivalent of current money”.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin from other types of virtual money differs in that it is the “credits” to be used for the procedure in a video game, which gets in the game or that they can buy (and sometimes even back change).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Social networking site Facebook has also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Every month, but the central government controls and processes the communication.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoinu nodes of the network are all the book's current accounts, supervisors, issuers and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How it works?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users are actually between two electronic addresses via e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the user can choose another address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network so it can verify the transactions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key lies in this new phase of the transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is help solve mathematical task the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the stage of cutting up the file; i. e. the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computer “take over” the new transaction and added to her number, then the whole “cut”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find a number that provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number will find other nodes easily check its accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then unremittingly displays linked to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have to change his fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wanted in order to commit fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions — the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that challenge would win 50 bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to avoid inflation, shared this reward regularly two, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoinů in circulation is such a limited number of 21 million, however, they can divide up the part in nine hundred million, so the room for margin here is …</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the job also increases with increasing levels of calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network has had its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and there has been an estrangement between imposed bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Exploited a flaw does not concern itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, company payments for real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering from this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the problem is also true for cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like WordPress blogging platform is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizmannova Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book's current accounts, and showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, introduced “huge discounts.”</seg>
<seg id="42">“Thirty thousand dollars have changed,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaged in converting bitcoinů into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books relating to these funds, has a great deal of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu pay phone, but uses a system for verifying Bitcoin transactions, which are due to cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, manages the winner of their identity and so can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easily sets for traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Enough to address that can be called “ofotografovat and recognize,” explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">“Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive,” predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB, in its report, moreover, it implies a re-evaluation of the various risks, which are now considered to be increased, if this kind of money will be successful.</seg>

<seg id="15">Kabul was empty, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their take control of the country was regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghans have paid a price for the obscurantism of the peasants, who completely dominated the organization Al-Ká'ida, their situation is, however, in our time has not improved.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and the current talibánci agree in an attempt to keep women in a subordinate position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main dignitaries from the war against soviet troops returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They became hustlers, seized by the state-owned land, which they sell as building sites for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and use the huge american contracts for sub-contractors.</seg>

<seg id="32">The former commanders of the fight against the soviet army already renewing provincial militias that are beyond the control of the central authorities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should should look forward to a certain degree of decentralisation, along the lines of the western states, but the US had wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so we have to abolish the post of prime minister, which existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai doesn't want foreign control, especially when elections are planned for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">The country, however, is from the 1950's and early years heavily reliant on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">No industry was unable to recover, no dam doesn't work, there is no fundamental repair irrigation system.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; nothing to produce, fruit and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">Preference is a private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country devastated by three decades of war would be necessary government control infrastructure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Rumors flew that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">And that's just fueling the feeling that western countries were only to be seized.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without the energy to process iron ore and copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no mineral extraction can take place.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese are already almost abandoned a copper mine Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area to keep their role as the biggest employer in the province.</seg>

<seg id="1">Difficult to work on the egyptian constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Mohammad Mursí turned to another game of poker.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided over the declaration of the Constitution, which grants him temporarily unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the views of all the others that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago by the head of state to this assembly for the next two months to complete the necessary work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For nearly two years, Egypt uses a text, which had been completed, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to legal controversies.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the point of view of the opposition the president persists in its “autocratic delirium” remains a “breach of its word” and “tramples on the right”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His followers, however, to assure themselves that this is a way of quickly turn with the constitutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">In two weeks' time, there should be a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood's intention to withdraw from the Egyptians to clarify the text of the article by article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way to regain the national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country being rocked by protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed by in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians to vote in favour.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the egyptian people before the ultimatum: “either approve my text, or keep the unlimited powers”, which otherwise would have come to an end after the adoption of a new constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with a large majority, approved the text of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, slamming the door, with the result that they have the opportunity to promote their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities in their step followed suit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning, quickly followed by 11 people from the ranks of the reserve.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often passed unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes is the day revolved around an hour for prayer, when some members of the committee were of the view that an hour in the conference room are not properly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The subject of the limelight, Article 2, remains at the end of the day, identical to the version of the 1971 constitution, stipulates that “the principles of sharia law is the main source of law”.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi party, for which it is the introduction of islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoping to replace the term “principles” with “rules”, which would allow more stringent application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that it had not been repaired, is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Hypocrisy”, say the liberals, who sees this as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, namely the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Focusing in particular on article 220, which confers on the University of al-Azhar advisory role, especially on issues of monitoring compliance with the laws of sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové is a disturbing, because “persons called the comments are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see this as the beginnings of a theocracy.”</seg>
<seg id="32">Liberals fear even more stirring up the fact that the next president of universities should be less moderate than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">“For the moment, there was no specific religious implication.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the Constitution remains Egypt in general terms the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university researchers, many of them studied in french schools,” says concerns Alexis Blouet, who is preparing to work on a constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, agrees that “there may be differences in the interpretation of Article 220, because in the words used belonging to religious terminology.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is, in particular, a reference to the “fiqh” [islamic jurisprudence, while].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future it may occur, the question of to what extent they are civilian judges responsible for the chance to express themselves”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday approved the text is in addition to religious sites very criticized because of the enhanced powers granted to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in their relative to the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: the powers conferred by the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the army will verify the defence budget to Parliament, but the National Defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Then, in military courts prohibited procedure with civilians, as requested by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These associations are talking in connection with the text that they think it is directed against the freedom of its misgivings.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the offense is still banned, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">No article is also involved in the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová from Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point of the ban on torture, referred to in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was mentioned in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the egyptian president had last night to take part in a televised speech, to this afternoon's planned rally.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state will demonstrate on Saturday.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other russian cities comes every year, 13 million foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On December 1, entered into the effectiveness of the law, under which each migrant workers will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">FSM, however, promises that, over time, the tests will be compulsory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The tests, however, will be composed not only of language skills, but also of Russia's history and of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language, it will also be necessary to confirm and extend to obtain a work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">The law does not apply to people who have successfully managed to reach the attestation and obtain academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits of conviction and the protection of the rights of the</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network test sites will operate under the auspices of the poet Institute of the russian language, the University of friendship between peoples, the Moscow State University, State University in St. Petersburg and other russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants can pass tests in all cities; it is already in Russia to more than 160 such centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to promote the introduction of testing, supported by members of the State Duma and the FSM (federal migration service).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, human rights defenders are often put in the press question: and what it actually bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">So, in particular-are representatives of the migration service-this will make it possible to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the “slave labor.”</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, says the chairman of the board of directors of Russia's Viktor Sebelev FSM in Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only organized recruitment system will enable from 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise in emigrants without occupation, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the knowledge of the language, he says, with the conviction of Sebelev-is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with bad people who, under the pretext of helping ensure “order” to the ghastly, cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, languish for months without food and documents and to work for 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">“In their own country they are promising one, but upon arrival is false, confiscate their passports, paid the promised wages,” says Chief of the Tajik government labour migration of MS Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Don't scold!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of the central asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only don't know the language of the country in which they want to get to, but they don't have the experience or even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not their fault, rather like a disaster: only a very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families also need something to feed the kids, not to mention the fact that it should be a nice dress, and fit into the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children grow into adulthood, must be the first chance for work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">“Do you feel humiliated and degraded.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that with regard to the language tests indicate human rights defenders in one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If they have not, and will not pass exams or receive no further official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the greatest number of migrant workers as well as before in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">“Welcome, or unauthorized entry prohibited”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the immigrant workers argue that to have official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason-bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the legalization of costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But with false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Employees of the russian police know that we are essentially false documents, without registering, and there are cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">“Require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea,” - he shared with the press about her experience as a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“Well, don't be stingy, buy a painting.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the validity of the law on the language, it was discovered that false documents are not only migrants for registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">Employees of FSM have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of language tests.</seg>
<seg id="48">Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners won't be free: each of the migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with tests, paid the price for this document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times higher than their official test: it will cost migrants three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task of the near future, is to safeguard the system against corruption that workers could simply buy documents, in that match, government officials and human rights activists.</seg>
<seg id="52">Government authorities have so far may promise to foreign workers, who can't make up the first tests, needed time to have completed a course in the russian language.</seg>
<seg id="53">For visitors who can't Russian, is expected to work in areas where it does not require active negotiations with the people.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot sites that receive orders weapons</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first of them, “the army or military route”, that is to say the weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">“The weapons stolen from the russian officers and kavkazané themselves,” says Baraněc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The other type of “black” weapons are weapons stolen by criminals for representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that this includes the theft of police depots and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the law enforcement agencies in criminal proceedings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The illegal “mainly” comes into the sale of military depots.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military stores often leads to explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">“There is evidence that some of the fires were deliberately built-in order to cover a shortage,” says a former soldier.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">“Currently impose private armaments companies, which are not competitive on the international market, and decommission weapons, which supplies on the black market, including Moscow,” says the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of “black” market is smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">“That's where their production, sometimes there is weapons produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which organised their smooth production,” explains the former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where is the gun?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts count, which is the approximate percentage of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons in the “black market”.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this issue is handled in 2011 Center analysis of the problems and the design of public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Experts analyzed the records of the Ministry of the Interior and the Bureau of Statistics, kriminologickou russian literature and data from public data portals, focusing on the issue of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers, from military and executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons found on the black market “because officials, whose work is associated with weapons,” says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data, which are available to researchers, is 17% of weapons from armed conflict, in 14 percent of the cases occurred in theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is “black archaeology.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The salesman-consultant to one of the weapons, which asked to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the “black sites” archaeologists long ago nobody buys — are simply too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">More often than not, he says, the sellers rides for new shipments directly into military depots.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the Ensign clients buy unit, for example, the TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">For him, the use of a weapon, and he'll sell it over the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">“That would take her to the city and it sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines,” she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">“The truth is that the police are well on track, and that is why, whenever they start burning plan in the detection rate for crime victims, made the purchase for traders with illegal weapons,” says consultant.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, offer a pig in a poke-everything you can try.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, a potential client, simply buy-let's go with the seller in the woods and that we build a target.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the US, the workers are on strike and supermarkets fastfoodů</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Work on the premises “McDonald” goes up to a quarter of all american teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the past few days in America raised a wave of protests against low wages in the company's malls and Wal-Mart in restaurants popular fast food chains, such as the “McDonald's”, “Burger King”, “back Bell”, “Wendy's” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave into a wave of nine, or whether it is doomed to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This whole share support trade unions and many left-wing social organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the modest ​platů receiving rank-and-file workers in Walmart and systems of fast food, is the aim of the organisers of the protests to achieve in their creation in their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, this economic sector virtually intact for the labor movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called “Black Friday” when America struck an orgy of low-priced sales by millions of people and, in some cases, was accompanied by the brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some workers the company Wal-Mart, in which around the world working to 2.2 million people abandoned their work and demonstrate together with trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals supermarket chains, whose goods are addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Wal-Mart sold throughout the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores are, on average, about 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability of a range of goods made from a chain of Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of critics, he can afford to sell goods cheaply and Walmart, partly because few pay their staff.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators on “Black Friday” demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the costs of the health insurance provided by the companies have risen sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Wal-Mart worker receives 9.5 dollars per hour, but it does not correspond to the level of spending, say officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage of about $12 per hour, it would cost the company $3.2 billion dollars per year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's in an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company moves Walmart wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, will be a visit to a state only about 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as a whole, consumers spend approximately 39 dollars more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Wal-Mart's defenders point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Black Friday” in the company's stores lasted from 8 p. m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time the company Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, the Treasury made in “Black Friday” almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was only “other media sensation”, organised by the trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">“Treasury vacant!”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where their aims were trading houses Walmart (those in the progressive city are not too fond of, and therefore there are scarcely), but “McDonald” and cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says that sells billions of portions, and then you don't pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and the laws of the State of New York, $7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average, their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city, no-one can have lower wages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well, I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employment in the “McDonald's” goes through nearly a quarter of american teenagers who work behind the counter after school on a part-time basis and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people in that as their main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Currently, constantly in conversation with the staff of the “McDonald's” who complain that they have to live on that money, and some of them even to feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, in a forum on the Wall Street Journal's comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protest, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday for “McDonald's” at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the Treasury and cooks in fast-food companies started to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also demanded that in the realm of fast-food were established trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">America's laws forbid the administration to defend the formation of trade unions and to punish the activists of the trade union movement irritations and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other side of their management rarely makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">A fast-food businesses, trade unions, however, is difficult even for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is unusually high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Opposition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In this day of noisy protests also took place in a number of other low-priced Manhattan restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action was in the middle of the Assembly for “McDonald's” near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council, Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald's” says that sells billions of portions, and then you don't pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work!”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators have seen their support as well as other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill, who said that “we need to act together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve fair remuneration for their work and economic prosperity, it deserves every New Yorker!”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As he described the newspaper's New York Times, it was the biggest event of its kind in the history of America's sphere of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended by only a few hundred people, although not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Whether this event happens to be the spark that ignited the flame of a mass movement, is as yet unclear.</seg>

<seg id="1">“We are doing brain deceive average”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Among fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; recently, it means, in particular, view the world through the prism of the special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the year at its annual conference gave Google a working model of this news, and in November, it was announced that the application for the patent has also submitted a Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In an interview with the leader of a group of interactive 3d technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that for scientists, this company's glasses are already a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tempts them the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please tell us, in general terms, what does your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">The human race hasn't stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the best ever touching the screen with his finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, console and Xbox Kinect sensor-this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility through gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What is ahead of us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">— Not to mention that the Kinect system brought the interaction at the physical level, very much interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3d.</seg>
<seg id="13">The flow of information to improve the system takes a lot of data), but so far no flow of output.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that, we are working on a real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to allow the computer world into our physical world, make it more realistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this end, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in much better form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place — to hell with those silly hats, virtual reality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think of vocal control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It's a popular thing, but not exaggerate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Of course, it cannot be regarded as a panacea-raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for control of the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not the only one of such skoupých, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gestures would nesnímala camera equipment, but a bracelet to monitor the movements of the bone and muscle.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, there is a big but, in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, that future is the type of control, such as a gesture of + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">— And how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How, for example, ask me to give you the can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say it, and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">I usually just talking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">So you want to get users to adapt to what at the moment can or cannot machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is not necessary, but it's a mutual affair.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which can identify more precisely the reaction in humans.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser scanners, which provide relatively good in-depth resolution, that is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">If you have to talk about their work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands on modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is now sufficient detail, depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In essence, the current generation — that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be a good idea to raise 8 mega-pixels at a rate of 1,000 f / sec.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it's not just about megapixels, but like a nut and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">While looking at issue are all current technologies for us non-trouble designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y, but also from.</seg>
<seg id="43">So it is also vital that speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The human movement is quite dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our laboratories in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 milliseconds, while current, mass-produced scanners are closer to the other value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands, to what extent it affects the interaction of man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, it was a very useful work in the equivalent of such equipment, but I don't need as many touches, but I need some pictures per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And an increase in the number of cameras is necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In system Kinect are now used three “camera”, one of which is, in fact, an infrared transmitter and a second-set the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And already the third camera-that is, in fact, a sensor visible band.</seg>
<seg id="51">That is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">A greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse, because it would increase the necessary volume performed calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">If I remember right, Microsoft (unlike Google) presented publicly his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">Don't you think that, when it comes to day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Of course, walk and constantly keep smatphone in his raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be “portable” form of the extension of reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the platform, the clouds move at any time from his glasses on smart phones, the projection screen and around.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses-it is a very personal device, it is their strength (private things you only see you), and, at the same time, it may also be a weakness-augmented reality on the basis of spectacles will allow you to work on a virtual objects at the same time with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that tampering with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in “Iron Man,” but also ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one issue on which critics often point: there is no tactile feedback.</seg>
<seg id="61">His hand feels nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">In his lectures often say that augmented reality-it is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the addition of sensation, he could become the eighth spot.</seg>
<seg id="65">So far, is one of the more interesting tricks-the use of second-hand as a kind of background for display.</seg>
<seg id="66">An excellent way of recording the depression.</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding the appearance of solidity to these “images in the air” — for example, when a few directional ultrasound beams in the defined point the finger, causing tactile sense, but it is still very weak as if he was at his fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers-also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">If you're trying to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think, to feel what it appears that should feel at the moment when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- It is a good idea, that we haven't tried yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">There appears to be yet another challenge, which I will fight long-how to make a man who is physically located in a very tight space, to believe that is open, virtually infinite space-we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all, such as in clubs), moving platforms and also big balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, that is a job for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes the work of virtual reality so attractive to researchers, many things are in the very early days.</seg>

<seg id="10">Recently took up the organ and became the Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with all my life, and the philosophy of the bohemian image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Clive, why you're walking around dressed in red, and not in a yellow or, for example, in turquoise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose red as designer dealing with light and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, the red colour of compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the grey, aggression and brings out the bad.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my provocative acts is, above all, an invitation to debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">And when you know that you have to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- On display at the house of culture on and where they were exposed to my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understand what is my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then came a wave of old liberal unofficial artists and new, free of artists I couldn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="21">I was friends with artists, with a new wave of post-gazoněvskými, who led us to “puškinské 10”, and the next wave.</seg>
<seg id="22">That brings me to the theater, clothing, music, in all genres beyond words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">And all this is amalgamated in your art-clinic … - for me it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where should collect all the best powers of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I took place at puškinské 10, and there still existed before reconstruction musically-art club, a Bohemian Club, home of petěrburkské Bohemians.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the birth of many: NOM, Tequila jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought to the project “Van Gogh's ear.”</seg>
<seg id="26">Šnur and his friends sang the plywood easy songs, they dressed in full-length leotards, midway between them composer Igor separately, which is now in vogue.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the band began to play live, has become the “Leningrad”.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg led many programs in this-galivských times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtěnberga, that she began to his United career, basic education and training from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">The gallery “d 137”, “Griboedov's club-this is the aftermath of Art Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">This way they left our workers and patrons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000 was organised the survey was in the press, the special price was “people in our city.”</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination of “artist of the year I was appointed me, that was the end of my peak.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the new times under the old rules is an unpleasant job, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In recent years, it's easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are very different things, you can be popular, but not too much cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works are characterized by an identifiable manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Many of my paintings are hits, which is vividly captured the timeliness and penetration.</seg>
<seg id="39">I have a program of the Russian Museum exhibition “clowns”.</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless categories.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the past, I used to be social, today it is painful and awful.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clowns are all blurred, scanning the tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, to save the world by way of the totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today, people face under clothing, focusing on the external drive, not on the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or maybe he can't shake his hand and spit in his face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the illusion of change will be deleted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Recently-we can see you in the role of urban organ grinder. - cultural city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">And who it should be, if not me?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- And may be commercial art fair?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- At the moment should be commercial, utilitarian art thorough, tactful, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">The disintegration of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Previously, people gathered in groups, La Bohème loved one, free from other people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today, everything is broken at mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not 100 bill, so I liked all of them.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today is a no-brainer, whom he likes.</seg>
<seg id="57">Today, everyone has a cultural hero of its 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- And to Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- To be arrested fans, there had been involved sexually social sphere.</seg>
<seg id="60">And the cultural ground comes 300 people and 10,000 of them coming, and the result is less management, money, everything is failing.</seg>
<seg id="61">To supporters, the main thing is that nobody is fooled and violates what is well established.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I was painting such images, which in one collector hung on the wall together with Falkem and Larionovem.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the images, which people often end up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, people often confuse the concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say: a spiritual culture, the culture of the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture of consumer, it is elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="67">He was a man of the culture of the day before, I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing to accept the money because of drawing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">And I am in favour of such a culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Clive, what is in Petersburg shortage?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- Good experts on culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such a concept: deputy through culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">Not all of them, but we can deal with the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the time of the tsars that wasn't true in all the tsars, perhaps too understand culture, but they understand that there is a need to promote real experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow today are good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">In St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are kept somewhere in a corner, because they need big experts, who rightly appreciate these experts and the state is on the right track.</seg>
<seg id="76">Today's thriving vkusovština.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but differ in that they honestly say that not all the modern art, we accept there are artists who should look for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">What do you think is the Petěrburk?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petěrburk-it is the Capital of Culture, in Moscow's culture much more, there is the right soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our waste is the art of doing poorly.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural scene, but for us it is today writers more than readers, this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are a great many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">There's a layer just weak.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need to make art has become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is being implemented by means of a grant of St. Petersburg</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is not great.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, there are only two of the planet, which is possible to learn, even if only hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">“It's Venus and Mars,” says a senior researcher at the Institute of Astronomy P.K. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But while they are on Mars, better conditions for life on the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="10">Live there is possible only at high altitude or orbiting Venus … in the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Addressing the issue of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already half a century ago were carried out experiments on the plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from the Earth's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was then carried out the insects into orbit — a very small fruit flies Drosophila.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 it was sent into space a quail's eggs, to determine how the developing embryo in weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The output is absolutely normal bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The problem arises with it, that it must find support, they need to stand on their own two feet and start to move,” said the head of the lab Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) Ran Vladimir Syčev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If they can't find the support, the birds are falling out of the chaotic and somersault.</seg>
<seg id="20">After 10 hours in the newly hatched birds to a complete cessation of instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The birds did not respond to light or sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And the problem was that, in four days just died.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Twice we hatched birds, but then we had refused, because it is simply impossible there working with them,” says the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last “miniarcha” with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013, experiments continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">In “biosatelitu Bion” but are only being one sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There has been an experiment with rats, which were broadcast into space already pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="28">In essence, they found nothing.</seg>
<seg id="29">“It was just for biosatelitech, but, again, this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be carried out,” says Vladimir Syčev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing on Earth's cosmic rats born offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">Closer to the problem of reproduction in space, but have so far failed to do.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is a tough task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals at the loss of normal environmental simply cannot realise their sexual instincts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Man, unlike animals, can in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens is abstract thinking and is able to set up a corresponding emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women are flying into space for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The greatest danger threatening Tereshkova's.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman's body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Chalka away and no one on the ground was unable to say whether the last flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether it will be able to deliver a baby after a flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">“But this question has no answer,” says veteran skyrocketing-space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The baby's father was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, was born the son of a second woman-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice and who also worked in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="46">The risk, however, remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only a few astronauts for long years born and grow the health of children.</seg>
<seg id="48">“In addition, it can be dangerous even when the orbital flights,” says astronaut-pilot, a hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia's Valeri Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Humanity must inevitably find new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Hydrolaboratoř CPK is compulsory stage of preparations for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in terms of zero gravity, astronauts acquire skills needed to work in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water simulates weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Even for adults, the water even comfortable, but it's kind of a strange environment for young children is a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between that and the child is averaging 9 months in his mother's journey and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, it's logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, after only two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">“It's a very little for the child's forgotten,” says instructor swimming newborns Marina Aksenovová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness natural state, then for women is more natural, inevitable gravitational attraction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In microgravity is very quickly to the decline of abdominal muscles, muscle pans, declining ability to flesh out the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">We can leave aside, if they work promoters work muscles in childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of the day, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the body's mother would oust the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="62">“What can I say?” asks Valeri Polyakov complex questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If not for the organism gravity, it right to form a skeleton or a set of muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn in orbit, it is not possible to dress like an adult in a suit with a burden, in which they could practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just don't be deprived of what to its development of vitally needed.</seg>
<seg id="67">“If you go to the experiment, which says, “the birth of a child in a foreign environment, bringing the country's disabled person, that would be totally inappropriate to our environment,” says the Commission on Bioethics IBMP wounds Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So births in the universe today is not just a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">Once again, however, the time will come when it will become a reality, and when the issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Chief W: check švarcsystému failed because of politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has in connection with the procurement of good quality supervisors and legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview with the News. com says that the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav ape.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right of his administration-that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing,” says the current situation now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar findings also suggest the joint control of the czech and german controllers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the wrong practice provides access to a so-called “Peter Nečas švarcsystému”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will entrepreneurs bother his check-is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">“The law must not be somehow set, and if something prevents, so even the Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the walk,” she notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, under which compared the legislation on public contracts in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was specifically?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The parallel control, which we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply, it is a matter of european legislation that governs how public contracts to address, is followed by the national legislation, and then also the experience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We're all of this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, showed us a very interesting differences — generally speaking, legislation is for us, maybe even “stronger and better”, but the practice is in certain parameters better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is, then, that it is not enough to create still further and further detailed rules, but a need to devote itself to the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why do you, in fact, this project can help, what will become of it for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One such joint control could contribute to stop efforts to refine and improve laws, reducing limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Cost-effective means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (but does not always mean the lowest price), in order to avoid any enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, by reducing the limit of contracts, it does not need to be achieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps that is the system would take such an amount of “paper” that those who want to look for holes in the system, so they will benefit a lot easier than if the limit was increased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">We're talking about domestic problems in passing legislation on public procurement into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How the system works checks in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is similar to our own office which, or is it set differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities concerned, such as W .'s works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized in much the same way as we do, also has a division, only to form a slightly differently, but in principle, both agencies doing likewise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the powers are to some extent similar, however, that Germany's federal structure, so has the following the courts and at the level of the federal state-that the system is a little different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can control only the federal money for us posed by public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are managed by us and the municipalities, they control the level of federal auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What is there in terms of legislation, so that it is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, without any specific data like comparisons, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but you can certainly say that it is all better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It's not even that they have better controllers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but, again, I don't have such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it should be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, is faced with a wide range of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, it would not be beneficial to cooperate with our office, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In terms of domestic legislation, what your office was an amendment to the law on public procurement, and there are already some of its consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In view of the fact that the duration of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control actions reflected.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we're doing checks, needs to be reckoned with some delays.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We are seeing that, so far, only in the process of preparing the future checks-we started our new tool for “risk detection inefficiencies”, through which we at nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed the is-there are those changes, of course, will show, because it's going to change the limits, the conditions of certain types of competition will be adjusted, and so on and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The approval of this law, so do more for benefits, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem here may be that she “will tighten the rules” and will not be able to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now for the functioning of the previous rules are controlled by a person committed provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programs Regional Council) that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">So has the price law tightening in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">“I don't think this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must not exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a technicality, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how does that leave out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The show, which is not the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother the trader's controls of the so-called “švarcsystému” - and what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must not be somehow set, and if something prevents, so even the Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the walk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You could say: “we will change the law and allow it”, but I can say that we will do, anything like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented-which is right, in order to protect the public.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand it is tragic, as the candidate with the best offer is excluded for formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right of his administration-that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about that, in less than a month that has come to the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It's just one of the more alarmist, we humans like to catch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with the band the TAP TAP from making more fun and what we are saying is that we are the only group in the world, which is able to collect enough positive energy to the end of the world delayed or prevented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December, in addition to organize your unique project three concerts at the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can imagine him closer to readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The national musicale, which we have been planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11: 10 a. m. this morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before December 20 from 21 hours with co-3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will end up at roughly the same time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is within the timeframe for 12 hours before us, the mayan calendar ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally it was about my idea, then we all thought, together with our artists John Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to be together with the public to think about what kind of state once the world pass on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at http://www.e-TAP.com us humans can also support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The TAP TAP, together with other performers also sang the anthem against the end of the world, which is called “the end of the world” repealed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today is very popular on YouTube, is also on the charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, in the very end, so if everything goes and the end of the world will occur.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sing it all artists in all three concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The anthem was a link in a unique live on czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The words to the song he wrote and the role of Jesus in the video plays Tomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl x …</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you come to get them to cooperate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are also working with other figures in the czech cultural scene, in view of the fact that we have a lot of charitable events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We're trying to be heavily involved in these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What can the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The equipment accessible training centre Studeo already six-year exercise in civic associations in TAP Jedlička's Institute for the Handicapped.</seg>
<seg id="27">For students in schools Jedličkova Institute regularly instructors and engaged in activities that they love and care.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the resources to take on the teachers went on their own, trying to get them not to allow this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the constitution in the future, there will be a separate Jedličkova building into which they have with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Each concert will speak several bands and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what you choose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to build a program that appeals to all age groups, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, the TAP TAP, Blitz Bango and Jiri dry.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details at www. kpks. com.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">You are planning a similar “bombastic action” in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, for the first time, we will act on the Prague Spring, so there are certainly make an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year, we would also like to play in the czech national house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I'd like to tie in with the speech in Washington, D.C., and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet he spoke up, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The TAP TAP is, however, a group of disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">How these journeys are mastering logistically and organisationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as bad as it first appears.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members in an electric cart, its trucks have to travel in the baggage compartment, also, of course, carrying large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far it's always handled without problems, CSA and British Airways to us were well prepared, that I wonder how many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, of which we have returned recently, it was no problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to výjezdům abroad can compare how individual differ in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other places where everything works better than us, we in Russia have seen that in the East, everything is still in full at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="48">From Prague to Moscow's very barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric cart moving in the centre of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are no such commonplaces like wheelchair users should get priority in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are civic associations, which tries to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to note that the upgrading and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of people who are affected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, is completely normal, that is, people with severe completely independently moving on to the public can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it's not very common, there was a large number of people with disabilities participated actively in social life, in that we have, in fact, with the TAP TAP bit ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only at a time when we are prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things are going to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong faith.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The band the TAP TAP is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years back what you in 1998 led to build it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I took over as trainer to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who have an interest in something to pay attention to.</seg>
<seg id="60">And having been a musician, playing, among other things, on it, so I, together with my colleague founded zájmový musical circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Now, with the passage of time, as our host Láďa Angelovič, a little bit out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But popularity came up in recent years, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us when we have begun to merge with well-known singers and also to work actively to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">There was us, that the work, which can be seen, in fact, as if they did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions of the European Union, they can afford high-quality teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Is your goal to go with the TAP TAP so high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt the potential that we can do something different.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness is stuffed with things, where one is the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">In a way it is logical, everything new is being received with caution and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">Things that are isolated, there is very little, but I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it is natural.</seg>
<seg id="72">But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people are not suffering from a completely abandoned all beings, which we regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are the people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that when things get people with completely, so it's not a shift for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">This success has helped, too, that you have a strict boss, how many people you call?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do good work, we need to be in many ways an uncompromising and require some discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it is perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their heads in the clouds, and if he finds that he must go on trial twice a week, there is a product and spend a lot of time on the road at concerts, so is the enthusiasm quickly leave.</seg>
<seg id="79">But that's the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the band the TAP TAP 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were in its beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, people are leaving, and they can't be helped.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and desire, has always kept its doors open for us</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The day before the end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p. m.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, at a meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency accepted Poland for the 20th member of the European Space Agency, like the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (for the Czech Republic, which is a full-fledged member of the ESA has 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched an enhanced co-operation with the ESA in 1994, and in the last few years have been involved in a number of projects for the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Flights into space is devoted to the polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Recall, for example, the class A. Šternfelda in Warsaw's astronomical observatory, which 6 December 1933 imagined thoughts of his pioneering work entry into space.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thoughts of a young engineer (born in 1905) left audiences cold and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski said about his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld in 1934, gained entry into space in France of the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and Andre Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a big advocate of Astronomy and Space.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became the world's most famous advocate of aerospace and his contribution was valued by the fact that one of the crater on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 was in Poland built rolling trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and there is even the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for the start-up of the trolley or to its application.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about this handcar are known only from the period of the press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933, the rocket shells began to deal with polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of german troops research was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, in academic journals, discovered a photoelectric the interceptors, which suggested an engineer Rohoziński and in the following year went work Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all the projects of military use of rocket technology gave temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), that all the work is being coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years the activities of its activities to start a war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further work on the space after the war in the polish press thanks to the work of the polish company astronautical (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time there is mention of the company in the November edition of the year 1954 Problemy magazine, in which there are four more comprehensive sections devoted to astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company, which will take up space.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, it was already out of the projects and artificial satellites, it was clear that the space research is a promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the year, 1956, Poland's Astronautics Society (PTA) snažia on entry into the international astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and now in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the following year, the first chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation of astronaut.</seg>
<seg id="30">This feature until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of a highly successful meteorological rockets Rome (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish missile, which has conducted scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of Rome-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with a ceiling of 1,800 metres long, 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">This was later built an improved version of the Rome-1A, and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovské flight tests of two-stage rockets Rome-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 metres long, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Further development of the type you should be able to actual scientific work-rocket Rome-34 should have a ceiling to 14.5 km, and its task of monitoring the height of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962, was suspended for further development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor to the first rocket-type Rome became the rocket meteor-1 emerging from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Developed three types (indicated by a meteor-1A and 1B-of-1C), different sizes of space for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">In a rocket meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0.4 per litre, meteor-1B on volume of 0.34-litre and meteor-1C on volume of non-litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum ceiling for all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The years between 1965 and 1968 was in the institute's development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket meteor-2 should be starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry payloads weighing 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Were subsequently built version of a meteor-H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Still, it is worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of a National Committee COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also under the Intercosmos engaged in research into space aboard a soviet-made satellites and in 1978, polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after Vladimir Remek second interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution prompted a lively public debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly, it would be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world, based on the principle of more unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect, this means that individual economic departments, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict between them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the principle of free trade and free movement of unrestrained private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The influence of the strong prices work (wages) is due to the tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">As such, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in the competition, that “upset” the price of a competitor to tear down a larger share of the market and thereby increase their profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or to buy cheap, or terminated. the result is high unemployment in countries where the cost of labour in comparison with other large economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility, and responsibility for it produced unemployment, are not necessarily social state spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation adds to an absolute unwillingness to Messrs entrepreneurs pay taxes and this is no substitute for economic and social corporate losses in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so widely known that there is no need to give specific figures.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the form of individual economies, a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the welfare of its people, with the aim of attracting foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments are private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was especially affected by the changes in existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">To make its own population is economically by the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's going on, on the other hand, the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, partly by limiting the rights of workers in the field of employment law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are already a number of years public offices of food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to enhance the competitiveness of the german economy is currently in a case that has been properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay the state into the breadline.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the scandal has been published, and, in the case of auxiliary staff of the German Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures virtually all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same state where people are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of the social level either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or languish on starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might one day come private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">There must be, but ask but where does?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it's going to be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or don't come at all, because the chinese, indian, brazilian or Turk Marokánec, or egyptian or african still work for a fraction of the wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It concerns the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theories and media ad nauseam, argues that the state cannot participate in the capital in its own economy, that control of the economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly to insist that the state cannot control interventions to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then there is reason to question whether private equity does not affect, now in control of policy and this nation in its own egoistickém sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is a definite answer yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Evidence of the existence of virtually all-powerful and in all the states of the ubiquitous lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation occurs in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the legislation, which is practically everything reprehensible, but nothing criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds to draw up bills to private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All this does not come from the people of how the Constitution's doctrine of western-style, but from the financially powerful groups preferujících's own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that the liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly coming into the situation, as he describes in his book Appiános crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: “the state had long been in complete meltdown, and authorities are taking possession of violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">For bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and for using stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people went to vote with pre-sold voice” … “decent people on board at all apply, so once was as a result of the failure of the state eight months without consuls”.... “it started to really talk about it, that the only remedy in a bad situation is samovláda and the need for a more energetic man.” while thinking about Appiános Pompey, but he became the Caesar, which changed to take democracy for self-rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion, as well as in Antiche is contemporary society based on reckless preference for their own benefit, regardless of a society-wide interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is not inherently unable to understand and apply the benefit of society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now, as then, the unparalleled decadence elites without any attempts at reform of the profound.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causality onset of fascist and communist regimes must therefore seek in indiscriminate liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">In its current state, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy type considered as a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>

<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition, both on the international and european level, the Ministry of the Interior, the Government of the Czech Republic to continue to find ways to further reduce the welfare of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore the system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is a political and social reforms that will strengthen the participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of the citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the country.</seg>

<seg id="6">I don't want to think about it, who is periodically repeated waves of killing the culprits and victims, who, after all, today's residents of Israel, including self-governing territory was born in the current political situation and the start of the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">My point is to offer readers to peek behind the curtain, look at it, who will primarily serve already 95 years of tension (dating from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts are some of them based on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.</seg>

<seg id="12">We have to admit that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could take place during the lifetime of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among those astronomically rich families singled out one, which could be regarded as the head of octopus (if there was one of them, I don't know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschieldové.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many of them say.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) bought back in the 1990s. the 19th century to stop linking his name with highly criminal acts, in the background, and it has always been the consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth, or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">The shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank should not be conducting or preparing for war (against attacks by Afghanistan's seven countries, after the attack on Iraq that was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi's left with only four, but in the meantime, Russia's central bank subordinated to the russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with this family tried to resist, he died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Central Bank Rothschieldově Bank of America, began during the civil war to issue their own (read the government's) money, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre.</seg>

<seg id="21">Their desire for global power has resulted in years of 1859-1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars Mason High, 33-degree-Albert Pike.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war to remove large royal government units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial mansion in Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population at 0.5-1 billion people (a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: when is the worst call in Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">We should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who after the revolution, fled to the United States, which had been a patron of his regime for several decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the US administration situation offered a positive outcome of the Shah-throw overboard couldn't afford, because it would significantly harm confidence among allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The release of the hostages but in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded the fiasco of an attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Detention of diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations brokered an algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their plight at home sparked a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck's Argo describes one episode in the history of America, which has resulted in a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just prior to the occupation of the embassy of her escaped six employees.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a complex business ended up in the residence of the canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the canadian authorities had managed to get them from Iran, helped the extravagant cover story-went to the canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country at the location for filming the sci-fi epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which was invented by an expert on “exfiltraci” Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">That myth was credible, we wrote about the film project in the specialist magazine, held a press conference, fictional production company should have a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">Details of the operation were long classified, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film is a combination of more specific Affleckův genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, realistically broad political thriller, at the same time, the so-called “right” movie, the story of vydařeného piece, foul play — can be seen as an example of a series of Danny's teammates.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, so changing mood-on the one hand documentation or evidence-ranging sequence of Tehran (titulkové sequence are shown ikonické photographs of events and the manner in which they were the same situation presented in the film-the large differences in it).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there was the scene from CIA headquarters and other institutions-the men in suits are discussing the situation at the table, in the corridors, on the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleckovi remarkably managed to restart his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">Become an object of mockery of the actor became a respected director, as well as his acting has ceased to be a target of a cynical comment.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, after dark Krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller city (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, this is the first Affleckův slide, which take place in režisérově Boston home.</seg>
<seg id="27">A sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics of the director's earlier films place above the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck and it also reflected in argos, where Tehran “plays” Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scene in the movie is unfolding in the streets, while rekonstruování actual events-the opening sequence the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotion and confusion nepřevídatelnosti that ensue when they move out of history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect and his colleagues are in scenes of fabricated (false staff in Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many things in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director has had to deal with the fact that the story told by offering doesn't really in the film the sensational scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully with it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - there's everything so elegantly rises (the scene in which the looming crisis at Tehran airport refused to call in America and chase down the runway looks rather far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">But the weakness of the Argo's ramblings arising from the need to show too many things in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are roles in Hollywood's colleagues are very charming, their figures but he deserved more space and are not in the movie is far from the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleckův movie sort of losing a dramatic move, it's image, which can be monitored with mild interest, to pay tribute to the implementation and retro-style reminiscent of the thrillers of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">But push hard.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of the one still has a way of living history, proof of how far-fetched are images of suffering and all-knowing the secret service, but it will suffice.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The site www. bankovnipoplatky. com, which publishes annual survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">“This led us to the last event when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the management of large european companies,” said Law organizer Patrick Nacher survey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominated the absurd is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights on the unification of premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet while women were in the price of life insurance beneficiary, because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">“Another incredible ideas from the EU may nominate people by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place by the end of February 13,” said Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial EU regulation is needed, as well as mandatory blending of biofuels into the fuel, which as a result of harmful to nature, to ban the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the size of cages for hens, which this year significantly more expensive eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Previously faced criticism as well as a de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or disposal of light bulbs from the sale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The quality of bananas have 14 inches</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The camera often decides under pressure or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (and the Czech Republic now and the threat of a veto promotes the requirements of its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Lobbying interests were also behind it, for example, that the highest quality of bananas in the Union consists of at least 14 cm and may not have “abnormal curvature”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission has said that only harmonises the uniform national standards, which were complicated by trading.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rules on fruit and vegetables for the EU despite the opposition of some states with softened by pointing out that the directive will lead to food waste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate to victory in the poll may be the last year the EU regulation, which must be sold in toy balloons without notice, that is, children younger than 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU's appeal to the U.S. research, in which balloons are among the leading cause of death in children's toys to suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similar restrictions are now paying for children up to 14 years for blowing the carny frkaček.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Quaint ideas are born at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Rather it is absurd and then rule on european officials to anyone who has a formal role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the issue for Greece's use of the name Macedonia and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky. com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire wrote in the polls, some of the above mentioned absurdities even EU regulations on the volume of food supplies to the territory.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks, which may be present in the territory of the Czech Republic in the day of our entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic then crossed, e. g., laid down in the volumes of canned mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organisers of the poll took the idea to pay some countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies at the request of the receiving subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those ideas, however, have emerged in Brussels, but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">“We're handicapováni that we don't have the sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We ask the European Union for reimbursement,” he said in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As an argument, has indicated that he is with us bred a lot of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For that, the Czech Republic has continued to ports, we want the EU to Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The European Commission turned out to the Czech Republic to meet that organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">The subsidy to obtain subsidies offered to municipalities, the Ministry for Regional Development Minister Paul managed by the German (US-DEU), in particular, should go to the drawing up of a request for funding from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU's bizarre regulation are the exception:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Regulation is in the Member States could easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, a more efficient operation and development of the whole of the European Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">More serious is the problem, according to experts, for example, drawing on EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of anything to do with the deepening of european integration, but that was in the budget negotiations led to the Member States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Emotions between Czechs raises that, as well as other countries of the Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to specific indications of their traditional products, which do not always succeed in this fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The czechs are in the six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians uphold the latter name, but domestic rum, whose tradition for us dates back to the 19th century, our producers to rename tuzemák.</seg>
<seg id="36">The naming of rum can carry only products from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of registered products in the EU is in the company of the world-renowned feta cheese and Gorgonzola, marzipan from german Lübeck Parma ham, for example, or have left the biscuit, Pohořelický and třeboňský carp and žatecký hops.</seg>
<seg id="38">The trade mark of the EU are also proud of the product and the wafers.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">The whole time I was told that in the battle for the castle will go according to the outcome of the congressional elections.</seg>

<seg id="13">My goal but not a function, function is a tool, how can carry out his vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's why we need a maximum influence and what the strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is not just that we, as a nation, things in the pub and in front of the tv, but by trampling on everybody who wants to try to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this is added to the media that the man dehonestují and confuse the freedom of speech, the freedom to lie.</seg>

<seg id="21">As president, but you don't have that kind of authority, and the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How are you going to solve?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I was a citizen lobbied for it to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politics, when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, is rejected, and citizens' lives.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nestraník have far greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My preference is that without a partisan categorization of dogmas and you can take something that is for our country, the best from each side and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You think you're more of a man of right-wing or left-wing?</seg>

<seg id="41">I don't have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Persuading politicians, journalists and members of the public and to try to get them on your side to pull it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If he was elected president, there is no problem hold televised live, where I will ask the parliamentary parties to enact substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.</seg>

<seg id="56">I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now it's a coin toss.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people who work for the elections and those who went to elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we just two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People navolili Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="60">Still, I'm going to fight for your vision, such as for the direct election of mayors or generals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Are you considering establishing his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I still think about it, because I don't have time to check the net past any potential Party guy, and I don't have the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You don't have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">Talking about financial returns, what's yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Private property is about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague's land roughly $25 million, an apartment for ten million, another home for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for $3.5 million and Skoda superb per million, and then I've got a few million in the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally, Aston Martin, because it was my boy's dream-I've always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, he was courteous to women and, at the same time, he fought against the wickedness and excesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Aston Martin, you have the assets for 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change, but their own money into it too much to give you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">It will get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign, I rushed for 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I don't have any sponsors, testifies to the fact that on my program might not be such an interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I don't have an obligation to pay part of their campaign.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign I basically cover what I receive senátorský salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But it would, for example, couldn't pay nevyžil son english school, which costs 30 thousand per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So, you will continue to do business, to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Didn't you say that these activities utlumíte?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it has nothing to do with the amount of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, their activity was partly allayed.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the travel agent in the spring will become my representative.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like us to be Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How many of you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure will occur only in his mind — for example, Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books-2 pictures</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">“The building seems to me to be cheerful, looks like a futuristic. finally, it is once again to see something interesting,” says Lisette Verhaig, which goes over the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, it techniques in the Middle large business, says: “of course, the house is nice.”</seg>
<seg id="4">However, I wonder, why do we still need a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">None of those libraries in the old-style already voluntarily and nobody goes, or is it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, neighborhood in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, is holding a special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">This community of 80,000 people, the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To this silly situation resolved, died a few years ago, the decision to contribute to a general education and build seven nicely painted reinforced thumbnail fictional bridges, which are shown on euro notes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of educational offensive but not staggering.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so town officials recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we have to have a library.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas of Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely courageous Column graphs and the issuer of humorous, often even cynical buildings, the thing with the usual calm and negotiations on competition in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the Commission still stunned, looking around and shrugs, piling up bold Maas their gifts, according to the size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words “Dear urban community!”</seg>
<seg id="14">This, then, is my proposal to the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million against.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of revitalizačního project, which also entails an underground parking lot, a supermarket, post office and several adjoining residential and rank-and-file home with a total of 50 homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, was a mountain of books honored second place “best Library of NL 2012”.</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Small-town, which still could offer more than post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly town hall, whose white facade would rather expect dairies, is due to the richer on a bit of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, above all, it is now the first public Spijkenisse cultural construction in the history of their existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A long way to book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: reading the Eldorado under glass on the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">By means of the mountains while riding the elevator, but the actual space and reading passions up until the close control of topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">From all sides of the glass-walled interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And all the books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">“Normally stands the bookshelves along the front and center is a dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have the classic spatial configuration built upside down and space for the reader, extending from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountains of books is cleverly exploited: Wednesday's offices, online library, chess club, eco-centre and the front-of-the-art.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special comfort are black shelves for books that were once lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The appearance of the structure, and the smell is alien to him.</seg>
<seg id="33">The new building material to shake their heads and even the bitterest architects and engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the municipality of Spijkenisse, to question the magazine standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a base by the roots of a millimetre of synthetic material.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and effective.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin fabric lasts one or two seasons, and then be ready to blow up in a bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">The library was fleece-for the first time in such a quantity-pressed down on the boards of four inches.</seg>
<seg id="40">The heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic shut) turns in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps to get to the top.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the nearly 500 metres of the long journey will be in a literary cafe rewarded not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the dutch croquettes and ficus trees in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">Those responsible for the atmosphere, but mainly on the right humidity in the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“I don't believe that, but this house is, in spite of the many glass desktops a project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">The heating and cooling the Earth's heat.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books is under glass, the sun shines in a short time, and even on sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad glued wooden-beams, which stands across the glass facade, serves as a shield and picks up a large portion of solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">With the rest of the fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of it industry, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also a teacher of traditional chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde who Boekenberg even referred to as “long-awaited soul” Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: each of the city's population was a few weeks ago, was not invited to the opening to devote one book from his personal funds.</seg>
<seg id="55">So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently stands at 70,000 units.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has been proven.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are completely filled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">“There is nothing worse than a half-full library,” says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">“I think that, thanks to our invitation, now has a new home every inhabitant of a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it was just for show.</seg>
<seg id="62">It is MVRDV worked in the discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">No matter how young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">That, after all, is the starting point for an identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: “the Germans must play a greater role.”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the decision-making process for the adoption of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa that Berlin teeters on the edge of a narrow diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: Germany earlier this week first signaled that it would vote against the proposal to the palestinian observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel is prudent.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think that he will not support the american position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence — without, of course, would be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">That ultimately put NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take on major international issues is a clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of policy, which was, in a manner of speaking, orchestrated by the US, in the direction of the german foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is made more difficult by the fact that the Europeans have a coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are, therefore, between the two lines.</seg>
<seg id="18">They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think of himself in his role until settling in, but they are on the way to a more “normal” foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">In foreign policy, as in France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly does “normal” foreign policy from the german point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Shows readiness to take in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the U.S. or european partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that Germany's foreign policy is not motivated by economic policy, so the export and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other nations, and because Germany has to protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Should the economic interests of the impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict, and a vote in the United Nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a big market in the Middle East, particularly in states around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">It must, therefore, be careful not to discourage the public, but not the elite in the arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I wouldn't want it but not to ascribe too much importance, it is completely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it certainly plays a significant role in the deliberations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Damaged relations with the US, Germany, when Germany was in the case of two important decisions abstentions, for example, at the time of the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe, and even in the US, has a lot of sympathy for Germany's stance.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I don't think it was as dramatic as a breakthrough on the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Let's hope it's Germany even gain some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It signals that must be regarded as an international player and its interests have to be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different views on the palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are between the US and many european nations' differences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences exist in the wake of America's internal policies.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has probably had a great deal of sympathy for the european position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But as a result of the political situation in this position, of course, carry out publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that differences in opinions really aren't so great, as they always seem to.</seg>
<seg id="43">When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama isn't much impressed with Netanyahu's policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is difficult for Germany to align its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and to the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans, of course, would be a little bit easier, if there was a coherent and united european policy, which is currently not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore cannot be part of a wider line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is just what they do with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany would take a leading role in the future and will push Europe toward the european position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It has always been a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play an independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as a major international player? he ever wants to take the lead?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still used, it's still painful, and for this country is, for obvious reasons, is still hard to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, when we look at the crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role, created the post of mood.</seg>
<seg id="57">It does not facilitate the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is, in fact, an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and views, and that is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of the US in european politics now has steadily declined, but the EU this vacuum currently do not otherwise. who's left?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans would just have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they don't, they feel uncomfortable and it makes them even more neoblíbenějšími-c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">“The protection of brands” in China: when are the Puma and Armani suddenly chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the designation, which is completely officially registered in China, but the company has nothing to do with the original.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, enjoys protection as long as it is the real owners get an indictment marks.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then, it is unclear whether they have rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">“For foreigners, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect its brand in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of copyright in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week, lands on my desk in the new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Counterfeiters have had a few letters, so that they can apply for their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">From Gucci, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada, instead they register the Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, they are legally copied and german companies, like sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens the cabinet's trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14 September 2010 was left one chinese firm to protect brand Zegna DF Puma. artificial name parazituje even at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in copying and violations of intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities are multistory department stores, which are almost exclusively sell counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochovy cases are but another. on behalf of their clients is opposed to chinese firms have received from the trademark office is officially a right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The chinese call it “Bang Mingpai” tag attached.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is in line with the word “Bang Dakuan”.</seg>
<seg id="19">That meant women who hunt rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">“That is to the detriment of business, we have to combat it,” invites Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">“The mark is diluted, monopoly disappears, the damage to the image of it is enormous.”</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries running into the millions, particularly in expensive sample products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to data from the company's market research for CLSA China is a $15 billion per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="25">The deletion of dubious records in the record labels, however, may be difficult to achieve, and it costs money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Management can stretch for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells the story of cases in which the court rejected the claim, because the contested name has become after a long period of “market reality”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When the plaintiff misfortune plagiátorovi still must pay for damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cases are also affecting the graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company, which recently took over the german manufacturer of pumps on the cement mixture Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the star of the Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Geely, the company that bought Volvo, originally used the blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. the dispute was settled, geely had to change the logo.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers of Hong Kong and Singapore, who had known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">A 2.3 grade point Office CTMO recognizes that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of staff and premises.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year, the supposedly “the working process returned from an emergency situation to normal”.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of unprocessed an opposition fell 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Celebrated, 57,000 of these cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still waiting for office still 81 500 complaints pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To do something about it is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is the case in China, often it's an impressive number.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year it was CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is nearly one-third more than the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's a record, and it means that China for the tenth time, leads the list of new applications throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This also applies to a number of all existing trade marks, there are a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Basically, this means that each on the average cost of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Start against this dispute is worth several times, as shown in the case of german family business acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="49">This group has more than seven years of fighting against chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans had achieved that was cancelled by the illegal manufacture of imitovaných automobile parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">But a counterfeiter secured China's rights to the brand will continue to compete.</seg>
<seg id="52">That alone would have failed, because in Germany cannot be protected by name, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management company's acquisition of Chemical specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">A 2.3 grade point Office CTMO then also questioned the Munich firm rejected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In two other instances, while the acquisition of rights, but the claim in the dispute is fighting continues to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It must be awful to watch</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praised the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: “the procedure is extremely expensive and it takes a lot of time, money and the nerves.”</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs cannot be quantified. in the archives of the company had to even see a hundred years old, to produce the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago the company's acquisition of the opposing party in vain offered “high six figures in the euro” in order to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">“You can see what it means to us,” says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will hit Europe, too.</seg>
<seg id="63">And in any case, when there imitators will ensure unprotected brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">One chinese manufacturer in Germany, for example, wanted to sign the acquisition for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of business, the group gave up a long time ago, it was able to avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">“We need to be very careful,” says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and his lawyer Pattloch advises german companies that were in the trade with China is very cautious.</seg>
<seg id="68">Not enough to rely on international law známková. foreigners would rather have “everything that in any way is worth protecting, submitted in China”, says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the company compete in the last act of the drama of the mark, then I will have to pay the license fees for its own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or will we be in contentious segment pushed out of the market.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial sleep to syphilis, chlamydia and blue balls (GONORRHOEA).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent sleep are the HIV virus, human papillomaviruses, cold glandis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crabs and parasitic mite belong to sleep.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to a group of the most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and blue balls can be found mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between the men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often, Chlamydia infection trichomonády, thrush (mold), blue balls and human papillomaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is between heterosexual adults in our extended relatively few, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV is accounted for by this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among adolescents, Chlamydia infections occur far more frequently than other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the survey, three-fourths of all infections involving young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, between juveniles often human papillomaviruses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As the number of infections has evolved?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of people infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute, from 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled, to $3698 disease in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of people newly infected with HIV every year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011, around 700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is roughly one-tenth of less than a year earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What signs point to venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, the difficulty in urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain and tenderness or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, does not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will therefore nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">The danger of the disease can reduce the use of condoms, however, do not offer 100 percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Because the perpetrator of the sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted infections and partly from impurities and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis can cure most sleep and prevent long-term consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, honorářům, which earns choir singing throughout Germany, to collect some of the money.</seg>
<seg id="62">“We are already in the Esitjeni sent around 200 000 euros,” says the group's Annette Lennartz.</seg>
<seg id="63">The money from Germany manages in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, self-confident woman who can impose.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is also about to orphaned children find shelter, for example, some of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo, in the language of the Zulu says old women are the backbone of a village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them were even 14 orphans, giving them a roof over his head and taking care of children to appear every day on time in uniform to school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Children who don't have to go to the shelter Khanyisile, a lone woman paid by society as well as two cooks on a daily basis by cooking for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">“Voices for Africa,” the US-based school sewing, put two henhouses and together with american health organisations dogs do that many people in the village had to test for HIV.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is not granted. even if there is a disease throughout the country so obvious, all of it is silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king's 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has nothing to do with sexuality.”</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually, oddly enough in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch, King Mswati III of black Africa, is known for his lifestyle too.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This state-approved way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus in recent decades and spread rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But even many migrant workers who were carrying the virus across the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that condoms are not on every street corner for free, “but no one is being used.</seg>
<seg id="78">Culture is different-unprotected intercourse.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To at least some support cultural exchange, traveling chorus Imbongi once every two or three years, after South Africa and singing songs full of grief, combativeness, confidence in the future and the self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the continent are known from the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white people who sing songs in the speech of blacks — such a measure not only brings humor and joy, but also has already elicited tears from many wild border troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit children, over whom they have patronage.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even if this village barely can be found on maps in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than familiar.</seg>
<seg id="83">“Go to Esitjeni, there is light,” say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And if you go back to Heidelberg, who is here as the crow flies 8733 kilometer dupajícím singers in rehearsal at Bergheimer 93, you see that light shines here as well.</seg>

<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror optical telescopes still larger — and the broker, are deepening.</seg>

<seg id="58">The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, saving costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Still, the average is about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of low-priced fashion design: a telescope is secured hákovadlem communication angle, which limited his mobility.</seg>

<seg id="66">In “the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (decline) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence-can help every owner of a computer, which would make it available to its computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the point of view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">There's Very Large Telescope-and a credit to her name.</seg>
<seg id="69">The telescope, with a total of four mirrors can shine a light through the mid-infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="84">The primary mirror of space-based infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 feet.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope is looking for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that there is ice on the south pole of the Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="87">For that, however, there are no reliable data, since Messenger circling the planet's far closer to the North Pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The radar measurements showed for several decades that Mercury is on ice.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the probe Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first that revolves around Mercury, scientists have now assured.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: most foul-smelling fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">It could be the secret of success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a few overripe cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put it in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you can smell the stench of paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I was in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a beautiful view of snow-and the pervasive stench hangs in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is salty fermented trout in the water for up to a year, depending on how much you want to fish stank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As night falls, and it gets cold, starting with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet in a festival devoted to this, as they say, preferably nejpodmanivějšímu eat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">“You eat it raw and then it shall zapijete drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called “Rakfisk General”, which is responsible for the course of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us, people eat little cubes of fish with a large quantities of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“Some people are better than rakfisk aquavit,” says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The beverage can block out the stench.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few bits and pieces I'll try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad-it's like a piece of sushi, which has been on a long journey by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different time in Norway, poverty, and because no refrigerator, fish in the autumn dipped into airtight barrels of water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and eat-senses are undoubtedly blunt alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation ago, there were thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country and looking for work, and they emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly — more than 13% of immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive system of care.</seg>
<seg id="22">The swedish people, old rival, which was not very long ago, much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, albeit fairly reek of the past.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the more expensive dishes on the market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even when everything is expensive — a small glass of beer or a sandwich you comes to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is the world's reports often does-and it seems that most people like it that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The name of Anders Breivik, racist, right-wing extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, there are people still cite with reluctance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, it is called a “shooting incident on 22 July.”</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians can hardly believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Behind the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the beginning of the 1970s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">“But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,” says at the plate with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and startling blue eyes is a prototype of the Nordic welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as you say, thoughtful people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, as well as most of the english people here, it is absolutely clear.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nepředvádíme is, we don't like grandstanding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway disposes of its oil wealth very carefully — except for a small percentage of the most money from this sector are invested in a special fund for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw money they did not have, the Norwegians were on their purse strings tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">“While we're skiing in winter and summer hiking, we're happy,” says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">“And eat rakfisk,” she adds with a carefree laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Standing in the snow in front of something to eat-rakfisku already had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">The elk burger is something else, and it's nice juicy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening's smelly fish again here.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, where I live, is one of the many places where he made rakfisk for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather to smell the most demanding fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have a live television coverage, in which a moderator and a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like a singing contest Eurovision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“What you've got to score the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">“This is our scoring Håvard.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There was applause and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="48">The man fell from the chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Traffic in Mexico City is currently in a particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, have been erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the capital city, causing chaos on the roads.</seg>

<seg id="6">On Saturday, the new president of Mexico's Enrique Nieto Pen will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Faced with a tough task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico was at the time of the outgoing presidency, Felipe Calderon prospered economically, the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already taken a victim of an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">“My government has a strong commitment to the mexican people in the reduction in violence,” the president said Pen Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Proposing a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he shook hands with the american president, to Pen Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Views on a new leader are different in his old home, populous and vast state surrounding the capital city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Direct man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo back on it in a good way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Citizens were attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">The city can now travel on one of the new motorways, which left Pen Nieto build. these highways are a huge improvement from a leaky and rough roads, which had been previously.</seg>
<seg id="17">The board with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the issue of climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“We expect that it will lead to a real and lasting change,” says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of a party president Pen Nieta, the institutionalized Revolution (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Particularly interesting and we hope for real change in the area of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 of uninterrupted years in power was a party, the PRI, ousted Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">MP Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the presidential palace, Los Pinos, intra-party from for Enrique Pen Nieta many expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the opposition is refusing to comment about the new president as a man of no substantive content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It's a very straightforward man, very preoccupied with excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state, this is the impression, former governor of many people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad hold, cannot be a contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo clearer.</seg>
<seg id="27">Tucked away under a motorway overpasses in much like the suburbs of Mexico City.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Only in the last two years, the wild places beside the huge waste dumps littered with dozens of bodies of murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">At a time when he was governor, Nieto Pen in the State of Mexico killed more than 1,000 women, which is much more than the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez — a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the best case, critics of the Pen Nieta say that during his term in office has failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">And, in the worst case, his leadership accused of closing one's eyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete house, typical of a run-down neighborhood, me Irinea Buendia shows photographs of their dead daughter's Mariana Islands Luna and crying.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of Marian committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her family, however, believed that she was murdered by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">“When I arrived at the house, so it looked as if her body had been washed away,” recalls Mrs Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs of the strikes and has already begun a posthumous stiffness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">It tells the story of how her mother, Marian looking down from a picture on the wall, next to the cross, which is a single word: “Justice”.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, this is, as they say in the family, exactly what they have been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">State authorities to treat me as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want to simply accept what they say, and that's that.</seg>
<seg id="43">“But it can't be right, when there were so many errors and omissions,” he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">My mexican-american identity crisis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities that are out there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them through difficult times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the last trip to Mexico City, I barely made his way through the crowd and I came into the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Arrow pointing to one of the two lines: one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”) and the other for “Extranjeros” (“foreigners”).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and all my life I have been called “Mexican.”</seg>
<seg id="9">It's ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called “irish” and “my friends in New York call themselves as “Italy”.</seg>
<seg id="10">So later I ended up in the mexican American.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I don't have the vocabulary of native speakers and I can't get rid of an american accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out my american passport and stood in line for “Extranjeros”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I've been thinking about the moment when this week's newly elected Mexican President Enrique Nieto Pen visited in the White House of President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were the issues that are discussed, as the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pen Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the likelihood that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada, and to create a north american trading bloc similar to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pen Nieto has promised that he will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though he did not provide any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relationship with the United States is a complicated and full of hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons over half of Mexico's territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who thinks in the range of centuries, no minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So a minute after Representative of the United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the press and among the elite of the complaints about how Americans would encroach on the sovereignty of its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And children Montezumy walks on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet there is a real challenge for Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million mexican-Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are many.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people of the country offers possibilities, and others who don't.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than it would appear, this person fit the profile-dark-skinned, poor education, come from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not against Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though we are living the american dream, we go to good schools, and we've got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the american dream, not Mexico's.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be vague, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is, in their view, only to fail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico have failed, so it never left.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we have now found no imprisoned for silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but despite the lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that among Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is tension, because Mexicans more means of who they are, and mexican-Americans resent it.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And, at the same time, many mexican Americans, you know, feel like part of one.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to the mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">To obtain the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in either.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we are seen as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we are considered the Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And that relations even more complicated, they want to get some mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, reuniting with the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as a makeshift “ambassadors” and represented Mexico's interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our american colleagues, how great is visiting the country and push for political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Well.</seg>
<seg id="56">Therefore, this does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And thanks to the income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are certain that this is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It's only fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how acted with Mexico before a century and a half ago, we must accept the fact that some mexican-Americans still feel indignation for the way in which he has been treated with their families in substantially closer to the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we're more “Mexicans” than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles, the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be a basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is futile.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, it was amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza, near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even when it seems that Israelis and Palestinians are stranded in its ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, they are caught up in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe it will make their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither won nor lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems that currently there is much reason for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire reached 21. last November, the fight for this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules in Gaza since 2007, will argue that forcing the Israelis to retreat, while Gaza has suffered defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million residents of Gaza, in one of the most pitiful and corners of the planet's most populous, with Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its ardent rivals from Fatah, the more moderate palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well conclude that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">Islamists throughout the arab world have gained more influence, so that Hamas has a powerful and wealthy friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, revived regional power, which was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined on the side of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering people from Hamas, they say that the islamic crescent moon circles around Israel, to the north of Lebanon, which is ruled by a party / militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas' s allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on the southern flank Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous arab country, and the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled Egypt in 30 years, until his fall in 2011, he didn't have time to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">Conversely, the Brotherhood's cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomacy with Hamas may occur as a player who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Instead, israeli hardliners reached opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms were imposed on Hamas back into the box.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven their worth and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israelis can sleep better — for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, America is as hard as always. many european countries also to accuse Hamas of starting the latest round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And, most importantly, Israel had flourished, particularly under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, that the peace process largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, it was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which extends into the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a palestinian state, and protects the jewish settlements, which are still growing despite its illegality in front of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party is at the beginning of the campaign for local elections to be held on January 22, teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they were really ruled on the West Bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, like their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if we hold them to the wall and hit them when they poke their heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners would win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even though the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israel's defense spending, higher than spending all his four arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps new arab governments to recover its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, it is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis also have a situation should look in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination is a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day in areas occupied by Israel explode-as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Currently in the jewish state repression weaken democracy and demographics of this situation even worse, as the arab population continues to grow.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attacks against Gaza are held every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is what makes reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states, where Israel referred to the territory for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside, at least for a little more influence on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar must commit to stopping the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever before to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state, based on the 1967 borders, with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs from outside must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be for the creation of a palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer virtual statehood at the United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its share of how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In his first term, has failed to show its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House, appears to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia, the entry into force of the law on cigarette packs ugly</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The shabby green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are illustrated warning for smokers and diseased parts of the body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Entry into force of the australian laws on bad packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors brands have replaced ordinary olive green boxes with a gruesome pictures of diseased parts of the body and the views of children and infants sick as a result of their parents' smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the various health warnings and images are compulsory from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The australian federal government maintains that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.</seg>
<seg id="7">He relies on studies that show that when people start smoking at the age of 26 years, is 99% chance that never start smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“Even in very young children, you can see that it understands the message that the tobacco companies try to jointly with their product to sell,” says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting a study which, for example, have shown that children joining the crown in the logo with the idea of it being a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies argued that the law will increase trading on the black market, which in turn will lead to cheaper and more abundant cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">“As a result of this legislation is to have serious unintended consequences,” says Scott of the company's british American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others argue that the laws have increased their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha of company Zico import (Ltd, small family businesses, said that the demand for cigarette packaging of silicon used to mask the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the company's british American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost his appeal on the laws of Australia's Supreme Court, has increased from almost zero sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that company Zico has sold nearly 6,000 pieces of wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is, for us, a good deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a possible hitch experts argue the popularity of social media in that demographic group, which focuses on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a number of australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that the majority of dealers hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the Tobacco Marketing moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.</seg>
<seg id="21">“If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this small space for the promotion of your products, is for you online space a place where you want to be,” says Kim Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Ms. Freeman has recorded an increase in the brands on social networking sites, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by John “average”.</seg>
<seg id="23">We must ask ourselves, it's just a private citizen, who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and had this job and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the sector has focused on how to deal with the new rules, than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new rules-country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly.</seg>
<seg id="26">The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek said the government had held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country in 2001 introduced a mandatory warning pictures.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The stricter laws are Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia is resisting.</seg>
<seg id="32">Pictures of me they have no effect.</seg>
<seg id="33">Simply ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">“You just pull out a cigarette and put back in the box,” says Victor El Hage to buy boxes of photographs of the tumor in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, there is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly had spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems, and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I won't lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iphone (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on child development is increasingly coming to praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that for us (and our children) is good, sometimes bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has forced the brain go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And whereas most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have the chance to enjoy the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Therefore, we should support the boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will come back to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as Peter Toohey, a professor of greek and roman history at Canada's University of Calgary, who is the author of “Boredom: a lively history (the history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“In fact, has a long history of boredom,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii was found the latin inscription on boredom, dating from the first century AD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in a variety of ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After watching the research literature and demonstration of the thoughts of the target group of about 100 people, a professor of Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience “I wanted to do something that would have satisfied me, but I wasn't capable of it.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom from apathy distinguishes it, that person is involved, but she would like to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that, in the case of apathy, there is no compulsion to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that the core of boredom is a “distortion of the process, the attention in a bad mood and feeling slowly running out of time.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can remind a lot of depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem within ourselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes I think we are bored, when we have trouble concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study “the Unengaged Mind: defining Boredom in terms of attention”, which was published in September in the journal perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article in a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard loud and related television programme in the next room, others heard it so low that it barely noticed, while a third group didn't hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard a television programme, reported more boredom than the other two groups — had trouble concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed to the problem of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult task or a lively, can lead to boredom of distraction, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, “as it is finding things wrong on the factory line, distracting music can help with that, to be bored.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, “we know now that the twisting and drawing, which is often regarded as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">“Research shows that children who are allowed to stir, with more to learn and keep more information than those who are forced to sit on it,” said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All we have ever experienced boredom-delay my flight, the loud speaker, particularly lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">For help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s, developed the “scale of susceptibility to nudění” (Boredom Proneness Scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale covers issues such as: “a lot of the things that I have to do is repeating itself and is monotonous,” and “I've got so many interests, that I don't have time to do it all.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using these scales, scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Teenagers are, however, generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times daily contact with almost 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of adolescents who reported that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he said that he knows that “adolescence is the heyday of boredom”, which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people are not being given a lot of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, back to my original question: “is good for you boring?”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo an absurd physical risks, playing games or take advantage of addictive substances as a way to relieve it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed merger between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">“Boring is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NY.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain is always the best thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you were getting bored and use the energy to play the instrument and cooking, you'll be happy to do it.</seg>
<seg id="51">If, however, you are watching tv, do you feel good just for a moment, not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you won't get bored, but learn how to attach itself or self-drive, said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And “this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child will learn not only how to attach itself, but gains more self-control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But nor would it shouldn't be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our goal should rather be feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant chatter of the business and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">“We are accusing it of needs is more boring, but boring is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">What people really are looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy leisure time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">“In an environment in which we constantly přestimulovaní,” he said, “it's hard to find ways to amuse ourselves, as the noise shuts down.”</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado, there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and football player from the southeast Colorado, are facing criminal charges for something that will soon be in the state's legal-for the possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which was used to her smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco said, that a September day with a couple of friends in Lamaru, on the plains, near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After police found marijuana in the car, it was Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use, petty crimes, for which there is a penalty for every $100-and he has been set for the court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“They treated us like criminals,” said Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after, Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends answer hundreds of smaller drug cases on the spot rather than on the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana is already here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures, repealed.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Police Department to stop blaming the adult at the age of 21 years of age and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in conservative districts of Colorado declared that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, a number of cities from the Denver suburbs toward the western mountains voted to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">“This business is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in the town of it, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The heads of the gossip and regulators in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="14">And they are looking for guidance on how to set up the licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale of-all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use, and now a recreation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“Colorado has a regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Mr Smith said, no place or system cannot do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">“There is no real precedent for us to follow,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, the so-called I-502, effective from December 6, which also leaves the vacuum, in which there will be a national licensing system, but legal possession of it.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are complex mechanical issues during this period must be resolved, such as how to balance the State's “responsible approach” to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">“There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, and particularly in the metropolitan areas of Seattle,” said Ben Livingstone, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently-based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November sent police chief Oates of the city it his officers e-mail, in which he announced that the city would no longer prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that the police “with immediate effect” to stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The chief Oates said that the police will promote the city's laws regulating growers of medical marijuana, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck stricter.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way of pushing for users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">“Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses, crimes at the time they occurred,” said Mr. Buck, in its statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction has been complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a joint initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand junction, the largest city in the district were adults have been charged for possession of small amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">The district attorney, Peter Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all pending cases of possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">“I don't think that I'm going to lose my time continuing to enforce the law until it is changed,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For the local prosecutors' s “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organisation for the reform of laws relating to marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">“We spent so much of his life chasing people that still cannot actually accept that it's legal,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states that a small quantity of marijuana as opposed to alcohol, are Colorado and Washington on a path to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for regularised sales and at the same time also anxiously waiting for guidance from the federal government, which is still in the plan regarding the sale and cultivation of cannabis for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Proponents of the legalization of marijuana, hope that the Ministry of Justice to cave in.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the arrest of several sellers of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use it to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While drug-enforcement agents are not likely to break down the door to catch a small bag, is likely to oppose allowing the state-controlled business with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on drugs policy administration of President Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several Colorado cities does not wait for the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even if it is going to continue for about a year before we will be able to open any trade.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week the city of Montrose in the western part of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">“We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone will license and then we have a federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We look at it, what they voted for a municipality, compared to what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="47">There are a lot of questions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to step down from Oxford, because I'm a conservative.”</seg>
<seg id="2">His views are accused only of today's college students.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't remember ever dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">As my father, and my older brother, studied at the university, that I think is the world's largest seat of learning, modern ovíněné greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet, at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks of starting at Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases and stormed into the first scandal of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke down and wept.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave up because I had opposed the love of students in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A.N. Wilson playfully said that I left, because I was forced to drink from chipped mugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less comical.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran out.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.</seg>
<seg id="14">I have been persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of alleged enlightenment that was as bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supporter of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You may ask why bring this up until now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because, quite simply, that the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students right-of-center suffers from this kind of persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of such students sought the protection of equal rights to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the association's younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, argues that because of their political views are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and they made clear that they were not welcome”.</seg>
<seg id="19">Called for a position in the university's Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views are free to communicate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation didn't help either recently referred to two BBC television documentary entitled “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (wonderland: young, smart and right-wing) about student politics, which conservatives describe as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">The program was introduced to graduate Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University-OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and should stick with a silver head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities conservative students say that's because of the introduction of higher tuition fees is treated as a “scapegoat”.</seg>
<seg id="23">A 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association nottinghamské University), said Sunday's newspaper, that “left-wing influence in universities is growing.</seg>
<seg id="24">People believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without having us all together.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">20-year old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is “embarrassing”, while the 19-year-old elected President OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that the approach of JCR vis-a - vis the people the right-of-center worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">“It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During its first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.</seg>
<seg id="28">I came in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hatred of the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.</seg>
<seg id="30">A year before the university voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree to the former student, Margaret Thatcher, due to cuts in funding for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">From the atmosphere, even the stalinists shaking with fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">During the first few days in the opening week, when new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which should have come.</seg>
<seg id="33">I discovered that not only professors tacitly approving the needling of conservative students, but with gusto, are also participating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In the wood-lined classroom led the policy of mining strikes, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="35">My first lecture on the french translation of the text from the 18th century to the english language and for what happened, I wasn't ready.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”</seg>
<seg id="37">It's hard enough.</seg>
<seg id="38">Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a Slice dough, was a lot of bilious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">“Thatcherovci refuse to learn to speak french, or simply stupid?” he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students were sniggering.</seg>
<seg id="41">Tears in my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">“I suggest in their spare time took some basic lessons in French, so if you're not too busy to social issues,” said Professor Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Shocked, I returned to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">At a dinner in school, I was sitting alone, when I felt a tap on his shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was the second year student named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">“I know who you are,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it's true.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you, it will be even worse.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the conservative first years pretending to be Labour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later in a local pub I cravenly tried to pretend otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick has proved a failure.</seg>
<seg id="54">First-year student of philosophy, politics and economics (ironic) went to Eton, he said: “you are the daughter of fascist pig.”</seg>
<seg id="55">You are infected.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students with him notovali.</seg>
<seg id="57">It was a vicious, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">“How conservatives love?” asked one.</seg>
<seg id="59">Hitting each other, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt so as to feel homosexuals in front of liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">I could ever lead a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">I would have had to meet with like-minded people just after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">I would have to be converted into labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years before me have developed a purgatory ignorance and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only openly conservative professor, Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was in my school.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not only was hated for it, that is a conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy and one of those who write her speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">Almost wasn't there.</seg>

<seg id="85">Even though I was inside blush with shame, I admitted to me that parents “brainwashed” and I called them “old fogies”.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me a wimp usmrkaným.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no 18letá girl or boy should not be in an educational institution subject to such intimidation and virulence.</seg>
<seg id="95">Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only had 14 conservative prime ministers, but who also has, to date, hiding behind the undeserved reputation as the place with the equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="4">This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners, who earn their living from the conquest of the sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of this, every day fárat until the bottom of the crater, where escape the sulfur gases from the interior of the country and on contact with air passes into a solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After tough large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, takes them on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets of steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it's just 250 metres, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes to rise tortoise pace up, because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected its steps to neuklouzli and fall into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any misstep might cost him his life, how it happened one french turistce, years before they collapsed from the rocks Kawah Ijen.</seg>

<seg id="11">This is a firm PT friend Ngrimbi, which in this volcano has benefited from 1960 and never pay their workers more than 662 indonesian rupees (five cents) for a kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in the day-to-day life and is used for the production of matches, amusing, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">“Because they are commonly worn by 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million) in any way,” says us anto, who usually makes three trips a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way it takes three hours, and at the end of it is destroyed, but he can then earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 million) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even when it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what he earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The daily wage of miners here is very high. for example, the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees ($1.2 million) per day and salary in a fortnight's time is two million rupees (167 million),” explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 million) a day, and the work was so severe, but anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for good reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulphur: “I'm married with a young girl from Bali, which is Hindu, and I took her to Java, to convert to Islam.”</seg>

<seg id="24">Shares of dirty wooden hut with other carriers and every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur night keeps coming out and its distinctive yellow color varies in blue and glow in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the darkness fárá anto into the crater and illuminates the way a small lamp, which is attached to the helmet and himself for their money bought.</seg>

<seg id="28">He did not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 million) from a surcharge on photography, which, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees ($1.2 million) relating to the natural park from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">“This work is for cattle, and not for the people,” says Madrusin, a 42-year old carrier, who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that he would work “as long as possible”, because he needs money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="10">It's the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the world's worst in our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject which we have to touch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the Government has decided to try a lot of things like extend perfumes with pheromones or organize a cognitive functions.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why not do the most creative thing, such as the composition of the rap, in order to resolve this problem.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The who's taken too lightly, it is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">A year spent 1 USD 300 to encourage people to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The government's package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars for a child, extending maternity leave and the allocation of the financial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">All these measures, but had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technologies in south-east Asia, also known as conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the distribution of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time the birth rate has exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a restoration of peace, in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why, in fact, Singapurci have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Mingová, Director of the marriage and the family of the National Authority for the population, says that it is because of “better education” and “a wide range of career opportunities.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">“The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it's not only the marriage and the family,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. the result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">While in the context of immigration policy, there have been efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against the population decline, among the local population that has caused resentment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of Singapore's Web site, is to see the overt xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who have been criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year recorded a governing party Singapore its worst election result since the start of independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election, appeared to deal with the problem by using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unintended consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the decline in fertility rates has known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health, and the politics of immigration, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to get as many small brick home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, began to affect the real estate business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as the “shoe box”, which could be built in certain urban areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These flats are area 46 square meters and have great success in marketability.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that they may support a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers, to build a large single-family houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the developers El Developers, arguing that their “shoe box” sold far more quickly than larger houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">“They are popular, and so that will be sold on the days and weeks faster than houses with greater size.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, for our cash flow is much better.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But to admit that the new standards set clearer rules for developers, who were previously limited, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much on edge</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although the new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate, the nation's conversation with Singapurci workers in the financial district in the centre of the city suggests that they will have a big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, that many people put off,” says the young officer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">“The rest of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="47">But it's important for me to rely on their own time and money,” said another, a 20-year-old boy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women cite career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So let the government seeks to citizens in any way forced to have children, they are all ultimately Singapurci, regarding the creation of a family who have the last word.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to the dictionary, published by the Royal Spanish Academy is about something that is personal in nature, or the “area of private life, which has every right to protect against any disruption”.</seg>

<seg id="7">Journalists from elPeriódico spoke to five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years, who are frequent users of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="8">In four of the cases considered the concept of privacy for “something entirely his own” on a personal level and as a “user name and password” when they were on the social network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">“My biggest secrets would publish,” says a 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger's accounts for the past two years.</seg>
<seg id="10">“It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">“I'm pretty pictures on FB or photos, how we play.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also says there are known.</seg>
<seg id="13">I share the picture, which would not be my picture, or that anyone would ridicule,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, photographs of naked people or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge says he knows all the 35 friends on FB and its nine fans on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the relatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Among them: a mother who has a name and password of one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">“I opened an account on Twitter, to express their views and write interesting contributions.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't know if somebody tells me there is only so I give,” he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">“Social networks are amusing, I can speak with relatives who are far more quickly or to communicate with friends,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Without hesitation, he says that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">No one would have cared if he had been recommended by a stranger.</seg>

<seg id="25">“I don't have fear, because we have something in common, such as music,” he says.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="26">According to the boy, he was not one of them didn't instruct, nor did they want to address or telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="27">“If me or that I wanted simply to be removed from your account,” she says.</seg>

<seg id="38">Even though I know that it's direct,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Key issues</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porrasová, english teacher and graduate business education and teaching, considers that to children and adolescents in social networks correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">States that: “the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but as the social network, has changed the rules of the game.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article, digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">“Digital natives are children and young people, who were born at the time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We are digital immigrants, who need to learn, and they themselves are learning to do,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that it is a difficult subject, “because we are asking them to recognize what is appropriate to publish and distribute, say, and what did not, in an age when we are not yet ripe.”</seg>
<seg id="46">Also to be-to-slow, at a time when what they most want is a popular, have thousands of friends and think about the consequences,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the engineers is the most efficient way to children and adolescents to show what it's privacy, asking questions, which is forcing us to think.</seg>
<seg id="48">“Tell them to do something, it doesn't work,” he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that would tell a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: would you like it if someone has published a picture of you as you published his?</seg>
<seg id="51">You know, what about you other published?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you call the person in the photos of the celebrations, did you ask these people to leave?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more: they need to keep all know, what are you doing now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">“People outside of the Internet by respect, morality and other principles and the same should be on social networks,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Surveillance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains, it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">“If you understand the intricacies of every single, have a good basis to talk with children about the consequences of opening an account on the Internet can be.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or to publish it,” he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> Guardia is of the view that it is essential to remind children of the traditional rule of “Don't talk to strangers.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the objective, in which “South America, in this case we really must learn from Europe.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who was part of the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state tv that the Europeans “Perú, was killed in World War II” and in other conflicts, “but now they are virtually one country”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, defended the project for the creation of a south american citizenship, which member countries of Unasur support.</seg>
<seg id="5">“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any south american country, which is already underway between the members of the Andean Community, however, there are still backward areas that they want us to go back to the past,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Ecuador's president, among other things, that agrees with the reformation of the Organization of American States (OAS), on the condition that it will reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">“Those who are in the lead, never to be binding, and the South Americans, on the other hand, we all signed up.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission in Washington, D.C., financed by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted to Ecuador, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">President Correa has confirmed that this decision regrets because he had betrayed his principles and respect for its “deep democratic values and human rights”.</seg>
<seg id="10">Added to that, at the time, “there is reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country, irrespective of the ongoing process”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, criticised the swedish justice, who asked him to take on swedish territory underwent questioning about alleged sexual offence, while “own swedish legislation allows you to carry out the questioning of videoconferencing call, which could take place from the ecuadorian embassy in London”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa has said that there is a risk that, in the case of Assangeho there is a deterioration in the physical and psychological health.</seg>
<seg id="13">“I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but Ambassador informed me that my small lung problems, but nothing serious,” said ecuadorean head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“However, the possibility that his physical and psychological state worse because it is locked up in a small space with no possibility of movement in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="15">It would have affected the health of each,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in Quito, the embassy in London, on the basis of authorization, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, and pointed out that the London talks were held in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">“We are not negotiating with regard to human rights, such a word in this case we use, but still continued talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, because Assangeův lawyer Balthazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various european instances,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Saying that “if the United Kingdom will pass tomorrow, it's all over.”</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears in Quito, the embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the problem without the legislation, as has been done in other cases, tomorrow there will be this problem by the end.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa has taken advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and to make it clear that certainly does not tolerate “podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, which undermines freedom of expression”.</seg>
<seg id="22">The biggest enemy of a free press is not us, the mean-spirited and evil politicians, but a bad press in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">From this point of view, expressed joy at the fact that no such journalists, “neither bankers nor a hegemonic country and not the bourgeoisie with Ecuador”, and said that, if re-elected, “will continue in the changes by the right way and in the right direction”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">President Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto by Paraguay on membership of the Unasur, at least until its next election, arguing that the whole “must be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and pučismus wrapped in legality”, because in fact “destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In addition, the ecuadorean president said that is “totally appropriate” the wishes of his colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the aftermath of the judgment of the International Court in the Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">“It's a problem between the South American and Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is to be assessed carefully, in order to overcome and was able to go forward.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also expressed hope for a settlement of the dispute over maritime borders, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that “it is for Latin America the right to seek international appeal, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, whatever it may be, no matter how hard.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In connection with the possibility that he may run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to make a serious bid for a third term of office, said that he sees the possibility of “with a great deal of optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult.”</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that if in February 2013 loses the elections, retire from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">“I personally never cared much, but so unfair situations, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, may be correct only political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">My political movement believed that it was I who ensures that likely victory, then we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">“If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term, and then I walked away from politics.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, I'm going to do the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="37">I've already decided,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez to Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">“I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chavez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not a relapse in the health of the president,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The head of the Ecuadorian State today attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended by calling for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality, and security.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">AIDS victims are today due to late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the results of his test: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">“It was as if to me was struck by lightning,” says the memory of the moment of truth, the doctor tried to “softening”, but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy's family before holding.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his illness itself onto their shoulders and began to communicate it. and with such dedication that he celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the earliest patients units of HIV in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara (my H), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was unthinkable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's not the director of the clinic the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) farewell, “because it was cut.”</seg>
<seg id="9">When AIDS have been synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible with this syndrome survive and fully live.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, there are a lot of people who don't know about his illness and they come when the virus caused the destruction of the body's immune system and the conflict in himself, and then they become victims of accidental infection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since the world has AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, “it is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who in a timely and appropriate manner, starting with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the unit of HIV in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara, that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability, the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, the better it is for those who use drugs: people with 200 cells 400 can live up to 30 years and people with 400 to 500 cells for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that those who have been diagnosed with HIV in 25 years, according to these findings “in compliance with treatment live without problems up to 75 years,” he said in an interview with the doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To highlight this progress, it should be noted that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the death rate has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (yearbook the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS, UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year, 187. however, since 2005 to ensure universal access to antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why people continue to die on the consequences of the disease?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> “It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">As I see it, this is happening to us in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">For at least the past 12 years we have not run out of medical supplies. the problem is that patients are coming at a very late stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds a compelling figure: “nine out of ten patients coming in, if we're going to show some associated infections. all that needs to be done in order to have more influence on the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier and, therefore, it should be on a large scale to offer testing for the disease to all persons who requests it.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who had come to do tests to private laboratories, just because he did it to his friend, and despite his young age with him for outbreaks of disease AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma, also suffered from cancer, which is one of the most common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">“Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some might think that they were going to die, and they don't want to know more.</seg>
<seg id="26">“If I have to die, I'd rather be vyřádím three times a week,” they say, but that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, medication.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, his parents knew only that he was suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">“I live a normal life like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to themselves and to the other person,” lists Fabrizio, who has taken up the challenge to share its experience with the diary MILENIO Jalisco to today in the World AIDS Day was motivated by his testimony to those who are worried.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">“Whatever they do tests. if risk, so let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, it's better. and if you have been diagnosed, they realize that they can live like anyone else, when they will be held accountable.”</seg>
<seg id="32">This sums up the message of his battle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar guadalajarský journalist who reveal information about the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest gaps in prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, which is dedicated to this task “is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us the packages, as well as hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">“What do you want to do it?” is the question of full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and medical staff, the teenagers want to avoid, the reporter says.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested this inefficient distribution change. whether condoms are not only behind counters, but the hundred or so is located in dávkovačích public toilet, in places frequented by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">“It's not promoting promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's not that they “pay and the beer,” said Governor Emilio González, when asked if he agrees with the distribution of condoms in his district.</seg>
<seg id="42">Takovásexualita. it is best to make condoms to those who had sexual habits,” he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key figures in the state of Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It was recorded 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of HIV / AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">This state of affairs is in fourth place in New Mexico and cases of AIDS and 13th place in connection with HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the disease progresses through sexual contact, 6% of blood through y 2% perinatálně.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is estimated that with the HIV virus can live for about 50,000 people, since on the one established case is four to five people who don't know about the disease.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judgment by the Court of Appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company's bankruptcy in vitro by Mexico, causing disastrous precedent for any national enterprise with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">So, it seems that the practices of corporate restructurings, which allow mexican laws in the country lanes and stars in defiance of international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Approval of the decision by 15 June last year the judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas' practice of mexican firms with no defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the judgment opens the mexican producers of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">To begin with, it must be said that, while the judge this case contends that the creditors have to obey the law of the United States, the Court of Appeal the fifth district, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides the insolvency proceedings in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For one thing, it would suggest a lack of international legal cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, for this purpose, the law created a model of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which specifies the arbiter of the organisation of the American Law Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgment states that vote without branches of internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company in vitro to branches, had not reached the required majority to approve the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the possibility of mexican laws allow.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fact of the matter is that the case was the first in vitro company, which was adopted this scheme.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are a half-dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose transfer debts guaranteed federal bankruptcy Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of branches, creditors-who vitro stood against the company in a court of law in the United States, i. e. the funds “vultures”, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited-achieved a majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the vote would have reached about 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This figure does not take into account the decision of the Court of Appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another perspective, accuses the company of in vitro from the difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 — against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis that has hit the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, the family firm Gonzalez set to appeal to the new assessment directly to the Court of Appeal that the examination was carried out with the full participation, with the participation of the five judges, because originally voted in only three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">If this does not succeed here, will require a revision of the appeal process more instances of, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case is serious, that the court failed to document sent by the mexican government as the amicus curiae, which is described in detail in vitro procedure of the bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company was eased by the beginning of the agreements signed by both countries, to confronted the act with chapter 15 Insolvenčního Act of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Navícse points out that the country is complying with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantees equality for debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The impact on both sides: punishment for a company in vitro and the state.</seg>

<seg id="11">“It was my best years that I had enjoyed, because I had the opportunity to be with the team, los Vaqueros since 1967, participate in eight championships, either as the owner, the co-owner, or the coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I had one playoff game farewell — in 1981, when he made his debut in BSN Jerome Mincy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the team took “Cuco” him, which was an excellent leader,” said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">“I remember Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach and then worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me: “I want you to make a 6-foot player.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want it?”</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow me then recommended the ball Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that said that if Mincy Bayamonu will bring victory in the championship, then Gausse will contribute to the further.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship, where the team played for Los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, as in 1988 has pursued as President of Basketball Federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">In that time, he wanted to fully devote their functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">“I remember when we first defeated the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we are, but we have a bronze if it weren't for the canadian referee, who let us repeat final face-off,” said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you ever saw?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, as well as the one that defeated the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the national team in panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we're the guys trounced the United States, which was very similar to that which we blew a bronze at the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">The team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona RIVAS, Fico Lopez and “Piculína” (him), but there were also teenagers (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, who couldn't be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which might not be perfect, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, the men were from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in argentine Neuquénu.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the players on the roster, as were “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced player ruled out because of a clash in panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions we won gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It was without any doubt Piculín him.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of international tournaments, are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one from Puerto Rico achieved at this level of such results as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to mention his involvement in different leagues, where he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best coach of the Puerto Rican?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">The young, I very much like the work Leo Arilla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">His success in the Federation consider the greatest?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">That was part of the era's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s was the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> What you didn't get a chance to prove it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things I wanted to put in place, such as the division of youth categories according to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island in a national playoff.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now a lot of travelling and playing too many games, which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">I can also see a benefit in mandatory certification and training courses for coaches, referees and assistant referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am pleased about that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What is now considering?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I'm enjoying my grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.</seg>

<seg id="1">Starts on the course, which examines the “end of the world”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Each week, students studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">When a religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester's course about the end of the world, knowing that it's irresistible temptation: the end of “a number of” the mayan calendar, which has come December 21, caught many people as evidence that the end of the world is coming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Charmé, however, had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call the “Armageddon” debt, and the growing conflict, in which Israel is involved, the place where, according to Christian teoretizujících about the end of the world will begin the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“I didn't realize this would be nejapokalyptičtější semester there ever has been,” said Charmé this week students Rutgersovy University in Camden, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the man finally, what is happening today in the world, as if we had 30 days, it's a really good time.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember, that is bad for the apocalyptic-minded good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And that's not the only professor, which offers courses on the “end of the world” in this semester, which is, in theory, the latest in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At Temple University hosting Assistant Barry Vacker course “resources, culture and the end of the world”.</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week, students studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">“We have been discussing these ideas with the time expanding,” he says, and both offer a hypothetical scenario, which is governed by a human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">For example, if the nuclear material can get into the hands of terrorists, the war could erupt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how it differs from the examples from real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, possible and impossible,” says Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, was put together by a professor of latin american history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, to hold a course with a simple name for the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“Nepřipojujeme “2012”, because we always expect, with the possibility of a course again in the event that the world will not end,” said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the “impending doom” to students to study, develop projects and do the final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">On Penn State's final test is to take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which makes students with no option but to work “until just before nightfall predicted the end of the world,” said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Courses have become quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">“Expanding into two hours,” said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which has claimed 35.</seg>
<seg id="21">For weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mail questions whether it is still place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students themselves to assure themselves that the course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort ourselves,” she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="24">And so the apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs, it is only a matter of comfort, or the lack of it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">Will Wekesa, 25 year-old student of psychology and nursing, he said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">“I'd never heard of the hour at which it could teach,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">“I am enjoying it.”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no vyzpovídaný student, let alone a professor, said that he believes in the end date of December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">“Our first project was about the mayan prediction, and in some ways we are disproving it,” said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">“The Mayans never foreseen for the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar,” said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he added that in western culture is an apocalyptic anxiety, which goes back centuries in which people respond to changes in their environment predictions about the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The flowering of this speculation caused by the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">“The rest of the people,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is overwhelmingly in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, which puts this year in the Philippines, on the question of whether there knows about a course on the “end of the world”, he answered quickly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">“The Philippines is not the end of the world,” he wrote, and suggested an exemption for the highest office.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a reprieve from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall said that over the years has been talked about for many days at the end of the court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, “people will begin immediately to think about the next day” or philosophical, that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, at the end of which the world is extinguished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The date of the take lightly the students and professors.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several of them said that they intended to go to the “end of the world”.</seg>
