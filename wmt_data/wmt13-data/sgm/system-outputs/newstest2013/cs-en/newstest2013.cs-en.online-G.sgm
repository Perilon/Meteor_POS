<h1>
<seg id="1">The strategy of the republican party against Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders of the reasons its policy need to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennanovo center, however, such a scam referred to as a myth with the fact that electoral fraud is in the US is less frequent than the number of persons who die after being struck by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican attorneys indeed, for the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures are partly undermine the american democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada have in the US, the responsibility for the organization of federal elections, the individual states.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in this spirit, the majority of the us government from 2009 announces the new laws, which make it difficult for the process of the elections or of the registration of the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon recorded a boom after the elections in November 2010, during which attracted 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only a year 2011 submitted to 180 proposals of the law limiting the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New election laws require voters to present photo id and proof of u.s. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">These laws also restrict the period for the elections in advance, zneplatňují the right to enroll in the list of voters on the election day and odnímají right to vote of citizens by entry in the criminal register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006 did not require the electorate submission půkazu photo identification no american state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first state to which this requirement imposed were Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutionality of the indianského of the law was confirmed in the year 2008, the US Supreme court.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities spěchaly with the extension of this procedure as well as to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the last two years to support the proposals of such laws in 34 states, with the aim to force the voters to present identity cards with photos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that apart from Quebec american citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, the half-11% of u.s. citizens, i.e. 21 million people in the age of allowing a vote of no identity card with a photo issued by the government authority of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Further does not have such identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">The acquisition of the desired identity card, in addition, is often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities, and persons with low income.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of african-americans, 15% of those with income below 35 000 dollars; 18% of citizens aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years, therefore, does not have the required photo id.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students, who are as voters known for their conversion to the democratic candidates, not in several states authorized to use your photo id issued by your school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same states allow the members of the hunting or fishing clubs who elects rather the republican candidates, the cards issued by these clubs in the election of use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the year 2004 did not require any state at the elections and proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">First, such a requirement introduced Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">From the year 2011 has adopted about twelve states ' laws, which establishes the obligation of the voters to prove that they are american citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures clearly are directed to the limitation of the number of votes from the hispanic minority.</seg>
<seg id="31">Should indeed be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislativci in 2011 supported in eight states laws, which cancels the registration of voters on election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">To limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have its consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the general election in 2004, helped campaign for the registration of voters to register, about 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken after the year of 2009 but caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 to about 17% compared to the year 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican lawmakers then in the other five states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008, Florida african-americans accounted for 33% of the voters who have voted in advance, although african-american voters in this state was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">For Hispanics was the case as well.</seg>
<seg id="40">Accounted for just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other side of the whites, who represented 76% of all voters, were only 46% of voters who have voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Against the pass laws, which restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly opposed democratic lawmakers and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors have blocked his veto of the several draft laws.</seg>
<seg id="44">In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws even hit the attorney general of the United states.</seg>
<seg id="45">The damage they partly succeeded in limiting.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, laws requiring proof of identity with photo adopted only 16 of the 34 states.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly introduced rules, however, absolutely, undeniably difficult in 2012, the exercise of voting rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics of the talks primarily about the bias of the approved laws and regarded them as an overt attempt to influence the results of the elections in the year 2012 in the key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report Brennanova resort from the year 2011 shows that the states, where these laws approved, represent 171 of 270 votes of the electoral college of the necessary for the victory in the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to declare with certainty, that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain today: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures are partly undermine the american democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">The detection of prostate cancer: pass the examination or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA Test was bringing sometimes erroneous results, which have been negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical zákrokům.</seg>
<seg id="3">All this has increased the hesitancy of the men who have already been reluctant to examination at all to go.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let investigate or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked for the opinion of two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the USA has shown the high degree of contamination between the tested groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the european, noted the different mortality rates among patients who underwent examination, and those who did not go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also demonstrated after 12letém distance, that those who on the examination do not go, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of the occurrence of metastases.</seg>
<seg id="9">I recommend, therefore, examination from the age of 50 or 40 years, if your direct relative had the cancer of the prostate.</seg>
<seg id="10">More endangered group are also men of the afro-american origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision, once the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive types of cancer and such species, which are inert.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the degree of hazard of his type of cancer, offer him a possible alternatives, neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which does not in the long-term impact on the lives of, and focus in these cases, rather on the active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, a number of men, in which the cancer was diagnosed, untreated, because their kind of cancer is aggressive and damaging to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We propose to them rather the implementation of active surveillance, and in the case of progression of the disease to be offered treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater precision, we are setting the criteria, which can help in deciding which kind of treat and which is not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet, therefore I recommend to pass the examination.</seg>
<seg id="18">The important thing is to pass the interview with the doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo examination or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International urologic companies have developed Movember tool, which enables to evaluate for and against in the context of the examination of the DOG.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document can be downloaded (currently in English, translation will be available later) at this address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Prevention of diseases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately there is no magic procedure for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the advances in research seems the best means for reducing the risk of diseases of the adoption of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all of healthy eating and sufficiently moved about, you could prevent up to 30% of cancer cases.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If everyone quit smoking, this figure would be increased to at least 50%," underlines Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian society for research on cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancer causing inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the canadian society for research on cancer remains a priority the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers decreases.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also a risk factor for several others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," shaking his head spokesman Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging indication: 10 years after the smoker to stop smoking decreases the risk of cancer deaths by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Tělnatost and obesity are according to the SCC another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and the uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout the life protects against cancer of the colon," adds the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The mentioned organization is also recommended to limit the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">At too high consumption can lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is advisable to avoid and cold cuts, for which the same is true.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Preserving of meat smoking, drying or solením can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," adds the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Recently, the scientists focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Research, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are, according to the SCC contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although according to one of them happens to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies talk rather about its increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or the effect of vitamin D for cancer is not clearly established.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr. Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and precedentech of the family with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"To undergo tests does not mean that you have cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The higgs boson explored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Notice of the likely the discovery of the Higgs boson triggered last summer legitimate stir.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is an opinion, that this boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all matter in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And the last particle, the existence of which predicts the standard model - our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Between physics, however, so far there is not one hundred percent certainty, that the terms of the Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">Doubts about the fact that we have available a completely new particle, which is very similar to this higgs boson, as is predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">New data published this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto, rather confirmed, but there are no yet any data to enable us to have absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, suppose that the terms of the Higgs boson, since the risks error appears as a small, and look at what's actually going on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world is completely true unquestionable law, according to which the two things cannot exist in the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule cannot bypass - and do not attempt to about it too hard, otherwise you harm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although it is particle physics a very strange world, it turns out that even in the case it applies a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "kvantovém state" - this "state" of the roughly speaking, creates some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Further divided physicists particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens or fermions, which obediently follow the Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end of the range bosony, very crooked anarchists, who do not appreciate at all nothing - certainly not of this principle, which means that they can feel free to be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of the Berkeley: mesony, that here we leave unnoticed, and the "power of the particles", which spreads the great forces of nature and with whom is the Higgs boson probably in some way related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Must say, however, that these bosony are not so exotic animals, how it would be possible to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If this article read, it is because of boson with unusual banality: the photon, or "particle of light", which is "the bearer of the" electromagnetic forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the particles with electric charge to accelerate or change its direction, "cancel out" by electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "intervention" will create an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than fotonem - and thus one of the bosons, "holders of power".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Also is it with the Higgsovým bosonem, with the only difference that the "cancel out" is to be other fields, Higgsovo field, to this boson discovered.</seg>
<seg id="22">This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to his right, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similarly as with the frozen levels of the pond, already zčeří just a lot of large boulder.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part of the accelerator as a catalyst in the laboratory CERN - the large hadron collider is friendly ties is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! -in order to develop such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field with us again suited to the clarification of the relation between the Higgsem and matter.</seg>
<seg id="25">With the electromagnetic field do not respond-not all particles or all of the materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, for example, magnets, do so, but not others - a piece of paper, for example, will never be alone by yourself to stick to the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And the same is true, that with the Higgsovým field do not respond to all the particles: the ones that do, have a certain mass, while the other (such as a photon, let's look at it) don't have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And mrs Novakova is asking, what all of these researches are, what "will bring us"?</seg>
<seg id="29">From the point of view of science it comes to the confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to undergo the examination of any inconsistency between the observations and predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many physicists moreover, literally wants to be managed is found, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and to close some of the gaps in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It must be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not bring any explanation of gravity (whoa!) or dark matter, which account for about 80% of the space of matter (again!).</seg>
<seg id="32">Equipment CERN, however, until now such contradictions have not appeared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Response</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The response of these research in the everyday life of mr and mrs Novákových can be predicted only a very difficult, a mistake, however, to believe that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lo: in the very beginning of 60th years not one of the pioneers of laser at Bell labs had no idea of the revolution, which their work will cause.</seg>
<seg id="36">Expected scientific use, but nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="37">Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where he was the laser in 1960 invented, and which has created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy in the lab".</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, the application of the result and of all the instruments, which surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969, during their work on the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, even when it Boyle initially at all so I didn't, and now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel prize for physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC we necessarily need to change the life, however, this means that one never really knows...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care - the Best way to leave from the life of... | Le Devoir"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through its Commission for a dignified death is Quebec recently engaged in an awkward questions about end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should soon resume and at the same time is going to the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this crucial area remains to be done, still a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="5">The magazine Le Devoir", tried to look at this issue in more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Before less than a couple of weeks ago, lived mr. L. still alone in my apartment in Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer that has been eating away at, gave him a two-year reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Give me five years of life and it has been seven," said without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is still a shock, so you can't prepare," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has done its work: the enormous weakness of him makes it impossible to remove itself to the toilet or just feed himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given looks at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees that he help you to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is courageous and even smiles, talks with the unknown, who is for him to stop, brings him his medications, offer a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My biggest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, he humiliates me," says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later found a team of doctors on his problem drug.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Throughout the life of one learns that the guys in the urine standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the device Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">To return to the stage the child is for some people an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"Depends on the ability of the person's"whether the return shall adopt, says the psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the opinion of the number of persons involved in palliative care, the essential moments taking place in the very core of such a return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who are embarking into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, suffer from all of the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Their forecast is for a maximum of three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage of them the team of doctors and nurses who care for them, does not provide the so-called "therapeutic" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the case of mrs A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die "on the suffocation in full consciousness."</seg>
<seg id="24">The disease to me but to allow to discover your children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good kids," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In life already I have no desire to," he says, and then agrees to have breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet looking forward to in the coming days on the last visit of the son of Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in collaboration with a group of volunteers providing care for the body with the help of nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">So, it looks like palliative care, which starts, if no longer possible to do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">That death was more convenient.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Québeku accounts for one bed palliative care at 11 700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is very little, if we realize that we all once we die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life goes on in the best conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors in the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether in terms of the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When a man dies, can he provide, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics you no longer need to watch your blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is a part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening bear beer mr X., which later in the night he died.</seg>
<seg id="39">Today in the morning dopije beer his son in honor of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardová, director of nursing services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the home of Victor-Gadbois the days go one after another, but like each other.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to the třiadevadesátiletého the man who delights in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on the cushions, while he připíjejí in his honor, dies tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after having tried all the options to do in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"It half a year there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years," she said with concern, dr. Christiane Martelová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients, who in the home Victor-Gadbois come, come here from their homes, 47% of the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. to the care that is intended to alleviate the suffering, as soon as the sick reaches the final phase of their life, whether it is at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And a few organizations, such as the home of the Victor-Gadbois and the Company for the home palliative care Grand Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And it is this crucial unavailability of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is in circulation the manifest signed by the leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to dr. Christiane Martelové is not quebecký health system powerful enough to ensure the access of all persons to quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree to carry out euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, has recently experienced a patient who has spent 14 days in the emergency room in a huge pain without anyone done the necessary steps to make her feel relieved.</seg>
<seg id="52">Fears that the patients did not ask for the killing because of the fact that they do not get appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients, up to the last moment regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hope for the survival of the Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, when she left the intensive chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I onkoložce told that I finish with the treatment, she answered, that regrets that stoping fight, he tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">And while she told me that it is the end!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is omnipotent care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The doctor Martelová it is estimated that 90% of the patients who wish to die, thanks to his treating doctors at it, that their wishes please complete, when they team of palliative píče eased the pain.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="2">In this season you with PSG have deployed a completely new pace.</seg>

<seg id="17">And furthermore, I Carlo Ancelotti gives a lot of in connection with my status.</seg>
<seg id="18">The hand has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who used to play on the same post as I am.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And Ancelotti has the decisive word in the right moment?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti has the respect of all of the technicians.</seg>

<seg id="26">In January I am with him he graduated from the soothing conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had a number of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust, which provides me with, is another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As you look at the first part of the season, PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 1st league of the us Lyon picked up a frontal position.</seg>
<seg id="31">We remain but in tow.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is to champions League: very easy, we advanced to the round.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is your club in this competition the goal?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far away as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be for the european quality teams tough opponent.</seg>
<seg id="37">We want first of all to win their qualifying group ahead of the Port, in order to be able to play in retaliation round at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can PSG stand in the short term, a major european club?</seg>
<seg id="39">The budget already on it...</seg>
<seg id="40">To Paris has become a major european club, they need to win titles and enroll in history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not yet the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">The financial page of the PSG has the resources to make this intention did take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a big failure nezvítězit in the 1st league as in last year's season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="46">In last year's season, we are still very lacking.</seg>
<seg id="47">In may, we were disappointed because we had to win the game.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had an excellent season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have collected 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Usually, with 79 points you have a clear master...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think that this year it will lead.</seg>
<seg id="53">Although the title and the big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think, is that we have weapons, we beat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from the PSG expect too?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect from us a lot due to the fact that we have invested and what our players.</seg>
<seg id="56">It absolutely accept it.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is a fact that when at home defeat Troyes 4:0 and I still have yet to find something to us in the newspaper to read, so it's not exactly pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders, what from you people yet they want more.</seg>
<seg id="59">This is not, of course, winning 4:0 on every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not FC Barcelona!!!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to adjust your playing style.</seg>
<seg id="62">To build a team you need the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the champions League we have proved that we can play.</seg>
<seg id="64">Have a look at Manchester City, which is already the second season qualified for the round, and in doing so too have invested large amounts of money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Due to the invested amounts you would expect that you will be in front of the other 15 points ahead of the game!</seg>
<seg id="66">By urážíte other clubs and the French league.</seg>
<seg id="67">Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which is in last year's season too failed, with the new PSG have moved into the next phase.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how the 1. liga amazing.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say that despite all of the difficulties we managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as if the PSG in all relied on the performances of the Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that says that there is a "dependency on Zlatanovi".</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful and it gives a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Because of this came here and proves that it is the star of the 1st league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he has demonstrated that he is a great player, a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our team we respect the man and the players.</seg>
<seg id="76">And he respects people around us has.</seg>
<seg id="77">It's what he has achieved is truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">It has led others to the fact that increase their own level of play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, too allows other next to each other to grow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you experienced the Euro 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="83">Unfortunately, due to an injury I couldn't play the way I imagined.</seg>
<seg id="84">But I have experienced it and I walked out of it stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I was doing well in the national team to play good matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">And in this I was hoping since its onset in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe to ourselves, to our demeanor exemplary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanks Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without bank</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">All the negative aspects of the current financial transactions are based on the central banks, identified transactions, and the cost for processing among the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="3">As in the framework of these technologies, moreover, often the truth is here to feel the apparent political views: the belief that the existing financial system built on the bank monopolies leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Bitcoin, which the inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), it represents both a virtual money (transferable, however, dollars, euro...), so secure transfer protocol similar to Bittorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to the 15 000 computers participating in the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand of websites already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Course bitcoinu first reached a high of $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, about five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today it is on the border of about ten dollars (an overview of the courses is listed on the page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products it is nothing impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet the European central bank (ECB) on this fact interested in its report on the virtual finances, which came out in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin describes as "the most successful virtual money", "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "equivalent of the conventional money".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin from other kinds of virtual money distinguished by the fact that it is as "credits" to be used for the procedure in a video game, which a person acquires the game, or that you can buy (and sometimes even back to replace).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each month, but the central authority shall monitor and process individual communications.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes of the network to the depositary of the books of the current accounts, controllers, issuers of money, and the buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How this network works?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is underway in fact between the two email addresses, using e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">The user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information associated with this transaction is electronically signed by the encryption system with a double-key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network so it can verify the legitimacy of transactions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins existed in the public book of the current account, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key phase in the registration of this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">Takes place with the help solve the mathematical task of the specified computers, whose principal investigator, a member of the temporary central banker, will have the right to pass this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the stage of cutting of the file; i.e., the transformation of a huge file on the shorter and unique digital fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computer "take over" this new transaction and add to it a number, then the whole "rozsekají".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number to find the other nodes easy to check its correctness.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then nezničitelně displays attached to a string, all other transactions; any adjustment to the change of the fingerprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the user would like for the purpose of fraud to pay twice for the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, which will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to prevent inflation, is this the reward of the regular two, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by the number of 21 million, however, you can share up to stomilióntinu, so that the margin for margin there is...</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the task set, also increases with increasing levels of calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network has had its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The website, which for the Bitcoin provide services, have been attacked, and there has been stolen stored bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Used skulina not the protocol itself," he assures Pierre Noizat, who founded the Paymium, the company for the payment of real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this problem also applies to cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, is to be adopted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of the current accounts and proved that nearly 80% of the bitcoins neobíhá.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November launched the "huge discounts".</seg>
<seg id="42">"Was replaced thirty thousand dollars," he rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul engaged in the transformation of bitcoins to gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books relating to such money has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to the credit card (real money) or bezkontaktnímu the payment of a cell phone, but it uses the system Became for the verification of transactions, which are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">Nobel moreover, manages their identity and thus can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to set up for traders, where there is no need to install a new terminal or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just tell the address, which can be a phone "ofotografovat and recognize", explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">Occurs to the general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to horizontálnějším systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before they Became the champions, even it it can take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.</seg>

<seg id="4">In the middle of the announced irrespective of the opinion of all the others, that the Constituent assembly on the morrow shall approve the final text.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago has awarded the head of state to this assembly the next two months to complete the necessary work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For almost two years now uses Egypt provisional text, which was many times replenished, which weakens the constitutional stability in the country and leads to the legal arguments.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the point of view of the opposition of the president persists in his "autokratickém delirious", continue to "breach of its word" and "flies in the face of the law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His supporters, however, assure, that it is a means to quickly take out the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transitional process.</seg>
<seg id="10">For two weeks there should be a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short time period, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intent of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president it is also a way to once again achieve the national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rocked by protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview for the american weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems to be convinced, that the Egyptians will vote for.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially because this is a hastily organized the vote puts the people before the ultimatum: "Either approve my text, or can I leave the unlimited powers", which otherwise would have after the adoption of the new constitution to end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of the constituent assembly with the large majority of islamists text approved.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the liberals in the vote was missing.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, not long before the promulgation of the constitution, bouchli the door with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Human rights defenders, civil society, members of religious minorities, their step imitated.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 persons from among the alternates.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators on stopped over the fact that one of a handful of disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the clock in the meeting room are not correctly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Text which is voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of general attention, article 2, remains ultimately the same with the version of the constitution of 1971 and provides that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law".</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafist party, to which the introduction of islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping, that will replace the term "principles" of the term "rules", which would allow stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For islamists in turn, the fact that this article has not been corrected, represents a sign of their good will and respect for the other parts of the egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy", they say, the liberals, who see it as just a rhetorical problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, namely the islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They focus in particular on article 220, which entrusts the university of al-Azhar advisory role, in particular for the questions of the control of the conformity of the laws with the law of the sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the expert Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is upsetting, because "a person being able to express not chosen, and they have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can in fact see the beginnings of a theocracy".</seg>
<seg id="32">The concerns of liberals even more stirring up the fact that the next rector of the university should be less restrained than the one existing.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For the time being displayed no specific religious consequence.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution remains Egypt general civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers, who in this text have worked, are not ulamové, but the university workers, many of them studied in the French schools," the meek concerns Alexis Blouet, which prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, agrees with the fact that "there may be contradictions concerning the interpretation of article 220, because in it the terms used to belong to religious terminology.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is here, in particular, the reference to "fiqh" [islamic jurisprudence, note the red.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may appear to the question of to what extent are the civilian judges competent, in order to be able to express themselves".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday approved the text is in addition to the religious sites highly criticized because of the extended powers, which is granted by the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The muslim brotherhood insists that occurred to their significant reduction compared to the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another issue: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the members of the military will not be the verification of the defence budget to carry out the parliament, but the National defense council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Further, then they will not be in the military courts prohibited the management of civilians, as requested by the association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The association speaks in connection with the text, which is directed against the freedom of its doubts.</seg>
<seg id="45">Criminal offence of blasphemy is maintained and how insulting it is to continue to disabled, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for printing.</seg>
<seg id="46">No article does not deal the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová of the organization Human Rights Watch.</seg>

<seg id="6">On 1 December, came into force a law, according to which everyone will be working migrant obliged to pass examination of knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">FMS however, the promises, that in time will be the appropriate tests compulsory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The test, however, will be composed not only of linguistic knowledge, but also of Russian history and of the foundations of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will be also necessary to attest to the acquisition and extension of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exemption applies only to citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">This law are not subject to nor for people who have successfully managed to achieve certifications and get academic diploma to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>

<seg id="14">The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the pushkin's Institute of the Russian language, of the University of friendship between the peoples, of the Moscow state university, the State university in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants may take exams in all the cities; it is already in Russia, opened more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to support the introduction of testing supported by members of the State duma and the FMS (Federal migration service).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, they were able to defenders of human rights many times lay in the press question:and what it will in fact bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">So first of all correspond to the representatives of the migration service - this will reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slave labor."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the board of directors of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be started already before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only a system of organized recruitment allow from 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems arise for the emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without knowledge of the language, - says with conviction Sebelev - is the future of migrants sentenced to conflicts with the rogue people who, under the pretext of assistance shall ensure the "voucher" to the terrible, tight hostels, in which he and dozens of other, like himself, to suffer for months without food and documents and to toil for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our migrant workers, we receive a lot of complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In their homeland they promise one thing, but after arrival is podvedou, seize them passports, paid the promised wages," confirms the Tajik head of the Main administration of labour migration MS Tolib Šaripov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not flame!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many of the citizens of the central asian republics, who intend to go for work to Russia, recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which they want to get, but do not have the experience even with the job.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course it is not their fault, but rather a misfortune:only a very few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families need something also to feed the children, not to mention the fact that you need is a decent dress, wear and equip the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children mature into productive age, must at the first opportunity, go for work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without knowledge of the language it is hard to admit it.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel the humiliation and méněcenní."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that with regard to the law on language testing point human rights defenders on the one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have a legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you have not, so they won't even take exams, or do not get any other official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, he lives most of the migrant workers as well as the first in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or Unauthorized access prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the coming of the workers claim that to get the official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all those linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Legalization in addition, the costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the Russian police know that we have basically a false documents, without registration, and there are cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Require one hundred, two cigarettes, tea," - he has shared with journalists their experience citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, don't be stingy to buy a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of the validity of the law on language was found that fake tend to be not only the documents on the registration of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="47">The staff of the FMS already confiscated several fake certificate of passing the language exam.</seg>
<seg id="48">Counterfeit documents are printed on plain color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners have not received a free lunch: each of the migrants in the hope that you so as to facilitate the problem with passing the tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times higher amount than the passing of the official test: this will become migrant workers three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">The MVD (Ministry of interior) does not take into circulation of illegal arms market</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The proportion of criminal offences with the use of legally-held weapons is very low</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">MVD of Russia presented a proposal for a tightening of the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the response of government authorities on the recent events: the impetus of the cases were shooting at weddings, which is done without victims, and the massacre prepared by the moscow lawyer Dimitrijem Vinogradovem, resulting in the deaths of seven people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The police wants to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">This idea supports the head of the duma committee for security, and the fight against corruption Irina Jarovaja, which has promised, that the amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State duma in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the way of "tightening the screws".</seg>
<seg id="8">In the network appeared an open letter, which the authors - representatives of different social shooting organisations, are demanding the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapons is the minimum, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian editorial office of the BBC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics of the Ministry of the interior for the six months of the year 2012 committed 142 of the criminal offences from the use of firearms registered authorities of the ministry of the interior, while for the same period were committed total 1168 thousand crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are convinced, the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons they do not lead the offender, in order passed to the "black" market.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to their words can currently find in Moscow any weapon at a low price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At present the Ministry of the interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: from the races after officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The "black" market of arms is supplied with several channels.</seg>
<seg id="16">The main channels of five, says colonel retired Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the ministry of education and the general staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">A Screenshot of the pages that accept orders weapons</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first of them - "the army or the military way", this means a weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The weapons stolen and Russian officers and caucasians themselves," says Baraněc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another type of "illegal weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals for representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that includes the theft of the police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the bodies active in criminal proceedings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal "mainly" enter into the sale of the military warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military warehouses often leads to outbursts.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is proven that some of the fires were based deliberately, so as to cover shortages," says a former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Your contribution bring according to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Currently arise private businesses are closing firearms, which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons, which they make available on the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of "black" market smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from the poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is their manufacture, sometimes here the weapons manufactured in the malovýrobě, and was created by the mafia, which organized their continued production," explains the former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where is the gun?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The experts they did number, what is the approximate market share of different sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this issue was in the year 2011 the Center of the analysis of the problems and the design of public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists examine the statements of the Ministry of the interior and the Russian bureau of statistics, kriminologickou literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, comes from the military and the executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all the weapons found itself on the black market "through the fault of the official agents, whose work is associated with weapons," it is said in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data, which have to be or not available, comes 17% of the weapons of the armed conflict, in 14% of cases occurred to the theft of weapons in their production, 5% is a "black archeology".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Salesman-consultant of one of the stores of weapons, who asked us to never mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations black "archeologists" a long time ago nobody not purchased - they are simply too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most often, as he says, vendors go for the new consignment directly to the military warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Through the midshipman get people interested buying a unit, such as a pistol TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">For him, the weapon of order and he will give it sells through the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Get it went into the city, and there it is sold for 900 euro per piece with two reservoirs," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The truth is, that the police is well in the picture, and therefore at any time they will start to burn plan in the detection rate of criminal offences, shall carry out a control purchase at retailers with illegal weapons," adds consultant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"As in a luxurious shop"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The seller to the buyer of the most often mutually located through their acquaintances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I attended the websites and blogs, until there is a guy who offered me the opportunity to go on a platform of the "Trial", where you will be a man who I would be led to the "corner", where together we will act.</seg>
<seg id="46">The price mainly I learned up there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, tells the salesman - consultant.- Such well-known I have, but fully him not to trust.</seg>
<seg id="49">Vendors on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from mr. Ivan Ivanoviče, who asked me to convey that the daughter dropped out a tooth."</seg>
<seg id="50">And now I get there through the man, whom I am sure.</seg>
<seg id="51">He is also delivers only me, because he knows that I neudám.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">A former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90s, when the processed paper for publication on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="54">Schemes, according to his words did not change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">They gave him the album with photos, where it was "everything what you think".</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like in a luxurious shop," he recalls of the soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer, according to the words of Baraněce, do not offer a pig in a poke - everything you can try.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, a potential client, simply nekupuji - here we go with the seller to the forest and how can we build target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Give me a chance to shoot, and when přesvědčím that the weapon shoots well, we are beginning to act," describes the procedure of the expert.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the US we have workers fastfoodů and supermarkets</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Work at checkout the establishments of the "McDonald's" passes up to a quarter of all american teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the last few days in America picked up a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of the company, Walmart, and in the restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave transforms into a wave of the ninth, or whether it is destined soon to be lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This whole share to support the trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the small salaries they receive the rank and file workers in Walmart and in the systems of fast foodí it is the goal of the organizers of the protests to achieve them in the creation of their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the odborářským movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week after thanksgiving, in the so-called "black Friday"when America struck orgy cheap sales, gripped the millions of inhabitants and in some cases has been accompanied by even rvačkami.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In this day some of the workers, the company Walmart, in which around the world working to 2.2 million people have left their workplace and to demonstrate together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinational companies, retail chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells throughout the world everything from diapers through hunting rifles and automotive batteries until after the vacuum cleaner, eggs, and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores are in average by 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, many of the employees with low wages in the stores Walmart purchases only for himself in the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and range of goods made of chain, Walmart, one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the words of the critics can Walmart afford to sell the goods as cheaply partly because only a few are paying their employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Protesters of the "black Friday" demanded increase of salaries and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from 30 up to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical worker Walmart gets a 9.5 dollars per hour, it does not correspond to the height of expenditure, say the staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase an average salary to $ 12 per hour, it will be the company to become 3.2 billion dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is on average by 1.1% more than the company spent on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company Walmart moves to increase wages fully on the shoulders of the consumers, will each visit to the shop in which the state only about 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as customers will spend approximately 12,39 dollars more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Advocates of the company Walmart point out that the protest is held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" in the stores of the company lasted from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time the company Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, its treasury carried out in the "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A representative of the company Dan Fogelman said in an interview for the left-leaning web site Huffington Post, that jobs have left a total of "fewer than five" of the staff of Walmart, and that the protest was all the trimmings "other media sensation", which organized by the trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Unfilled checkout!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim not to department stores Walmart (those in that pokrokovém the city are not too fond of, and therefore there is almost not), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says that sells billions portion, and then you or not paid sick leave and not pay you properly for your honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with the federal laws and with the regulations of the state of New York of 7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fastfoodové restaurant this wage gradually increase, but only slightly, and on average they receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city no one has a lower wage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Do not understand well enough, as you can in New York exist for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employment in "McDonald's" passes almost a quarter of the american teenager, who work behind the counter after school on a part-time job and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only a few people in regards it as its main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Currently constantly meet in an interview with the staff of the "McDonald's", who complain that they must live off of the money and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, at the forum the Wall Street Journal hanging comment, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, how are you going to feed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday at the "Mcdonald's" on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and the chefs at the enterprises of fast food began to receive at least $ 15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also demanded that in the sphere of fast food were based trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.s. laws prohibit the administration prevent the establishment of trade union organizations, and to punish the activist of the trade union movement victimisation and dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="42">From the other side of them, the administration rarely makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">To introduce in the enterprises of fast food trade unions is, however, complex and objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is an unusually high turnover of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The opposition of the</seg>

<p>
<seg id="46">On this day were held noisy protests in a number of other types of cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the event was at noon assembly on the "Mcdonald's" near Times Square, where there were few local democratic politicians, in particular, the member of the municipal council Jumaane Williams, who said:"McDonald's", says that sells billions portion, and then you or not paid sick leave and not pay you properly for your honest work!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Protesters have seen the support also of other prominent new york democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must together to speak out in support of the workers fastfoodů to achieve a fair reward for their work and the economic prosperity it deserves every new yorker!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the newspaper the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the american sphere of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is attended by only a few hundred people, even though by far not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Whether this event will become the spark that will ignite the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear.</seg>

<seg id="1">"So far, are doing brain deceive the average"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Among the fans of modern technologies of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; the last time it means to perceive the world, in particular through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference showcased Google working model of this news, and in November, it was reported, that the application for the patent filed also Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">From the interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that for the scientists of this company are the glasses already a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lures is the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Tell us please generally, the deals with your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with the interactions of humans with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Humanity has stuck in the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, at most, sometimes touching the screen with your finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to go looking for 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the console Xbox and sensor Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without sensors Kinect, because for all is a very interesting opportunity management using gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What is ahead of us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that the system Kinect transferred interaction on a physical level, very many interactions still ongoing on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The input flow of information has been improved (the system receives the greater the amount of data), but the output stream so far, not particularly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change it, we are working on a truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">Need to throw the computer world in our physical world, to make it more realistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to add into the real world of virtual objects in a much more suitable form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And first of all - to hell with those stupid helmets of a virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is the popular thing, but not be remeasured?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Certainly, it cannot be considered a panacea - the question arises as to privacy, because it is not always we want to inform others in our neighborhood about their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interaction with the computer are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for control devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about gestures, but not on the rozmáchlých, only on such skoupých, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gestures are doing nesnímala camera of the device, but the bracelet, which would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it is great, but in theory it can shrink to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, that the future has a mixed type of control, for example, a gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- And how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- To me, for example, you ask me you put this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will say it, and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually just simply speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So you want to force the user to adapt to what at any given moment can or cannot machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is not at all necessary, but it is of mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that are able to more accurately identify the reaction of the man.</seg>
<seg id="35">This can be, for example, laser sensor, which provide a relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you have to talk about their work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requirements to the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is now sufficient resolution, depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In essence, the current generation - that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional pattern recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course that would be a good idea to acquire 8 megapixels speed of 1000 f/s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But not just for the megapixels, but as the matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">While looking at the thing they are all the current technology for the lack of us - it přidělává the work of the designers of the algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to have in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movement is quite dynamic and present the data flows of 30 frames per second, frankly, are too little, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch the sensor with adjustable delay the processing of 1 up to 100 ms, with the current, mass produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of man with the machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me it would work was very helpful equivalent of such a device, only I do not need so much to touch, but I need some frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In the system Kinect are now used three of the "camera", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second - the receiver of reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And for the third camera - this is actually the normal scanner visible bandwidth.</seg>
<seg id="51">The latter shall not be applied to the determination of the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">The greater the number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse, because it would increase the required volume of the carried out calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, tinker around with differentiates the location of the cameras and have a look, as it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presenting publicly their glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of the technology of augmented reality using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>

<seg id="57">- Of course, go and constantly taking hold smatphone in the raised hands is not very convenient, but I think: the most powerful variant would be a "portable" the form of the expansion of the real estate, where it would be possible on the basis of platform clouds switch at any time from the glasses on the smartphone, the projection screen and a further round and round.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses - it is a very personal device, this is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also a weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on a virtual objects at the same time with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Starkovi in the "Iron Man", but also the normal smrtelníkovi.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one issue on which critics often point:there is no tactile feedback!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hand does not feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers preparing your group to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In his lectures often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think, that the addition of tactile sensations would easily could become the eighth breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">So far, using one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a certain type of substrate for imaging.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excellent records of compression!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding hmatatelnosti these "lines in the air" - the example of the interference of several of the direction of ultrasonic beams in a defined point, where is located the finger, it raises the tactile feel, but still it is very light - as if you blew on the pads of the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also a bracelet on her wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think, to feel what it seems, that should, at a given moment to feel something when they see?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- It is a good idea, we have unique venture to test not.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here appears yet another challenge that will fight for a long time - how to make a man who is physically located in a very cramped space, to believe that walking down an open, practically infinite space, we are also working on the concept of cross-country skiing tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge spheres.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, so it is work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes the work in the virtual reality of the so attractive to researchers - many of the things is downright its early stages.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Cyrile, so why do you go around the city the whole in the red and not in the yellow or, for example, in the tyrkysovém?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- I chose the color red as a designer engaged in appearance and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world represents the red color of the compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although the general rule is that everything is just a bit different from the grey, gives the aggression and waking up in the bad qualities.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are focused on it, that was linked to a conversation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my provocative acts is above all an invitation to discussion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">- And when did you understand that you have to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- At the exhibition in the House of culture on Nevsky, where they were exposed to my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood what is the path.</seg>
<seg id="20">If passed wave of the old liberal unofficial artists and the new, free, types of artists I failed to understand.</seg>
<seg id="21">Friends I am with the artists of the new wave, post-gazoněvskými, who got us to the "Puškinské 10", and other waves were not.</seg>
<seg id="22">Attracts me to the theatre, dress, music, all genres in addition to the words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- And it all joined in your art-clinic ...- For me it was important to find themselves in the heart of the culture Petersburg, you should gather all the best forces of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I occupied the place of the Puškinské 10, and there still existed prior to the reconstruction musical-artistic club, the bohemian club, the home of the petěrburkské of bohemia.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is spurring many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how to Šnura brought with the project "the Ear of Van Gogh".</seg>
<seg id="26">Lines and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, dressed to the chest wearing a capital trikotů, in the midst among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the band started to play live, to become the "Leningradem".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg led many programs hali-galivských times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them the Trachtěnberga, thus began his united career, basic education and training received from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - it is a reverberation of the Art Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">This way they left our workers and regular guests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I'm the hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000 was arranged survey was in the press, the special price was "People in our town".</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of the year" I was appointed I, thus ended my top.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the new times, according to the ancient rules of the work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In current years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you can be popular, but not very cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works are characterized by a recognisable manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Many of my paintings are hits, which is vividly captured the timeliness and acumen.</seg>
<seg id="39">I have the program, the exhibition "the Russian museum in klaunech".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless categories.</seg>
<seg id="41">Previously, I used to be a sociable, today is such a painful and terrible.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in klaunech everything blurred, the picks are tragika.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love grotesku, I have a grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, to save the world the way of the totalitarian disguise in nařizovacím procedure.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today people come together under the clothes, focusing on the external drive, not on the internal man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or maybe he is not shake his hand and be spit in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the fallacy will be removed převlékáním.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Recently we have seen thee in the role of the municipal organ grinder.- The cultural city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">And who would it be, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- And can be of commercial art of the beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- At the moment should be commercial, utility art thorough, tactful, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">Leads to the disintegration of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Previously, people would gather in the hloučcích, bohéma loved one, free from other people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today everything had broken down on the mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I'm not stodolarová banknote, I appealed to all.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today is the need to think, to whom zalíbíte.</seg>
<seg id="57">Today, everyone has a cultural hero of its 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- And on the Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Him come groupies, there are becoming sexually social sphere.</seg>
<seg id="60">And on the cultural soil comes 300 people and 10 thousand of them will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything wither.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have fans, the main point is that there is no one neoklame and deviate from what is experienced.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I have painted such pictures, which at one collector hung on the wall, together with the Falkem and Larionovem.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the images, which people usually ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, people often confuse the concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say:the Culture of the spiritual culture of the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture of consumer, it is elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in the examples of the artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing of images.</seg>
<seg id="68">And I am for such a culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Cyrile, what is in Petersburg lack?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- Good experts on the culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such a concept: činovník through culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">Not every one of them but can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the times of the regular tsars, it was not so in all, the czars maybe too did not understand the culture, but they understood that it is necessary to promote real experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow today are good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">For us in st. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are inserting it somewhere in a corner, because they are the need of the great experts, who rightly appreciate these experts and bring them to the right path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Today prospers vkusovština.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but the difference is that honestly say that not all of the modern art we accept, there are artists, who would have had to look for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is according to you the Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is a culture much more, there is the right soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our total) is the art of doing miserably.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural soil, but with us is today writers over readers, it is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">For us, it is such a layer is just weak.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need to make art become fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is implemented by means of a grant St.Petěrburku</seg>

<seg id="4">The caravans of the space korábů with the earthlings on board are embarking on the path, looking for a spare planet.</seg>
<seg id="5">To save the mankind, this raises the main question: how to keep your family in the conditions of weightlessness, or on the spare planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is not great.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, there are only two planets, which it is possible to acquire, even if only hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is Venus and Mars," says a senior scientific worker of the State astronomical institute P. K. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While they are but on Mars better conditions for life on the surface of Venus reach a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="10">To live there is possible only at high altitudes or in orbit around Venus... in the universe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Address issues of reproduction in the universe began to scientists with flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already half a century ago attempts were made on the plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of a pea grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.</seg>
<seg id="14">After it was done the handing down of the insects on the orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 he was sent into space quail eggs, we have verified the development of the embryo in a state of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">At the output we get absolutely normal bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then begin to problems.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem arises with the fact that this bird must find a foothold, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," says head of the laboratory of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If they don't find a foothold, birds chaotically falling and they are doing somersaults.</seg>
<seg id="20">After 10 hours there has been a freshly hatched birds to utter demise of the instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The birds have not responded to light or sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And the trouble was that, in four days just died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Twice we left to hatch the birds, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible for there to work with them," commenting on the failure of the experiment with the chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last of the "miniarcha" animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 will be experiments continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">In biosatelitu "Bion" but they will only beings of one sex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Conducted an experiment with rats, who were broadcast into space already pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="28">Basically there not discovered anything supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It was just on biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts is to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.</seg>

<seg id="30">After landing on the ground with the cosmic rats born offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">Closer to the problem of the reproduction right in the universe is, however, so far failed.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is a tough task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals at the loss of habitual environment simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">Man, unlike the animals, in principle, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens reigns abstract thinking and is able to create the appropriate emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ethical reasons are similar to the experiments performed.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the women they fly into space for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The greatest danger threatened Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">Precious thing humanity has is the woman's body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Čajka flew down and no one on Earth could not say whether the last flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether it can do after such a flight was to give birth to a child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, this question still there was no answer," says a veteran of the rocket-space industry Vachtang Vačnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-kosmonautka Valentina Tereshkova daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child was also a cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, a son was born second wife-kosmonautce Světlaně Savické, which visited the orbit twice, and that worked also in the open space.</seg>
<seg id="46">The risk, however, remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have just a few of the cosmonauts, which after long years of born and grow the health of the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Moreover, it can be dangerous even at the orbital years," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet union and Hero of Russia Valery Poljakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Mankind still must inevitably look for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a compulsory stage of the preparation for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in the conditions of zero gravity, you cosmonauts get acquainted with the habits needed to work in the open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water mimics the state of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Even for adults, water is even comfortable, but in its own way a strange environment for small children is a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that the life on the earth comes from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between the fact that the child is in an average of 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and it is then easier for them to adjust you on the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first swim, shall expire only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It is very little of it to the child something forgotten," says the instructor of swimming newborns Marina Aksenovová.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short - if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness a more natural state, then for women is more natural inevitable gravitation, the attractive force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In a state of weightlessness occurs very quickly to the deterioration of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreasing the body's ability to evict the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">We can leave the party if it will work promoters of the activity of the muscles in childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the organism of the mother push out the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And what's next?" puts Valery Poljakov complex issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If it is not on the organism causing the earth's attraction, fails to properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn in orbit is not possible to dress like an adult to a special suit with the burden, which could train.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just be deprived of what to its development unconditionally needs.</seg>
<seg id="67">"If you go into the experiment, which owns the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to the Country a disabled person, which would be absolutely nepřizpůsobená the village environment," predicts the head of the commission on bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">Once, however, the time will come when it becomes a reality and when earthlings issue in their korábech on a distant planet, which happens to be the home of their descendants born in the universe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Head of the NKU: Check švarcsystému failed through the fault of the politicians</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech republic has in the context of public procurement good controllers and high quality legislation, but lags in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview for the Library it says vice president of the Supreme audit office of the United Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the correct its application - this is what at us, in my view, the lack of", comments the current situation Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar conclusions it also suggests joint control of Czech and German controllers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the incorrect practice lists the access of Peter the weather to the so-called "švarcsystému".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS will not be entrepreneurs bother its controls - is, therefore, prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be, after all, somehow set, and if something disables, so it nor the president of the government cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to walk monitor and enforce the obligations," notes Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies are you talking about a joint project between the Czech and German party, in the framework of which was matched legislation on public procurement in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">On specifically what it was?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Regards parallel control, which we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Basically the point is that the european legislation governs the way in which public procurement address, followed by the national legislativami and then also the very practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have all of this put together, and even if the control is not yet finished, have shown us very interesting differences as a general rule, legislation is with us, maybe even "tougher and more perfect", however, the actual practice is in some parameters better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is, therefore, that it is not enough to create a still further and further more precise rules, but there is a need to devote itself to the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What you actually, this project can help, what of him for you goes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such joint control could contribute to stop efforts to the refinement of the laws, reduction and refinement of the limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Efficiency means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but does not always mean the lowest) price, in order to exclude the enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the fact that we will reduce the limit of the contracts, that we may not necessarily achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps, that is the system overwhelm such a quantity of "paper", that those who in the system they want to look for holes, so they will draw a lot easier than if the limit has remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Are you talking about domestic problems with the transfer of the legislation on public procurement into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is the authority similar to our AUDIT, or it is set otherwise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What are the authorities concerned, so as NKU there works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, just to form a slightly different way, but in principle, both the authorities proceed by analogy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has the following courts of auditors and on the level of the individual federal states - in to the system from our little different.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can control only the federal money, with us, represented by the state resources.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public means, which are managed by the county and the municipalities, there control from the level of the federal courts of auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As the legislation is concerned, it is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I would do it without the specific data I hate comparing, however, in some respects, is Germany called for a pattern, but can not definitely say that it is in all the better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It should therefore be the fact that they have a better inspectors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but I say again, I don't have such a comparison like.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to tell, that even the country, which we consider to be the pattern, are faced with a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise they would not be any benefit to cooperate with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As regards domestic legislation, as for your office marked the amendment of the act on public procurement, there are already somehow its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Due to the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is rather short, so be with us yet still in control of the events is not exhibited.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we are doing the ex-post checks, it is necessary to count with a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We see this not only in the process of preparation of the future checks - we've really hardly started our new tool "detection risk mismanagement", through which we prohnali almost 14 thousand public procurement, and we analyzed is - there are those changes course, will manifest, because they change the limits, the conditions of certain types of the tender shall be adjusted, and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The approval of this law, therefore, consider yourself more of a contribution, or other load of the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">A problem that can occur, that she rules "tighten" and will not be possible to comply with them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already for the functioning of the previous rules are controlled by individuals committed to the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the act on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It has, therefore the price of the law in this way to tighten?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think not this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want to challenge and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal misconduct, which has no impact on decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how it is thus out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us show you where the path does not lead.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS will not be entrepreneurs bother controls of the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what it means?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be, after all, somehow set, and if something disables, so it nor the president of the government cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to walk monitor and enforce the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Can say: "we will Change the law and to grant it", but can not tell, that we do, nothing like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the law on public procurement are quite strict rules as to what is to be formally done - which is right, to protect the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be the correct its application - this is what at us, in my opinion, is missing.</seg>

<seg id="6">You can put it to the readers closer to imagine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It goes about the nationwide fundraising action, that we are planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar announced on the 21st of December, at 11:10 in the morning.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally it was about my idea, then we are all told, together with our artist Jan Wales.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, that we want to collect enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want along with the public think about, what's the status once this the world we pass on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world which you buy on the www.e-tap.cz people can also support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group of The Tap Tap along with other performers also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called the "End of the world cancelled".</seg>
<seg id="16">Already today it is very popular on YouTube, you will hear also on these benefit concerts?</seg>

<seg id="17">Of course, in the very end, that is, if all of us can succeed and the end of the world does not occur...</seg>
<seg id="18">Sing it all the artists on all three concerts in parallel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hymns are suddenly connect also in a unique live on Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomas Hanak, sings in it also Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">As you are with them were given to cooperation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We cooperate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We are intensively involved in these projects involved.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them working with us are interested in and enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On what will go proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the equipment, barrier-free educational center Studeo, which already for the sixth year we with the civic association Tap in Jedličkově of the institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">For students of schools Jedličkova the institute regularly running out of lecturers and deal with them in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.</seg>
<seg id="28">By the students do not have the means to make up for the lecturers have released yourself, we try to make them do it by enabling in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the completion of the Jedličkova of the institute in the future will create a separate building that with this project we are going to pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On every concert will perform several music groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What did you pick them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We have tried to compile a program that will appeal to all ages, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and George Dry.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details you will learn to www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are you planning some similar "bombastické action" to continue into the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In may we will first speak at the Prague spring, so here you will get your interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year we would also like played at the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, when we will already in the US, I would like it mixes well with the appearance in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are not minimalist, yet have you acted, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, the group, which consists of the handicapped people.</seg>
<seg id="40">As these routes manage the logistic and organisational?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members on the electric wheelchair, its trucks have to travel in the baggage compartment, further, of course, vláčíme a large amount of cargo and crates with the tools...</seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far it always manage without any problems, CSA and British Airways to the us were perfectly prepared, that I have many times until wondered.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it has been without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks výjezdům abroad you can compare how each of the different in bezbariérovosti, public access to handicapped persons, and the like.</seg>
<seg id="46">With what you have not yet met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places, where everything works better than us, we are just in Russia have seen that on the east, everything is still in the full beginnings.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, there is still unusual to make a person on the electric wheelchair himself moved in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">Not there even such a course, such as the need to wheelchair users you prefer in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, even there arise citizens ' association, which is trying to problems of people with disabilities to draw attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And what, on the contrary, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are lots of things in which we are still behind the times...</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the improvement and enhancement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London, and in Madrid is perfectly normal, that even people with severe challenges to independently move on to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not the power of the usual, that there is a large number of people with disabilities, actively participated in social life, in that we are on the contrary with The Tap Tap a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or accessibility is one thing, but it was only at the moment of the us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things start to change really.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The band and The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's return for a couple of years back what you find in 1998 prompted to base it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I joined as a tutor to the Jedličkova institute, where I had around many young people, who were interested in something to attend to.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am myself a musician, I play, inter alia, on the saxophone, so I, together with my colleague established a focal music ring.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and over time we do it, as it says in our moderator Lada Angelovič, a little gotten out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity but came up in recent years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us, when we started to interconnect with the well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">We realized that the work, which is not seen, in essence, as though it did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions from the European union in addition, we can afford a quality teachers, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Was your goal to tighten it with The Tap Tap like this high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt the potential to do so, that they can do something differently.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness is chock-full of things, where one imitates the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">It's kind of a logical, everything new is taken carefully and it takes time.</seg>
<seg id="70">The things that are rare, there is very little, but I dare say that the Tap Tap are one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression at the man, who see us for the first time, of course, is regret, it is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the regret is completely unnecessary, because the people with the challenges are no suffering all the abandoned beings, which we regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that when something right people with the challenges, so it does not shift only for them but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Help this success, that you have a strict boss, how many people identified?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">When we want to do quality work, we need to be in many cases uncompromising and require a certain amount of discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is but I think absolutely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with my head in the clouds, and when it finds that must twice a week to go for the exam, be done on the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road, to the concerts, so there is enthusiasm quickly leave.</seg>
<seg id="79">This is how it works but everywhere, in every group, which wants to work and who wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the band has The Tap Tap twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them was in its beginnings in the year 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Lada Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, people go and come, can't be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and taste, has always door open</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 pm</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Flédě and Ostrava in the Gas tank with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech republic</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week the session of the ministers of the countries of the European space agency adopted by Poland in the twentieth member of the european space agency, as the second country from the countries of the former eastern block (after the Czech republic, which is a full member of ESA became the 12th of November, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched the close collaboration with ESA in 1994, and in the course of the next years participated in many projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the path of Poland into the cosmos to have started much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Flights into space is devoted to Polish enthusiasts already before the second world war; but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let me remind you, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw astronomical observatory, December 6, 1933 represented the ideas of its pioneering work Input to the astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thoughts of a young engineer (nar. 1905) left to the listener cool, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that the only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld in 1934, he received for the Entry into astronautics in France the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and Andre Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Vzpomenutý doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski become a world-renowned promoter of astronautics and his contribution was appreciated even by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named by his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 was in Poland built a railway trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket motor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the design is not known and not known, nor the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of trolleys or her down.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about the trolley are known only from the period of the press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the year 1933, the rocket projectiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research provided Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia, in cooperation with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the preserved materials it is clear that the research reached the stage prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of the German troops of the research was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, in the professional press discovered the proposal of the photoelectric interceptor missiles, designed by engineer Rohoziński and in the following year came out of the work Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use of the rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war all the projects of the military use of rocket techniques devoted to the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all of the work being coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activities of its activity ended the launch of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press appear thanks to the work of the Polish astronautické society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time is the mention of the company in the November issue of the year 1954 the journal Fertility, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to the astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to establish the company, which will deal with the kosmonautikou.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time already rozbíhaly projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish astronautická company (PTA) snažia for entry into the International astronautické federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn of the PTA has become a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the vice-president of the International astronautické federation.</seg>
<seg id="30">This function he held until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956 to the PTA contributed significantly to the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with the availability of 1800 metres was long about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later was built an improved version of RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 were launched in Bledovské desert flight tests of a two-stage rocket RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was a long 1,4 meters, and its weight was about 11,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Further development of the type already should be able to actual scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have a service ceiling of up to 14,5 km and its task was to monitor the elevation of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962, was another development has been suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor of the first missile type RM has become a rocket Meteor-1 developed in the years 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a two-tier, its total length was 510 cm and a starting weight was 32,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Were developed three types (identified by the Meteor-1A, -1B and-1C), which differed in the size of the area for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the rocket Meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litre, Meteor-1B on the volume of 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on the volume of 0,62 litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum ceiling for all three types was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 took place in the Aviation institute of the development of the rocket Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to give a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently have been built version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Still it is necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also in the framework of the programme Intercosmos engaged in the research of outer space on the soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 with a Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became Vladimir Remkovi the second interkosmonautem.</seg>

<seg id="1">The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week set aside the constitutional court of the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution has given rise to the public a lively discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Surely it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In its effect, this means that the various economic departments, the national economic systems, is in permanent conflict among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause is the principle of free trade and free, unrestrained movement of private capital, coupled with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The influence of the significant differences of the price of work (wages) is the price of tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept it is necessary to understand the state, when the manufacturer is trying to imports of cheap goods to compete in the competition by "podrazí" the price of a competitor to pull down on themselves a bigger share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale, it means for the majority of entrepreneurs either to translate the production abroad, or there buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is the high unemployment in countries where the price of the work in comparison with other economies high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital does not have any social responsibility and the responsibility for it produced unemployment, grow necessarily the social expenses of the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The whole situation is enhanced by the sheer unwillingness of the lords of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to replace the economic and social societal damage in the pursuit of profit has done.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to indicate a specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in individual economies the situation, when the national governments are being forced to enter into a mutual competition with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of its people in order to attract into the country of the foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments give to the private capital the mercy of their populations, regardless of the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This manifests itself mainly in the changes of applicable laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is economically forcing the population accepted the price dictation of private capital, in particular in the field of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is done both by system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, second, by restricting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase of the gap between poor and rich.</seg>
<seg id="20">In GERMANY there are already a number of years the public treatment clinics food for the poor, who cannot own work to feed itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already into the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy occurs quite commonly the case that a properly employed people receive such a wage that to them, the state must pay to the subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was published even in the case of the auxiliary staff of the bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures of virtually all of the southern states of the EU, without doubt, lead to the same state, when people are under pressure from the disastrous slump in the social level of forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or vegetate for starvation wages on the edge of the company in the hope that in the country, perhaps one day come a private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here it should be but the real question but where it comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or does not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or a Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the european wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It covers the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and media ad nauseam claim that the state is not the capital to participate in their own economy, driven economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state must control interventions to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">You then need to ask whether private capital does not affect, now actually governed by policy and by the entire state in its own egoistickém sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is a clear answer that, yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and in all the states of the ubiquitous lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation, manifested in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the legislation, where practically all reprehensible, but nothing criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In GERMANY the situation is that the state of the ministry for lack of funds awarded the drafting of the laws of the private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These draft laws are then agreed upon in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power thus does not come from the people how to preach the constitution of the western type, but from the financially strong groups preferujících own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the liberally oriented democracy is now quickly get to the situation, as it describes About in his work the Crisis of the roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey:" the State has already long been in full decomposition and the offices are occupied by the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">For bribes, illegal obtaining the grace of allah and for using stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption would flourish without any inhibitions and the people go to the polls with a pre-prodaným voice" ..."character of the people of the office at all neucházeli, so once was in the result of this breakdown of the state was eight months without the consuls".. .."Began indeed to talk about the fact that the only remedy in bad situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to choose a vigorous men.." About while the thought of Pompey, but he Caesar, which changed to take democracy to samovládu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Conclusion Just as in the ancient world is the current company based on the reckless preference for your own benefit without regard to the societal interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply the societal benefit.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now, just as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform goes deeper.</seg>
<seg id="43">Kauzalitu the onset of the fascist and communist regimes, we must therefore look for in the indiscriminate liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current state can be the extinction of these systems in favor of democracy liberal type regarded as a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">A particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elite completely ignore in the future statisícové the loss of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already witnessed along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution, at least not permanently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition, both at international and home affairs of the european level will be the government of the Czech Republic was forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore the system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted political - social reforms, which will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the citizens ' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of the private capital in the company in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="6">I don't want to think over who is in a periodically recurring waves of the killing of the culprit and who the victims, after all, today's residents of Israel, including the self-governing territory to be born into the current political situation and the onset of the violence experienced before.</seg>
<seg id="7">My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, look at it, who mainly used already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfourovy declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the countries of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is in the first instance the history of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In each epoch, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so evident is, if it were always these personality, which completely autonomously manage its actions and or whether their throne stood someone, who led their actions to advance the vytýčenému objectives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth zkoncentrováno in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and resulting power could not happen in the life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Between these astronomically rich families stands out one, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (if it still is someone above them, I don't know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschieldové.</seg>
<seg id="14">To much about them does not write.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) bought already in the 90s of the 19th century, in order to stop the merger of its name with the high criminal acts, in which the background stood and which for them has always marked the consolidation of power, increased wealth, or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against the countries, where the shares in the central bank do not have to lead or are preparing war (prior to invading Afghanistan, it was 7 countries after invading Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi was left with only four, but in the meantime, Russia automatically make them subject to the central bank of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with this family tried to resist, he died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank Rothschieldově Bank of America, began during the civil war issue its own (i.e. the government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK started to issue its own money and wanted to abolish the FED, was assassinated in 1963, a member of the Louis Mc Fadden in 1936 poisoned after what I wanted to sue the FED for the unleashing of the great depression in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars zednářem of the supreme, the 33rd degree of consecration Albert Peak.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was tasked to remove a large monarchic state units in Europe, the second should remove the colonial manor in particular, the Great Britain and the third has lead to the reduction of the world's population somewhere on 0,5 - 1 billion people (such number of slaves for their comfort and luxury of the just, and do not consume much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ekumenismus is nothing more than a front for such a solution), and the final takeover of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which a group of the richest families in the head with a Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis, and the subsequent offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are but a fake and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the FED, that there is no repeat of the crisis as the one you created in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">So, after they managed to an assassination of the heir to the habsburg R-U throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the first world war, destroyed the tsarist Russia the launch of the bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The first world war came to a sudden, militarily as well as economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (no longer needed to be war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia), and this subsequently led to a fragmentation of the central european powers, Austria, Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">For easier unleashing of the second world war left the bankers policy to create in the conflict situation by the fact that Germany impose a huge war reparations, thereby created the premise of a radicalisation of the impoverished masses, and then they had only selling the Germans sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering the Leader and the further creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play too, and played, the function of the fifth column, in the ignite a war of fire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century, to stimulate the Rothschieldové the founding of the Zionist movement, whose one branch of a push for the creation of a jewish state, preferenčně in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The already mentioned Balfourova declaration has created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, it began to occur to the first conflicts with the local arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">Second world war broke out, if Hitler had snapped off the chain, which it initially the international bankers have held, or everything what was made in the plan it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of european Jews in the koncentrácích created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the jewish state in the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948, and the like, as there was a war with an indemnity Germany off to a 2.světovou war, was the announcement of the state of Israel created the outbreak of the war of the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it is the international bankers manage to unleash, will the jewish people, similarly as in the other, the victims in the first line of the fighting, now together with the arab or the general muslim population of the Middle east.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided the people of the supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the palestinian - israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in the endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of all stood greed of individuals and their desire for global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Here it is necessary to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, podstrkují international bankers people a choice in the election solely their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, to the international bankers loyal, policy, which is doing all it can to unleash a war with Iran, which would, due to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and due to control Iran over Through the strait of hormuz, which travels 20% of all the world's oil (lock corridor is just 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In the light of what now seems the words, which stated the David Rockefeller in 1994: "the Only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their notion is the world masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world, where the rest of the human population to serve the convenience of a handful of the financial aristocracy.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world where everyone is a newly narozenému individuals implanted at birth chip, which it will make totally controlled entity.</seg>

<seg id="43">It is necessary to understand: who has the sense to let the sum digit of the beast.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Film Argo: When is the worst, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, occupied a crowd demonstrating islamist students of the american embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Laid off should be in exchange for the ousted shah Mohammad Rézu Páhlavího, which after the revolution, he fled to the USA, which have been a patron of his regime for several decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the us administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - to throw the shah of iran across the board could not afford to, because it would fundamentally threaten the confidence of the allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The release of the hostages but in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a teokratického mode, has been unable to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United states, which later was deepened by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Detention of diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, then what of the negotiations brokered by the algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their plight at home triggered a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential election of 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that America has brought a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before the occupation of the embassy of it have fled six employees.</seg>
<seg id="12">After the complex misunderstanding ended up in the residence of the canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities managed to get is from Iran, helped in doing so extravagant a cover story - went to the canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country obhlížel the location for the filming of the sci-fi long film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert on the "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, require the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To the legend was credible, talked about the film project in specialized journals, held the press conference, the fictitious production company would have had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">Details of the operation have been a long time classified, the movie comes from the memories of Tony Mendeze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleckův film is a special combination of multiple genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "caper movie", the story compelling base piece, podrazu - an example can be a series of Danny at the end of a partner.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, so alternate mood swings - on the one hand, a documentary conceived sequence of Tehran (in the subtitle sequence are shown iconic contemporary photos of the events and the way in which were the same situation shown in the film - the large differences in how they are not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, lightweight passages from Hollywood, at the with irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions-the men in suits are discussed the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, in the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleckovi is remarkable way managed to restart career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vysmívaného the actor became a respected director and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, after dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller Town (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is the first Affleckův snapshot, which is not taking place in the režisérově the home of Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A feel for the atmosphere of the place while he was among the characteristics that režisérovy older movies povyšovaly over the hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck him manifested in Epirus, where Tehran of "playing" Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the movie are taking place in the streets, in the rekonstruování of real events - the introductory sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and nepřevídatelnosti, which arise when somewhere out of the blue moving in the history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are making in scenes fake (fake staff at the tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many processes in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that narrated the story does not actually much in the film the meaning of the exciting scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully with this almost works, sometimes you to the reality of something přimyslí - there're all so elegantly outputting (the scene in which the looming crisis at the tehran airport, turn the phone call in America and chase after the runway has a pretty far fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">A weakness, but it is restlessness arising from the need to show too many processes in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in rolls hollywood associates is a very šaramantní, their character would do but deserve more space and are not in the movie by far the single.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleckův the movie as a little bit of losing a dramatic move, it is a picture, which can be monitored with a slight interest, to appreciate the implementation of even the retro style, evoking the thrillers of the 70s.</seg>
<seg id="37">Swept up but hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of the one yet somehow, living history, proof of how exaggerated are ideas about the powerful and vševědoucích secret services, but suffice.</seg>

<seg id="5">Yet while the women were in the prices of the life insurance beneficiary, because they are for the insurance company to objectively less risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Another incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can nominate the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will then be run into the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial regulation of the EU include the need to compulsory blending of biofuels in the fuel, which as a result of detrimental to nature, on the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because that contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of the slepičích cages, due to which substantially this year went up eggs.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Quality bananas have to have 14 inches</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The union apparatus often decided under the pressure of one or another business or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (as the Czech republic now even the threat of veto promotes the requirements of your bank).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby there were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality and have had to in the Union attain a length of at least 14 cm and were not allowed to report the "anomalous curvature".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The european commission will not prevented by the fact that only harmonises existing inconsistencies in the national standards, which became more complicated trading.</seg>
<seg id="14">Standards on fruit and vegetables have the EU despite resistance from some states softened with pointing out that the existing directives lead to a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in the poll can be even last year's EU regulation, according to which must be sold inflatable balloons mandatory notice, that is, children under 8 years of age may not inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU's appealed to the american research, according to which balloons are among the toys of leading cause of death for children to suffocation.</seg>

<seg id="20">Server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire voted by the survey in addition to some of the above is claimed to be and eu regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU set a maximum volumes of food stocks, which could be located on the territory of the CZECH republic in the day of our accession to the Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech republic then crossed e.g. the specified volumes for canned mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey intrigued by the idea of paying some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies to the request for obtaining a grant.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We handicapováni by saying that we have the sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We ask the European union for a refund," said the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).</seg>

<seg id="29">The european commission finally came out of the CZECH republic towards the fact that organized the tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">A subsidy for obtaining a grant offered by the municipalities, the ministry for local development driven by the minister Pavel German (US-DEU), specifically had to go to the drafting of requests for subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: a Bizarre regulation are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The regulation in the member states easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and at the same time, more efficient operation and development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts deserve rather the recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The more serious the problem is, according to experts, for example, the drawing of EU subsidies on projects, which do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of european integration, but that in the budget negotiations made by the member states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Emotions between Czechs raises even do that, as well as other countries of the Union shall the CZECH republic in Brussels to fight for the right to a specific designation of their traditional products, whilst not always in this match succeeds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The czechs, while following the six-year fight with the Germans and the Austrians protect the designation of the latter name, but the local rum, whose tradition with us back to the 19th century, had our manufacturers to rename the rum.</seg>
<seg id="36">The naming of rum may bear only products of cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.</seg>

<seg id="1">People want to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, claims Okamura</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr senátore, as a man think that he wants to run for president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I am not interested in it, be a senator or the president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If it is in our country worked without any problems, so nowhere nekandiduji.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can't watch how the past twenty years, the country rozkrádá, how the thieves are running, the people of increasing taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I did not have the ambition to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something I don't like, so I'm trying to come up with a solution, how to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I already was forty and I am an independent nestraník, I have no other choice as to how things affect, than to stand as a candidate for senator or the president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate, you've got, but soon you set off to the prague Castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neotáčíte it back to the people who you have chosen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The whole time I've said that in the battle for the Castle I will go according to the outcome of the congressional elections.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I stated that, if elected a senator, I'm going to run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal but is not a function, the function is a tool, how can I make my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, I need the greatest possible impact and what the strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the difficulty is not only this, that as a nation nadáváme in the pub at the television, but that pošlapeme anyone who wants to try to bring about change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To add the media that the man dehonestují and that you confuse freedom of speech is the freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">About me will be argued that the uplácím journalists or that I was an adviser Jiri Here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's go to your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the battle for the Castle you set out with the propositions of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and back property returns over twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To do this, you need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As president, but you do not have such a power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I, as a citizen lobbied for it to guiding been vacant for a trade, managed to push this through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, on purpose to reject the citizens lives.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nestraník I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My preference is that without the party classification and dogmas can I take something that is for our country to the best of each of the parties and apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You are rather a man of right-wing or left-wing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view to me, it seems to me that people rank the more to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me is not important, if a little to the left, or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me it is important to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">I am not interested in whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always I will support any publicly good solution, although it will propose INCLUDES or ODS, and as well so I'll against a bad idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Čertíte, when someone tells you that you are populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But nedokazujete it by what you said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create byznysplán in the company, so you also have some kind of ideal goal and vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you're trying to get closer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Someone that can be called populism, but all the suggestions that I'm talking about, already in the world of work, or about them talked of eminent experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of the parliament will remain just a password.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with you in the politics of the long-term nevystačíte.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that if you will for people to walk and talk with them, that you will be able to impose, for example, criminal and material responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I don't have another option.</seg>
<seg id="42">To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get on your side to make it through.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I were elected president, it is not a problem to organize television, direct transmission, where I am going to ask the president of the parliamentary parties, to enacted material and criminal responsibility for policy-makers, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they would eventually had to tell, why they did not want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">When will be a strong personality, which will be named abuses, can push on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president, it was to the credit of the public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the plane I say that I am an amateur, that I'm not a genius, or intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For their views and vision I try to search for allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">In politics I have only just started and for your program, I will try to get the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">Things I try to scroll itself, if it will not, for the six years I will finish, and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">A little bit of it sounds like it Didn should save the Czech republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">No savior I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that in the one person I do nothing, therefore I went about a number of well-known people, whether they would also candidates to the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went for Radim Jančurou, the one due to the amount of work declined.</seg>
<seg id="55">So I at least support investigative journalist John Lorencovou, which rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oils.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I stood with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm having second thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who went, mostly chose the representative of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we are thus only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People navolili the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="60">Yet I will fight for their vision, as for example for the direct election of mayors or governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You are thinking of establishing your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I even considered, because I don't have the time to do it, to verify the net past each potential straníka, and either I don't have money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I don't have money even for a presidential campaign, in my transparent account is only 20 thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You don't have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You are talking about property confessions, what is it yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Private property estimate of about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a plot of land of approximately 25 million, an apartment for ten million more flat for the eight-million collection of art works in about ten million, Aston Martin for the 3.5 million and the Damage Superb per million and then I have a couple of million on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way Aston Martin I, therefore, that it was my klukovský dream - I always liked James Bond, which in the car he drove, he was gallant to the women and at the same time, he fought against the wickedness and nešvarům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You Aston Martin, you have a property for 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but of your own money into it too much giving you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not too convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million to the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">This I have put ourselves in debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign, I thrust already 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I don't have any sponsors, testifies to the fact that my program is probably not of much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I do not have the obligation of the campaign to pay on its own.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign me, in principle, cover it, what will I receive senátorský salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But from him, I would nevyžil, for example, I couldn't pay the son of the English school, which is 30 thousand per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to just make money, so nowhere nekandiduji.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So you will go on doing business, you could live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Anybody tell you that these activities utlumíte?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it is not related to the amount of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, my activities, I partially muted.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the secretary of the match in the spring become my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like me was a samaritan, which will save the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I need also from something living.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How many of you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Two hundred up to 400 thousand, which I take on.</seg>

<seg id="1">Architects MVRDV are a proof that the real adventure is not only in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain - books-2 frames</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"The building of the strikes me as a cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, it is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig that goes around after the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the middle of a large enterprise, writes: "However, the house is nice."</seg>
<seg id="4">I, however, I ask, what today we need a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">All have internet, ipads and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily no one goes, or yes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, the housing estate, in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs that are not really worth the visit, hold a special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">This village with 80 000 exhibits the lowest levels of education throughout the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To this stupid situation resolved fell several years ago the decision to contribute to the education of the general public and to construct seven nice pomalovaných reinforced concrete thumbnails fictitious bridges, which are depicted on the euro banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive but has not been any substantial.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so the city councilor come to know that there is no longer the only option, how to become masters of the statistics: we must have a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas from rotterdam's architectural studio of MVRDV, master insanely courageous bar charts and the contractor funny, often even cynical buildings, adopted the thing with the usual serenity and on the competitive negotiations in 2003, he appeared with the five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the commission still stunned looking around around and cringed backwaters, vršil free Maas their presents itself size and its aktivisticky substantiated the speech ended with the words "Dear urban village!"</seg>
<seg id="14">This, then, is my proposal to the Mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later was a mountain for 30 million navršena.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of the revitalizačního of the project, which also include underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the beginning of November was a Mountain of books named the second place in "Best Library of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maloměstská grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than the post-modern pedestrian zone and the extremely ugly town hall, whose white facade you would rather expect the dairy, it is thanks to this, the richer a little bit of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">Above all, it is but now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Long way to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: the reading eldorado will under pressure cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="23">Means of the massif mountain, there is a lift, but the actual spatial and reading of the passion, you will discover when walking the control of the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">From all sides of the glass-covered interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt kabřince and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally costs racks with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We are a classical spatial configuration of the built upside down and the space for the reader, we vysunuli from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior Mountains of books is skillfully used: in the middle of the offices are situated, internet library, chess club, ecological centre and the central house of technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special pure joy are black shelves for books, which are one-panelled walls, once the parapet, and sometimes railing of the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Look, the structure and the smell of acts cize.</seg>
<seg id="33">Over the unknown construction material shake their heads even sworn architects and civil engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, the head of the project at the urban village of Spijkenisse, on the question of the magazine Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in one frisian farm one day come across a suitable waste product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands used as a basis under the roots mm fleece made from synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and time efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thin textiles last one, two seasons and then it is ripe for the ejection of the bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library was fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - then pressed on the boards of a thickness of four inches.</seg>
<seg id="40">The action of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (judas klp) turn in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 stairs to get to the top.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of almost 500 meters long wandering you in the literary cafe rewarded with not only a fantastic view of the city, but also by the Dutch croquettes and fíkusy in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">You take care of the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in the mountains of the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Gifts for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Probably you do not believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass tracts of prime project, with regard to ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heats and cools the earth's heat.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the Mountain of books is beneath the glass hatch, the sun shines inside, only briefly, and even in the sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">A wide glued wooden trusses, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as shading and capture a large part of solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">With the rest of you to advise you fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, already the new library is visited.</seg>
<seg id="52">I Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also a teacher of traditional chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even referred to as the "long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: every inhabitant of the city was several weeks ago, invited to the opening, devoted to one book of his personal fund.</seg>
<seg id="55">Should be the first full optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently comprises 70 000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has proven itself.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are completely filled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our invitation has now to a new house every inhabitant of a particular relationship.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it was just for decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">By MVRDV been more successful in the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon says identity formation.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">However young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is finally starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "the Germans have to play a greater role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstentions, when deciding on the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa by Berlin teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week the first signaled that it would vote against the draft on the observer status of the Palestinians in the Organization of the united nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, must be Germany because of his special relationship with Israel prudent.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think that will not support nor the american position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without, however, it was too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in march 2011, Germany also abstentions, when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here eventually happen NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take in major international issues is a clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is so.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that this is changing its foreign policy, from the direction of the policy, which was, so to speak, managed by the USA, the direction of German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is more difficult, that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The germans are, therefore, between the two queues.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think, in its role as the only installing themselves, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">In foreign policy, as in France or the Uk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What specifically does "normal" foreign policy of the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Shows the readiness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the USA or the european partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, therefore, the export and its relations with certain areas, need to Russia, China or the Middle east.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany are, to some extent, other than the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must have their own interests to protect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Should the economic interests of the impact on the attitude of the middle east conflict and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Firstly, Germany has a large outlets in the Middle east, especially in the states around the Persian gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, the need to be cautious, to neodstrašilo the public, but neither the elite in the arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">This, in any case plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I would not want to do but did not attribute too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">Plays it, however, in any case, an important role in the German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Harm the relations of Germany with the US, when Germany in the case of both of important decision-making abstentions, for example, during the vote on the Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that in Europe and even in the US, ruled by a great understanding for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I do not think that it was so dramatic turning point as in the question of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps for that Germany even the winners certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It signals that must be considered to be an international player and its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different views on the palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US in contrast, clearly spoke in favour of the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are between the U.S. and many european nations differences of opinion?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences existed in the wake of america's internal policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has about furtively a great deal of understanding for the european position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But due to the political situation can this attitude, of course, play a publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that the differences actually are not so great, as always seem to.</seg>
<seg id="43">When you look at the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanyahu, so Obama is not so much excited by the Netanjahuovou policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is not for Germany difficult to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that this is exactly as it Germans makes it difficult.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans would, of course, a little bit easier if there was a coherent and uniform european policy, which is currently not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">They cannot therefore be part of a broader line and must instead pushing things forward of their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">It did they do with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe, that Germany in the future takes a leading role and will push Europe to the european position.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Germany, of course, is not easy, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It was always a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">See Germany itself in the role of an important international player? He wants to ever take over the main role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany still is not used, it is still annoying, and for this country is for obvious reasons still difficult to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, when we look at the european crisis, as always, when Germany take a greater role, there will be anti-German sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="57">It's the Germans neulehčuje.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable for all sorts of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of the US in european politics now constantly decreasing, the EU, however, this vacuum is currently not used. Who is otherwise left?</seg>
<seg id="62">The germans simply will have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they don't like it, they're annoying and makes it much neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="10">Of the Gucci brand is so, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and instead Prada well advised to register Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way they are legally copied and German firms, the need to manufacturers of sports goods Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a binder with the records of the trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14 September 2010, you left one chinese company to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma. Artificial name, which citrons and at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in the copy, and violations of intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities are několikapatrové business houses in which are almost exclusively sold fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochovy cases are but different. On behalf of its clients proceed against the fact that the chinese companies have received from the trademark office totally officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="17">The chinese call it the "Bang Mingpai", an affiliate of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word is focusing on "Bang Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">This meant women who hunt the rich man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"To the detriment of trade, we need to combat it," calls on the Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand has to dilute, the exclusive position disappear, damage the image of is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for precious sample of products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the data of the company for market research at CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third-largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="25">Deletion of the offending records in the register of brands can be achieved, however, through difficult and something's worth.</seg>
<seg id="26">Management can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells about the cases, when the court dismissed the action, because vytýkaný name became after the long duration of the "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">When has the complaining party out of luck, must plagiátorovi still have to pay, because of the damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Known cases of concern and graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, lost Daimler legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, firm, which recently took over the German pump manufacturer in the concrete mixture Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">The chinese why, to this day, may use the emblem, which resembles a star Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used, blue-white logo, which was like a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.</seg>
<seg id="34">Manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forger of hong Kong and Singapore, who the famous crocodile turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">Trade mark office CTMO, although he admits that there in the year 2010 there were shortcomings due to the too small number of staff and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year is allegedly "the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal".</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of unprocessed management of objections fell by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Matched was 57 000 of these cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still waiting at the office of the still 81 500 complaints on the settlement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Something against it to take it is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is the case in China often, they are impressing numbers.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the last year was CTMO delivered to more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the brand, which is almost one-third more than the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record, and it means, that China is the tenth time in succession leads the list of new applications around the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This also applies to the number of all existing protective brands - there are a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the charges selected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simply put, this means that each login in diameter is 1280 yuan, or 160 eur.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Start against this dispute is a multiple of, as shown by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">This group has already more than seven years of fighting against the chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The germans have been canceled his illegal manufacture imitovaných of automotive parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the forger clinched china's rights to the mark Freudenberg continue.</seg>
<seg id="52">Alone we have neglected, as in Germany cannot be the surname of protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of the company Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">Trade mark office CTMO then also the objection of the munich company dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the other two instances while Freudenberg obtain rights, however the respondent in the dispute fights on this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It must be awful careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now it is a matter pending in the Supreme court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has the confidence, that the thing will lead to a good end, and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: "the Management is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the firms are having to even see a hundred year old writings, to supply evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago the company Freudenberg the ccp in vain to offer "high šestimístnou amount in euro" for the purpose of settlement of the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"From what you see, what it means for us", says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is a risk that the danger from the Far east to hit Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And in the case, when there imitators ensure unprotected brand.</seg>
<seg id="64">One chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted in Germany log designation of the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of business the group gave up a long time ago, yet managed to stave off the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It must be awful careful," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and the attorney Pattloch advises the German enterprises, that when trading with China very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international trademark law. Foreigners would rather have had "everything in any way worth protection, log in China", says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed: if the company Freudenberg in the last act of her drama with the brand succumb, then it probably will have to counterparty to pay licensing fees for own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or will we in the contested segment pushed out of the market.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It's Monday evening. In the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg tested choir Imbongi a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">Came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from the researcher, human genetics after a concierge.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every choir voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help to self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Unaids, the programme of the united nations for the fight against AIDS, it is estimated that around the world there are approximately 34 million people who are infected with the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of 23.5 million lives in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after the parents who have died of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphans after the parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found the association of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attending the school of the second degree.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 per month can take over the patronage.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees the child tuition fees, school uniforms and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-centre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means in the language of the zulu "the narrator stories" or "the one who praises".</seg>
<seg id="21">Gaseous bantuštinou fails in this space no one to talk to, just sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost ten years choir rehearsing the songs in this foreign soft speech, and sometimes it also brings back there, where originally come from: the south Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the airy distance of 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in the northeast of the kingdom of swaziland village Esitjeni, which is dependent on the power of the votes of the German corps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected with the</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">There are approximately 2000 people, some still in plain clay or straw chýších. A large part of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them have no parents, because they have succumbed to the virus HIV.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitjeni is seen in the small, the stůně throughout Swaziland: the highest rate of infikovanosti HIV, the lowest life expectancy around the world, according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">The circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland wear virus weakened immunity in itself. There is no rarity that die in less than thirty years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This village appeared corps in the common way for Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, the members of the Imbongi have seen many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but quite everything: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without the complete cycle of school education in a poor country have no chance whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="32">Initially, it still was a private deployment of individuals, which, for a few euros per year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But a year later was founded choir association "Voices for Africa", which has since cares for the orphans after the parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">To bacterial SPI belong syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent virus SPI, HIV, human papilomaviry, genital herpes or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Muňky and scabies belongs to the parazitárním SPI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to the group of the most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily among men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Institute of the Robert Koch institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">For heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which occur frequently, chlamydial infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papilomaviry.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is among the heterosexuálními adults with us extended to relatively few, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV accounted for by this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among minors with chlamydial infections occur more frequently than in other groups of the population.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to european polls, three quarters of all infections of concern to young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">For us, moreover, between minors often occur human papilomaviry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As it developed, the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of infected syfilidou according to the Institute of the Robert Koch institute of 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 of the disease in the year 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007 reduced.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 was about 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is roughly one-tenth less than the year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms drawn to sexual disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and pustules or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will remain, therefore, nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect yourself?</seg>
<seg id="57">The danger of the disease can reduce the condoms, they do not offer, however, a wholly owned protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As the originators of the sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transferred infections from the dirt and the close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, the experts recommend, in particular, in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examination.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent the later consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through patronage, charitable donations and last but not least honorářům, that the choir earns chanting throughout Germany, gather some money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total we have to Esitjeni sent about 200 000 euros," says president of the association of Annette Under.</seg>
<seg id="63">Money from Germany manages the village itself Zodwa service has announced, confident woman, who can impose.</seg>
<seg id="64">Caring for orphaned children have found shelter, for example, for some of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo, as in the language of the zulu says the old women are the mainstay of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them took a 14 orphans, give them a roof over your head and take care of it, to children attend every day in a timely manner in uniforms to school.</seg>
<seg id="67">The children that no one do not, go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman, that is paid by the association as well as two cookbooks that day to cook for more than 200 of the hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">"Voices for Africa" in addition, founded the school sewing, put the two kurníky and together with the american health organisation DOGS zařídilo that many people in the village had signed up to do an HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is not a matter of course. Even if there is disease in the whole country so obvious, all about her silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Under "because it has everything to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually pretty strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">Last an absolutist monarch black Africa, king Mswati III., it is known for its nemírným lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">This state-approved way of life bears, inter alia, also the blame on the fact that the HIV virus in the past decades so rapidly expanded.</seg>
<seg id="76">But even many of the migrant workers, who have the virus roznesli around the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Under the says that condoms are at every corner of the free, "but no one is not in use.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different - unprotected intercourse."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To at least a little bit of support cultural exchange, traveling choir Imbongi once every two, three years together after south Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, militancy, confidence in the future and self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the times of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white people, who sing songs in the speech of the blacks - such awards brings not only the mood and joy, but also already vyloudilo tears for many of the wild frontier troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children, over which they have patronage.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although this village are hard to find on the map, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than well-known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go into the Esitjeni, there is light," say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when you return to Heidelberg, which is away as the crow flies 8733 of kilometers, to dupajícím the singers in the service of the Bergheimer Strasse, you can see that the light shines here.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Ride the mountains Talyš we can call it the wildly romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">Minibus rattled along the road with many curves along the densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple peasant houses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the black forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this is the furthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here lives caucasian ethnic group Talyšů, of which not too much is known, moreover, that speaks perfectly persky and ázerbájdžánsky and the lifespan is a very old age.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The ultimate destination is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">This small town is an awesome too monumental architecture of the soviet times, which is in the picturesque mountain landscape somehow did not fit.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe come here not accessible. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku city is too cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 323 kilometers is needed eight hours, because the road is only a machine.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fabulous wealth, for which the country owes oil in the Caspian sea, come here to the countryside still have not arrived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Pilata Fatulajeva (48) however, it is believed that, in the Lerik has to do it, to become a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku in may is famous for the Great price of Eurovision - and we here next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulajeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">She is the director of the museum of longevity, about a single in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here is documented in the life of almost eight dozen Talyšů from the neighborhood, who are older than a hundred years. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the age of 136 years have fathered the child.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Controversial star of this museum is, however, seen sheep Şirali Müslümov, which allegedly was 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">Birth certificate, however, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="26">And due to the fact that the oldest man in the documents was 122 years, it seems Müslümovův the age of extremely dubious.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He was born in this area in 1805 and in 1973 he died," explains Fatulajeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">This man was reportedly three times a blessed and had 23 children. At the age of 136 said to be even fathered a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="29">Nezmýlil therefore Şirali Müslümov in its age of a few tens of years?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For many years people in Central Asia, however, heard and Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist Max Planck Institute in Rostock.</seg>
<seg id="31">"A remarkably many people a high the age of lives, and in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives an extremely large number of very old men."</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the lack of supporting documents, however, is not amenable to scientific proof of age, especially when the lack register.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day a glass of melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">But the fact is that people in the area around the Leriku live biblical age strikingly often.</seg>
<seg id="35">Currently, there are 20 people that are older than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why is living here in the south so much of aged people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh this explains the specific genes Talyšů.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director of the museum Fatuljeva on the contrary, believe, that it lies in the diet.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, the fact that just calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and mainly dairy products and many of which day to drink a glass of melted butter, is so healthy, from bromatologického point of view does not seem right credible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is it the original way of life, which keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">In 97 years on this latitude still relatively young.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzajeva, which claims that it has 143 of the descendants, he lives in a plain wooden house, which is typical for the whole caucasian region.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sitting on the ground with máselnicí, which tirelessly kolíbá.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Under one roof here lives of eight people, inter alia, one of the sons of Mirzajevy and daughter. Both are already a long time ago grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="45">Around poskakují two small children.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen for guests preparing tea, which is served in the typical břichatých jars "armadu".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">White teeth Mirzajevy form the perfect line and under the scarf hides the long dark blond braids before us proudly reveals her son.</seg>
<seg id="48">I always washed hair milk, so I looked and retain the color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I also never use the shampoo," says Mirzajeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The monthly pension for life just</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She always just what came of its own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">For all my life I've not one single time did not buy food in a supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then tells me about your husband, who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">The worst of it was during the second world war.</seg>
<seg id="55">But things have improved, when the oar took over the "beloved father" Gejdar Aliyev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Propaganda sounds from the mouth of the old woman's weird.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the cult, which makes around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In power until 2003, then took the oar his son Ilham.</seg>
<seg id="59">Old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from poverty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mirzajeva receives each month pension 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euros). It is on the local condition the amount of which can be easily make ends meet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And maybe has a right to say a long time ago zešedivělý son Mirzajevy: "Old people enjoy in our culture, great esteem."</seg>
<seg id="62">They live in the middle of a large family, you are loved, opečováváni and are happy.</seg>

<seg id="6">We need to create a transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And for that, we can do that, I am responsible before the people and before God," he said on state television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but especially the christian Copts, liberal, enlightened muslims and secular parties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">They all, yet hopelessly rozhádaní in a confused opposition, namely the fear.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fear before the "god's law" on the Nile issued at the mercy of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetic told that temporarily restrict the competence of the constitutional court and expanded ones their to "save the revolution".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But what wants to 61letý engineer, who has a degree of doctor of the american university of southern California, really save, in that they do not have the Egyptians nor the world clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">To be deprived of the judiciary power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">234 points, which stohlavé the Constituent assembly, with a predominance of islamists hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, partly arouse concern.</seg>
<seg id="15">As well as in earlier constitutions, it is said in the proposal, that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of islamic law".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what means "principle"?</seg>
<seg id="17">It was and is a matter of interpretation and can be feared that the islamists have this vague formulation and associated with it forensics free space to be used for a stricter interpretation of the sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least it illuminates the newly added section: In all matters that relate to the sharia, it is necessary to consult with the university of al-Azhar, which is the most important islamic institutions in the country with great influence on the entire sunni islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may not, but may mean that the clergy would carry out supervision over the legislation, which would be brought to justice de facto withdrawal of competence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the draft constitution is many things interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The problem also is that it has to be to continue to maintain the civil jurisdiction of military courts.</seg>

<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictatorship in military custody until 11 000 civilians.</seg>
<seg id="24">As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect the "true nature of egyptian families and to promote its morals and values."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is legally formulated vaguely, that would use this section to the institutions of the state even control the content of the film art and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">In intelligible speech it does not mean anything other than censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Indeed, no section in writing define explicit equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">But another section prohibits defame or slander the prophet Muhammad and his envoy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Unclear, however, remains, what is defamation and how will be prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: the Most smelly fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe, but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">It could be the secret of the success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a few over-ripened cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place them into the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football kits.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let this week lie.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you get a paralyzing sense of smell the odor rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is snow, wonderful views - and in the air hanging pervasive odor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is nasolený trout fermented in the water for a period of up to one year - it depends on how much you want to put the fish smelled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As it's getting dark and it's cold, starting with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet at the festival dedicated to this, to say it best, nejpodmanivějšímu eat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"If you eat it raw, and then it zapijete a aquavitu," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general", which is responsible for the conduct of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people eat small cubes fish and washed down is a large amount of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people would rather have aquavit than rakfisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Beverage can smell squish.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few pieces I'll try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it is similar to a piece of sushi, which was on a long bus trip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when it was in Norway poverty, and yet because there was a fridge, a fish in the fall namáčely into the airtight barrels with water, and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then in the middle of winter, when they were well-fermented, vytáhly and eaten - the senses is no doubt otupily alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Before a mere one of generations have been thousands of Norwegians forced to leave their land, and to search for work, while the majority emigrated to the United states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants greatly help to attract incoming great amount of work, high earnings and a vast system of care.</seg>
<seg id="22">The inhabitants of Sweden, old rival, which was not very long ago, much richer than that of Norway, flowing into the country for work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">On the rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, even though quite smelly part of Norwegian past.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the more expensive dishes in the market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come out on 9 pounds ($14) per piece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is in the global reports often lacking and it seems that most of the residents it so suits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Name Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremists, which in the past year shot 77 men, women and children, the people here still mention grudgingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, the shooting is called an "event of 22 July".</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians can hardly believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">For the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries of the beginning of 70th years of the twentieth century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason, why we are doing so well," says during the administration of plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and amazingly blue eyes represents the prototype of the alpine well-being.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We, as you said, thoughtful people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, as well as English most of the local people is absolutely impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nepředvádíme is, we don't like ostentation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway disposes of his oil-rich very carefully - in addition to a small percentage is most of the money from this sector invested in a special fund earmarked for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash threw money that they didn't, the Norwegians had a drawstring on his pouch firmly utažené.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"Until we can skiing in the winter and in the summer to go on trips, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an easygoing laughing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in the snow in the queue for something to eat - rakfisku I already have enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such a moose burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening it is stinking fish again here.</seg>
<seg id="42">A Hotel in which I live, is one of many places where is served rakfisk and dinner where guests elect the best, or rather for the sense of smell demanding fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">Here they have a connection with the live tv transmission in which there is a moderator with a bow tie surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is like a singing competition the Eurovision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What kind of score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here is our scoring, Havarde."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Echoes round of applause and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="48">From the chair falls man, perhaps zmožený aquavitem.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Especially we hope for interesting and actual changes in the field of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.</seg>

<seg id="21">Member of Olvera admits that after 12 years out of the presidential palace Los Pinos is inside the party from Enriqua Pena Nieta many expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">And rejects the expression of opposition characterizing the new president as a man without any substantial content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This is a very straight forward person, very impressed with the excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman and mainly it is the man who can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression, which has from his former governor of many people.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="31">At the time, when he was Pena Nieto governor, was in the state of Mexico murdered more than 1 000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the best case, the critics Pena Nieta say that during your term in office, has failed to adequately addressing the problem of killings of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">And, in the worst case, his leadership accuse of closing of the eyes.</seg>

<seg id="40">However, this is, as it says in the family, exactly what they had been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The state authorities to me behave as if I was the old drbna, potížistka and kňouralka.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want you to just accept what they say, and remained silent.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But that can't be right, when there have been so many errors and omissions," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The sash, which the president of the Pena Nieto Saturday receive, is accompanied by a sense of great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last six years, there have been tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised, that after the period of his tenure in office will be his priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope, that it will be the same by the president, as was the governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI Olvera.</seg>

<seg id="1">My crisis of the mexican-american identity</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of options that are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those they had gone; they resemble them hard times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that the mexican Americans are caught between the two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">At last the way to the capital city of Mexico, I barely prodral the crowd and I arrived to the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The arrow will point to one of two queues: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the second for the "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California and throughout my life I've been called "Mexičanem".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Russia".</seg>
<seg id="10">So later I ended up with the designation "mexican American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough that I mastered both sides of the conversation in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I don't have the vocabulary native speaker and I can't get rid of the accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled my american passport and stood in the queue for the "Extranjeros".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I was thinking about the moment when this week, the newly elected mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited in the White house president Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">The programme had the usual matters to discuss, when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and commerce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why is the same probability that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as that travel to the United states.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to join with the United states and Canada, and to create in the North America business block similar to the European union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto has promised, that will continue in the mexican war against the drug cartels, although did not provide any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico is the relationship with the United states complicated and full of hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never nepomyslela to the fact that in the year 1848, the United states invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half of mexico's territory to the United states.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for the Mexicans, who thinks in the range of centuries, not minutes, are the comments of the ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So a minute after the representative of the United states says something just a little bit critical of Mexico, you will hear in the mexican press and among the elite of the complaint on how Americans interfere in the sovereignty of his neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And children Montezumy off to a good start on the war path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet it is for Mexico, the real challenge of the relationship for more than 35 millions of mexican Americans living in the United states.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a lot of.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country offering the options, and others, which are not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with mexican roots live in towns and cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that in any point of our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, which was in Mexico denied the opportunity and had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than it seemed, this person fit the profile of the dark skin, weak education, the origin of the poor of the village etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not against Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though we are now living the american dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the american dream, not mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is against the United states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And outside of that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class of the us does not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">This feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look upon us as a menial race, which is not sufficiently mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is, in their opinion only on failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico neselhaly, so it never left.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we should now they did not find anything trapped behind the silk curtain, with the good life in the United states, but i still lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, in the childhood legally arrived in the United states, reminds me that between the Mexicans and mexican-Americans, there are tensions, because the Mexicans more understanding of who they are, and mexican Americans resent.</seg>
<seg id="46">Although it is a national of the United states, he sees himself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And at the same time a lot of mexican Americans, that I know of, does not feel like a part of one.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteena.</seg>
<seg id="49">You get the best of both countries, but the roots you don't even have one.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, the us is viewed as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United states are considered to be the Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And to make the relationship even more complicate, they want to get some mexican leaders and the part of the intelligence, as I have during their trip learned again associate with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">Want to mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a "makeshift the ambassadors" and imagined the mexican interests in the United states.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should say our american fellow citizens, how great is to visit the country, and to push political leaders, to establish relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">No.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is, therefore, not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And thanks to income inequality and rampant corruption and the drug violence many of us is not certain that this is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have such a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United states, as they did with Mexico before one and a half centuries, so must accept the fact that some mexican Americans still feel indignation for the way it dealt with the members of their family in substantially closer to the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we are more "Mexicans"than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles, the new Middle east</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle east?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such happening is in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual useless conjecture about who started it, it was many of the buildings changed in the debris, the killing of more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, hezbollah rockets from the Gaza strip near Tel Aviv, the israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even when it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, everywhere around them the Middle east is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The arab spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe it will cause, that their struggle will be even krvavější than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither won nor lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance it seems that currently there are not many reasons to be in optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire concluded 21 November lasted, the fight of this week strengthen the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Leaders of Hamas, the islamic movement in Gaza is ruled by since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered a defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza strip in one of the nejžalostnějších and the most populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its embedded rivals Fatah, the more moderate palestinian factions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas very well conclude that the time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">The islamists throughout the arab world have gained a greater impact, so that Hamas won the powerful and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, znovuvzkříšená regional power, which once was the closest muslim ally of Israel, are added to the side of Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering people from Hamas say that the islamic crescent encircling around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where reigns the party/the militia Hezbollah via Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can depose Bashar al-Assad, to the Jordan, where the allies Hamas to threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on the southern wing of the Israel changed the rise of the Muslim brotherhood, under the leadership of president Mohammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous, and the flagship of the arab countries, the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who in Egypt ruled for 30 years until its collapse in the year 2011, not on Hamas time.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more vulnerable to public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomacy may Hamas appear as a player, which can not be excluded nor Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the contrary, israeli hardliners come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terminology was Hamas deposited back into the crate.</seg>
<seg id="26">The israeli anti-missile system in the Iron dome proved their worth and a lot of Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The israelis can sleep better - for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the diplomatic terminology America is as indestructible as always. Many european countries also vinilo Hamas from the commencement of the last round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And mainly - Israel prospered, in particular, under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, that the peace process is mostly ignored.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even when the rockets from the Gaza strip since 2004, killing about 30 Israelis, was in Israel to be relatively calm since the suicide bombing bombers, thanks in part to the wall, which extends into the West bank, the main part of what once might be a palestinian state, and protects the jewish settlements, which are still growing despite its illegality before international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections held on 22 January teamed up with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they really ruled the West bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It will be better if we stick to the walls and praštíme is, when he sticks his head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Maybe hardliners win, but the arab spring can make their calculations change.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and in other countries, do not have Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">The israeli defense expenditures are higher than the expenditure of all its four arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new arab governments to heal its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The president of the Morsi collaborated with president Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, it is a good sign, and may mark the beginning of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also, the Israelis would be in the given situation should watch from a long-term point of view.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the arab world becoming more democratic, creating a denial of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination powder keg, which must one day in the areas occupied by Israel explode - as well as bus, which last week to burst out in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Already in the present repression weaken in the jewish state, democracy and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the arab population grows.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attack on Gaza to be held every few years for the purpose of pushing Hamas will increasingly choose to diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is what they preach reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and the following newspapers: the two states, when Israel cedes territory for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is little hope that the ceasefire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little bit of greater influence on the enforcement of this matter.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must deliver on stopping the supply of weapons into Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country, and of a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The arabs from the outside also must push on the conformity between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be for the creation of a palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer of a virtual state sovereignty in the UN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he had neglected the performance of their own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White house seems to be as reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle east.</seg>
<seg id="55">It means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Entry into force of the australian laws of ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logos and colors brands have replaced the general olive-green krabičkami with ohavnými pictures of diseased parts of the body and display of the newborn and child onemocnělých as a result of smoking their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to a variety of health warnings and the images are mandatory since Saturday, the only difference between the krabičkami brand names, which are printed in the same small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the strictest regime in the world concerning the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by the fact that this habit gets rid of its attractiveness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Relying on studies that show that when people start to smoke up to 26 years of age, is a 99% chance that do not start to smoke, never did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even in very young children you can see, that means the message to them, the tobacco companies seeking together with your product to sell," says the federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, and quotes a study, for example, have shown that children unite the crown in a log file with the idea for it to be a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and the changes will have only a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar actions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry against the introduction of these laws lobbied hard.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argued that this law will increase the trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more abundant cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thanks to this legislation the event of significant unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to bring a lot more of these products, which will be sold on the australian streets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other claims, that the laws of increased their shops.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of the company Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand on cigarette packaging of silicone is used to cover the nasty boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco has lost its appeal concerning the laws to the australian supreme court, has increased from almost zero sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that the company Zico has sold nearly 6 000 pieces of wholesale dealers and expects the new stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, it is a good deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a possible snag experts have reported the popularity of social media for this demographic group to which the plan aims.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a whole range of australian law prohibits television advertising, sponsorship of sports events and demanding that most of the vendors hid cigarettes from direct vision to tobacco marketing has moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned the internet advertising by local companies and websites, however, it may not restrict the foreign site.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you're marketing a worker in the tobacco industry and it only remains for you only this small space for the promotion of your products, it is for you as an online space unrivaled location in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the university of Sydney.</seg>

<seg id="23">We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave you the job and created this video, or that is involved in the marketing company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The company British American Tobacco Australia argues that the industry has focused on how to decide what to do with the new rules, than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has gone so far, that paid to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican republic under the attack of the new legislation - the country in the framework of the World trade organization declare that business is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly not traded.</seg>
<seg id="26">The handing down of the decision SOO is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek said that the government held talks with other governments, which are considering similar laws relating to packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country, which in 2001 has introduced a mandatory warning photos.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world of continuous connection is not so bad to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The last Day of thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, though it was our plane mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had plenty of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait half a day at the airport for the next years is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and how (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on children's development of increasingly more come with praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that for us (and our children) is a good idea to occasionally get bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">Forcing the brain to go into the interesting directions, which can promote creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And due to the fact that most of us nowadays is constantly connected to any screen, we have no chance of boredom enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Therefore, we should boredom support?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And not.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will return to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But as Peter tells us Toohey, a professor of Greek and roman history of the canadian university of Calgary, who is the author of the book of Boredom: And Lively History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact has a boring long history," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on boredom, dating from the first century of our era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The difficulty is in the fact, that has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After visiting the research literature and demonstration of the thoughts of the target group of about 100 people, a professor of Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of the "I wanted to do something that would make me satisfied, but not I am able".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom from apathy distinguishes itself by the fact that the person is not into anything involved, but I would be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that with apathy, there is the urge to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that the core of the boredom is a "distortion of the process of attention, united with a bad mood, and a sense of slow passing of time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can make a lot remind depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the professor Eastwood said that while they may have a mutual relationship, have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, sees a problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that nudíme, when we only have difficulty concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to the earlier experiment, during which participants listened to the tape, on which the person reading the article from the magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some of the group heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others hear it so quiet, that it hardly noticed, while a third group did not hear at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who television program heard softly, reported more boredom than the other two groups - have had difficulty in concentrating, but they weren't sure why, and giving these difficulties boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you are trying to concentrate on the difficult or exciting task, intrusion attention lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, "as is the search for the bad components on the factory line, can distracting music to help keep you busy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, now we know, that twist and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can in fact help with the fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that children who are allowed to wiggle, to learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All we ever boredom experienced - delayed my flight, roaring speaker, especially the lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals have a greater chance to be bored than the other.</seg>
<seg id="36">For assistance with the measurement of boredom scientists in the 80s of the last century have developed "Scale for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes questions such as: "a Lot of things that I need to do, is repeated and it is a monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time for them all to do.".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using these scales, the researchers found that boys have a tendency to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Teenagers are, however, generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991 Reed Larson, professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">Found that 32 percent of teens reported that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they are bored, when they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said that he does not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">Said but that he knows that "adolescence is the time for boredom", which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people are not being given a lot of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: "Is it for you to boredom good?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As research shows, sometimes not, because, in their extreme form can lead people to do, to undergo an absurd physical risks, played a game of chance or abuse of addictive substances as a way to relieve it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said professor Vodanovich that the problem studied for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boring is the way the brain, how to tell you, that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know the most suitable thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and you use this energy to playing the guitar and cooking, you will get it to make you happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you watch television, will make you happy for a little while, not long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your baby bored and give him the iPad, I will not be bored, but they do not learn how to itself to seize or to independently manage, said professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And, "this self-management is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child will learn only how to itself entertain, but to gain more self-control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But neither we, with respect to it should not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant rattling activities and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We accuse it of the needs of the bored even more, but boring is painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">What people actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is hard to find ways to entertain, when the noise stopped."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado there is no guide regarding the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Their Anthony Orozco, a student at the higher school and soccer player from the south-east of Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will be soon in the entire state of the legal - for the possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which he used on her smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco said that one day in September drove with a few friends in the Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansasem, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a policeman found in the car marijuana, was mr. Orozco issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment to drug use - minor offences, for which it is for each fined 100 USD - and he was determined the date of the court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They treated us like criminals," said mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In uncertain weeks after the vote, colorado legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends answer hundreds of smaller drug cases rather than on the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington state, which has been approved by similar measures, was annulled.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police department has ceased to blame the adults at the age of 21 years and older for possession of a small amount, which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the plaintiffs in conservative districts of Colorado have said that they will continue with the existing cases involving marijuana, and still accuse people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time several cities of the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains to vote on the prevention of the opening of the new, state-licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The heads of you drbou and regulators in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="14">And looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all within the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that the Colorado, whether in a good or in a bad way, is ahead of the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana, first of all, for medical use, and now also for recreation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol to the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as mr. Smith admitted, no place or the system can not do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent, according to which we could manage,"he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The washington law, the so-called. I-502, shall take effect on the 6th of December, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which still will not be a state licensing system, but the legal possession of yes.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are complicated mechanical issues, which must be in the course of this time resolved, such as how to balance the directive of the state concerning the "appropriate access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds for children or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Nowhere will not be difficult to place a licensed shop with cannabis than in urban areas, and especially in the metropolitan areas of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">November 21, sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora its officers, e-mail, in which they announced that the city of the plaintiff no longer prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each citizen of the elder age of 21, and that the police "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the municipal laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the district of Weld in northern Colorado represents the district attorney Ken Buck more stringent view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his office would continue in the prosecution of cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even if many of them are facing the other accusations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal wrongdoing, which was offences at the time when they occurred," said mr. Buck in his statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was complicated even in places like rural district Mesa, where voters rejected the marihuanovou initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest town of the district, has already adults blame for possession of a small amount.</seg>
<seg id="30">The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, this decision supports, but also decided to nezamítnout all ongoing cases of possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I don't think that I'm losing my time continuing the enforcement of the law, until it is not going to change," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 per cent of the coloradských voters measures supported, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and the legal system will never be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory response across the state have revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For the district prosecutors this is the "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, which stands accused of possession of marijuana, and local spokesman for the National organization for the reform of laws relating to marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"We spent so much of his life to the persecution of the people, that they still can not actually accept that it's legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states, which are of small quantities of marijuana, are to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on the best way to become national test cases for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Defenders and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalizovaný sales and at the same time also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still has a plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the ministry of justice, complies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and patients who are taking that attract attention, leaving the majority of the federal government shops with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in the operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While protidrogoví agents are not likely to kick down the door to picking up the small bag with the drug, it is likely that a's future enable the state of the regulated trades with recreational marijuana authorised by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former advisor in the field of drug policy of the administration of president Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several coloradských cities does not wait for the procedure of the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even prior to the election day some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new shops with marijuana, although it will still take about a year before he will be able to any store to open.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week the town of Montrose to the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and it is likely that the next week will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to find themselves in a situation where someone we will issue a license and then we will have a big federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, member of the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our village voted against this appendix.</seg>
<seg id="46">We look at it, for what voted the village, compared to what voted by the state.</seg>
<seg id="47">There's really a lot of questions.</seg>

<seg id="13">Not because of their somewhat bizarre name, or the fact that I came from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of the alleged enlightenment that was how bigoted, so barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was the senior advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I am a supporter of the Conservative party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You may ask, why it vytahuji up to now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simply because of the recent reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right from the center of the suffering this kind of persecution.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest profession in the world: medium sulphur in the area of the volcano Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four of the euro hazardují medium in the field of the indonesian volcano with their lives and health when tolerate 70 pounds of sulfur down the steep stone paths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners, who make their living exploitation of the sulphur content of the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of this each and every day fárat to the bottom of the crater, where the escape of sulphurous gases from inside the Earth and when in contact with air passes into the solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After vyseká large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carries away, it is on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets after the steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 metres, it is just 250 metres away, but vyčerpaným porter takes over 40 minutes before vystoupají turtle pace up, because they maintain the balance and thoroughly rozvažují their steps to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any stumble could become life, as it happened one of the French turistce, which years ago, came crashing down from the rocks Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each pounds of sulfur, which the winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When you are at the top, making your way around the tourists, who is photographing, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and fatigue can carry the heavy baskets to weight gain, which the mining company ranked slightly lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a business PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in the volcano profited since the 1960s and never pay their workers more than 662 indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even in the teeth of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Because they are commonly worn by 70 pounds, we can earn you about 46 000 rupees (3,8 eur) for each path," explains us Anto, which usually completes the three-way front desk.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way he takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but can you then earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even though this seems like an insignificant amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what they would have earned on the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The daily wage of the miners is here very high. For example, for the collection of the coffee is paid 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 eur)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary of 75 000 rupees (6,2 million) per day, and work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, from the serious reason, which is in Indonesia as compelling as sulphur: "I'm Married with a young girl of Bali, which is a hindu, and I took it., make converted to islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, wrong he breathes, still coughing and the eyes are irritated by toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In its 27 years Anto three times a day, risking a life in the volcano Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already started to take its toll, although my face is protected by a special mask and glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Has asthma, wrong he breathes, still coughing and the eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that escape from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price you must pay for it to achieve his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work for two years, because I want to open a business or to study Spanish or French," promises more than a passable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This sympathetic and intelligent young man stižený fate could be a tourist guide, the waiter or with the concierge at the hotel, and instead of doing the work of the media.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shares dirty wooden shack with other medium, and every day he gets up at two o'clock in the morning, because of the sulfur in the night continues to bubble and its characteristic yellow color is changing in blue and September of darkness.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the surrounding darkness pharaoh Anto into the crater and illuminates the way a small lamp, which has mounted on the helmet itself it for your money bought.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 media yields on the shoulders of the basket with the sulfur from the bottom of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has a high income, the extraction of sulfur due to cost savings nezmechanizovala, or provide to the carriers working on their own and with such zeal, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually even do not receive a share from 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the extra charge for the shooting, which, together with a ticket for 15 000 rupees (1,2 million) collected by guards of the natural park from the tourists, who come to enjoy the pictures taken volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the cattle, and not for the people," he said Madrusin, hefty 42letý carrier, which works in Kawah Ijen the past three decades, from the moment when he left the school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Can handle the lift up to 110 pounds, and he assures us that the last work, "as long as it will go," because he needs the money on the education of his three sons, aged between 18 and 10 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not go into retirement, I was going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulphur throat burns and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches hold of the miners in dense výparech, which from the volcano are based on, the miners are so tough that no one of them does not complain that they suffer from serious illnesses... it is, however, evident from their frequent respiratory troubles, arthritis, pain in the knees and ran on the shoulders caused by the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Unainik, which balances its basket on the back, you in its 53 years may deal only 50 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his colleagues vydolují in the volcano 15 tonnes of sulfur, which then three trucks by the steep path between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari distant 18 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I will not go into retirement, I was going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life," he declares Unainik and opens while the community at large mouth, in which missing a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of his five sons, the oldest, the thirty-year, also earns mining of sulfur.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The key issues</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and a graduate of the field of Education and teaching, has considered, that to children and adolescents in the social networks of correctly understanding of the situation, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is reported that: "the Internet was created as a means for finding information, but when it appeared the social network, has changed the rules of the game."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová notes that the academic Marc Prensky, graduate education at the university of Yale, and the author of the article, the Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to this phenomenon explained.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We are digital immigrants, who need to learn, and in doing so themselves only we learn," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that it is a complex subject, "because we ask them to rozeznávali, what is appropriate to disseminate, publish, and say, and what does not, at the age, when the are not yet ripe".</seg>
<seg id="46">Also, to be - what concerns surrounding - sober, at a time when what most eager to be favourite, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences", he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to this specialist is the most effective way to children and adolescents to show you what it's privacy, asking questions, which is forcing to think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Telling them to do something they have not got, doesn't work," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there Are things that you unknown person nevyprávěl, so why are you doing this on the internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: would you, if anyone has posted your picture the way you posted the feel?</seg>
<seg id="51">You know, what about you other published?</seg>
<seg id="52">When označuješ of the person in the photos of the celebrations, asked you the following persons for permission?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more: the Need to constantly we all know, just what are you doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The next point is to realize that they must behave in the internet environment as well as outside of it.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"The man is outside of the internet governed by respect, morals, and other principles and the same it should be on social networks," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Supervision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at the first instance and the educational advisor explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networking.</seg>
<seg id="59">"If he understands the intricacies of every, have a good basis to make with the children talked about the consequences of that opening the account on the internet can have.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, with regard to the age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the result of his test: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if to hit me a flash of lightning," tells in the memories of the moment of truth, whom the doctor tried to "a little bit of ease", but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">Boy it before the family enthusiasts held.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his illness itself on their shoulders, and started on her informed. And with such commitment that has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is no doubt one of the nejdávnějších patients Units of HIV in the Civil hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in the year 1994 after several battles with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early ' 90s, when there was a lot of doubt, a few treatment options and greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, with him, nor the director of the clinic of the Mexican institute of social security (IMSS) nerozloučil, "because he had a cutting blow".</seg>
<seg id="9">Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible with this syndrome survive and to live.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is a lot of persons that their illness does not know and come up when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and vysílil the immune system, and are becoming then the victims of random infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years from the time, what in the world discovered the disease AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a big success, that the length of life of the patient, which in a timely manner and in an appropriate way starts with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in the Civilian hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information has been confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and a specialist on HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to conclusion, that since 2008 AIDS is not a judgment of death, but that the length of survival and full of life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients, which is a disease is diagnosed, while the better are those who are taking drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that anyone who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with treatment to live without any problems up to 75 years", he explained in an interview with the doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To underline the importance of this progress, it is appropriate to recall that the average length of life of Mexicans is now 76 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate in recent years has significantly decreased, and in the case of Mexico dropped the number of people who have died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in the year 2011 (the yearbook of the Joint united nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that from the discovery of AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the state of Jalisco have died in 2011 255 persons and in may of this year, so far 187. However, from the year 2005 is to ensure universal access to antiretrovirotikům.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why continue to people on the consequences of the disease die?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This way I see it, this is how it happens with us in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least for the last 12 years we have not used the stock of medicines. The problem is that the patients come in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds a compelling indication: "Nine out of ten patients comes, when it is manifest any associated infection. The only thing you need to do, so that we can more impact on the overall mortality, the disease before diagnosis, and therefore it should be a large-scale offer tests to detect the disease to all persons who request them".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincides with specialists and officials from the State council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to let it do the tests to a private lab just because they did it its mate, and despite his young age he had already erupted disease AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Judgment approved by the court of appeal of the United states, which does not recognize the debt restructuring of the company Grupo Vitro provided for bankruptcy in Mexico, raises the ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Thus, it appears that the processes of the restructuring of companies, which allow the mexican laws in the country of stripes and stars in defiance of international agreements do not apply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The approval of the judgment of 15 June last year by the judge Harlinem Hal with the bankruptcy court for the northern Texas leaves in the practice of mexican companies without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the judgment opens the main mexican manufacturers of glass doors to the Supreme court of the United states with an appeal against the three irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">At the outset, it should be said that while the judge of this initial claims, the creditors shall manage the insolvency law of the United states, the court of appeal of the Fifth district is based in New Orleans says that the main procedure sets out the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Firstly, it should point to the ignorance of the international process of cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational enterprises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In essence, was created for this purpose the model law of the United nations for the unification of international trade law, which determines the arbiter of the organization of the American Law Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Second, the judgment provides that, without a vote of the branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognized by the debt of the parent company Vitro against subsidiaries, would not have been reached by the majority required for approval of the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, this option mexican laws admitted.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fact is, that the case of the company Vitro was not the first, which was adopted this scheme.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is a half-dozen of examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts vouched Federal bankruptcy institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, it is true that even after the deduction of the votes of the branches of the creditors - who against the company Vitro stood by the court in the United states, i.e. the funds "vultures", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - have not reached majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In a vote would have reached about 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This figure the court of appeal does not take into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another point of view blames the court company Vitro out of a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - on the background of the serious economic crisis that hit the United states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the family-owned company González Sets lodges an appeal for a new consideration by the court of appeal, to the examination was carried out with the full participation of, and thus for the participation of the five judges, because originally voted only three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">If he fails here, it will require as a remedy, the revision process of the higher instances, in this case, the Supreme court of the United states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case is serious, that the court failed to document sent by the mexican government as a department of the amicus curiae, in which is described in detail the procedure for the company Vitro in the framework of the Bankruptcy law and in which he points out that the company you eased by the fact that the move to the agreements signed by the two countries, that confronted the act with the provisions of chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy code of the United states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Navícse points out that the country complies with the principles of the Commission of the United nations for international trade, that is, to comply with the rules defined for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for borrowers and lenders.</seg>
</p>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was with this sálovým sport linked more than 60 years and has travelled through him the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in puerto rico has such a variety of memories in the history of the local basketball, as has Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Reyes was before him in 2008 caught stroke on the wheel chair, fired into the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player under the age categories, the player of the national basketball league BSN, the owner and the coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or the president of the puerto rican basketball federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I held in the course of your life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, as if I was in the 90s of the president of the national league BSN, the general manager of the national team and the president of the federation," he recalled Reyes during the visit to the reporters of the newspaper Primera Hora at home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball has been my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes in his assertion does not exaggerate.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenir items from his long career, is a witness to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart of the</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the greatest emotion of all the guards ones that remind us of its activity in the los Vaqueros from the middle of 50th years, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time, celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or the owner of the team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"It was my best summer, that I most enjoyed, because I had the opportunity with a team of los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in the eight championship, whether as owner, co-owner, or a coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I have one championship bid farewell - in 1981, when the BSN debuted Jerome Mincy.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the team took over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"I remember that Gene Bartow, who has previously coached and at that time he worked at the university of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me: "I have for you handsome dvoumetrového players.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want him?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And it was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players that ever puerto Rico should.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow me then recommended a point guard Raymond Gausseho, which became a member of the team and one of our best striker of the championship.</seg>
<seg id="19">I recall, that said, that if Mincy will bring Bayamonu victory in the championship, Gauss then will contribute to the further."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Championship, when for the team to los Vaqueros played Gauss, enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988 already, he served as the president of the basketball federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time wanted to dedicate its functions and enjoy the Mincyho location in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"I remember how we first defeated the United states in the qualifying olympic wrestling in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the world cup in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we had to have a bronze were it not for the canadian referee, who left us a repeat of the final face-off," said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Is a team of the world cup in 1990, the best national team, which you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the national team in the Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and vypráskali we are a team of the United states, which was very similar to that of us vyfouklo bronze at the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were youths (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who couldn't be in the team in 1990 due to the injury of the knee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which may not perfect composition, but managed to us to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the olympic qualification in 1995 in the argentine Neuquénu.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the players on the roster, as were the "Canito" Nieves, Pablo alicea on and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the player excluded because of a skirmish in Panamerických games in Mar de Plata, we, despite all the predictions have won the gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What was the best player of the puerto rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His numbers of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one from puerto rico reached at this level such results as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to mention its effect in different leagues, where he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best portorickým a coach?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very hard.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good generation to which they belong Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the young to me very much like the work of Leo Arilla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">That your success in the federation is the biggest?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">That I was a part of the most famous era national football team in the years 1988 to 1995 and at the beginning of the 90s of the national league BSN in one season to 17 teams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> What you failed to prove?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Were the things that I wanted to introduce, as a division of youth categories according to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that the guys from Ponce played only in their field and vied with teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-off.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now children travel a lot and play too matches, which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">I also see the benefits in the mandatory certificates, and courses for coaches, assistants of the judges and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">It makes me happy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What now are you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The most I listen to music, I look at the YouTube video with the music of my time, I enjoy grandchildren, and sometimes I go to the basketball matches.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, I am enjoying the company of his wife Isabel, who was always by my side.</seg>
