<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican Party against Obama's re-election strategy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders have justified its policy of necessities in the fight against electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennan's centre, however, a hoax calls the myth that the electoral fraud in the US is less common than the number of people who die after lightning struck.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, for the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures will undermine the american part of the democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike in Canada, the US responsibility for the organisation of federal elections in individual states.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in that spirit, most american governments since 2009 promulgated by the new laws, which make the selection process, or to register on the electoral roll.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has boomed after elections in November 2010, during which the added 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, only for the year 2011 to 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those laws also limited periods for elections in advance, the zneplatňují right to write a list of voters in the election day and taking away the right to vote of citizens with the registration of a criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006, a voter-půkazu identity with a photograph of any U.S. state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first state that this requirement was introduced, Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutionality of indianského Act confirmed in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican offices bustled with the extension of this procedure, as well as other countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the past two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states in order to force voters to present identification with the picture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, unlike the Quebec american citizens do not have universal identity card, such as health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, owns 11% of american citizens, i. e. 21 million people aged allows for the vote, no photo ID issued by the government in their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Also has an identity card about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">The acquisition of the identity card, often costs more than $100.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting mostly young, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years, therefore, does not have the required photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, who are known as the voters of his shift to democratic candidates, in several states are entitled to use his identity card with a photograph of his school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect rather republican candidates, the cards issued by those clubs in the election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, require no state election proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such requirement introduced Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011, has about a dozen states laws, which requires voters to prove that they are american citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">Obviously these measures aim to limit the number of votes from the hispanic community.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was noted that two of the three hispanics prefer democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators in 2011, supported in eight states laws, which removes the registration of voters on election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition to limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to the voters, who want to write.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those restrictions have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaigns for the registration of voters to register of approximately 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken after 2009 but caused the decline in writing new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican legislators, then in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008, Florida accounted for 33% of african-american voters, who voted in advance, although african american voters in this state was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">For Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">Made just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens of the voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, the whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Against the approval of the laws, which restrict voter registration, of course, very strongly built democratic lawmakers and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors have blocked his veto of a few bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">With a view to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">They have managed to limit the damage in part.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, laws requiring the presentation of the identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly introduced rules but undeniably difficult in 2012 in the exercise of the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics speak mainly on the bias approved laws and consider these apparent desire to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report from the Centre Brennanova 2011 shows that states, where these laws were approved, 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain already: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures will undermine the american part of the democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">The detection of prostate cancer: tests or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The test of a dog brought some bad results, which were wrongly negative or even positive, which led to unnecessary medical.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of this has increased the reluctance of the men, who had been so reluctant to investigate all go.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let the exam or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked for a view of two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the US have shown a high degree of contamination between the different groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Further studies, this time, found the mortality rate among the different european patients undergoing testing, and those who had to go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also showed after 12-letém apart, that those tests, have a 30% to 40% higher risk of metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore recommend tests from 50 years of age or from 40 years if your direct relative had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Risk group are also men of african origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision when the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive types of cancer and such species, which are unresponsive.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to properly explain the patient risk his type of cancer, to offer him a possible alternatives, not necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which does not have a long-term impact on the life and focus in these cases, rather than to the active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men, who was diagnosed with cancer, cure, since their type of cancer is aggressive and threatening them to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Design them instead of active surveillance, and in the case of the progression of the disease by providing them with the treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater accuracy set criteria, which help to deciding which type of treatment and who does not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Still, therefore recommend testing.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to go through an interview with the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo testing or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International urologickou company created Movember movement tool that allows you to assess for and against in the context of the examination of the dog.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Disease prevention</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite progress in research seems to be the best means of reducing the risk of the disease of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all healthy eating and sufficiently moved, it could be prevented by up to 30% of cases of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="25">`` If they stop smoking, this figure would be increased by at least 50%, ''underlines André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancer-causing inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">A percentage also remains completely uncorroborated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the canadian company for cancer research remains a priority in the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are also a risk factor for several others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It's extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">`` Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers, ''she says, shaking her head spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data: 10 years after the smoker to quit smoking, decreasing the risk of cancer death by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The mass</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Well-shaped and obesity are under the SCC additional risk factor for the incidence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">`` Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon, ''says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommended to reduce the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">At too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of kolorektální cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is appropriate to avoid even the sausages, for the same reason.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Preserving meat smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">`` They can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer, ''says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent times, the various scientists focused on the connection between vitamínovými additions and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But research has not yet yielded definite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are under the SCC contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although one of them to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks rather on the increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even the effect of vitamin D for cancer is clearly shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">`` To undergo testing does not mean that you have cancer. ''</seg>

<seg id="1">Higgs boson explored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The notice on the likely discovery induced Higgsova bosonu last summer, a legitimate excitement.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all matter in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And on the last particle, which predicts the existence of the standard model-our best or the `` least bad ''explanation of the nature and the behaviour of matter-but which has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Scientists, however, there is not yet 100% certainty that the Higgsův boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">No doubt about it, that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgsovu bosonu, as predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">New data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto, it rather confirm, however, all data, so that we can have absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, assume the Higgsův boson, because the risks of error appears to be small, and take a look at what's happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world quite definite law, under which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule can not bypass-and to try too hard, otherwise they will hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although the particle physics is very strange world, it also shows that it is like the law: Pauli ratio principle, under which the two can not occupy the same space particles at the same time, if they are in the same `` quantum state ''- this `` status'' roughly, creating some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, the particle physicists are divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, we will find the good citizens, or fermions, dutifully comply with Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end of the range, the mean-spirited bosony anarchists who appreciate anything-certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way a perfectly), which is the Particle Adventure, laboratories, Berkeley: mesony, here we go unnoticed, and `` force ''particles, which are spreading large natural forces and which is the higgs boson probably related in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It should, however, say that these bosony are so exotic pets, how it would be possible to believe.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you read this article, it's because bosonu with unusual banality: the photon, or `` particle of light, ''which is `` carries the electromagnetic force.''</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when the particles with electric charge accelerate or change its direction, `` disturbed ''by the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into the pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This `` interruption ''created an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon-and thus one of bosonů, `` right force''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">But it's also with Higgsovým bosonem, only that `` disturb ''should be the other field, the Higgs field, that this boson appeared.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite must be achieved very high energy values, as with the frozen surface of a pond, already ripples just a lot of a large boulder.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is used as a huge accelerator as part of the accelerator in a laboratory in the CERN Large Hadron Collider with welcome volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Analogies with the electromagnetic field we again suits to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and stuff.</seg>
<seg id="25">With the electromagnetic field respond not all particles or all materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do so, but no other-a piece of paper, for example, he will never be alone to keep in the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And anyway, with Higgsovým field to respond to all particles: that is, they have a mass, while the others (such as the photon, let him have it.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Miss Smith asks why all these surveys are, `` bring us? ''</seg>
<seg id="29">From the point of view of science for confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any inconsistency between the observations and predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many physicists, moreover, literally, wants to find them, because the slightest difference could open space of the `` new physics ''and close some of the gaps in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">To say that the model is still a major, no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which consists of approximately 80% of the space matter (oops!).</seg>
<seg id="32">The device CERN, however, until such contradictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Responses</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The response of these research in the day-to-day life of Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, however, would be a mistake to assume that it will not be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Behold: at the very beginning of 60 years at Bell Labs laser pioneers had no idea about the revolution, already in their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Anticipated scientific uses, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">The physicist Willard Boyle-who worked at Bell Labs, where it was invented in the 1960 s, and which created the first permanent laser beams were pulse (previous) in 1962, I have already said-the laser was initially considered a `` toy ''in a lab.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine …</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides, it may also result from all the instruments that surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though that Boyle at first, so plan now serves as the `` eye ''of all digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC will necessarily change my life, however, this means that no one really knows …</seg>

<seg id="3">The debate should be about to continue, and at the same time to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this crucial area remains to do a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="5">The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in her apartment in Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer that was consuming him, gave him a two-year suspension.</seg>
<seg id="8">`` They gave me five years of life, and it's been seven, ''he says without emotion on his bed in the house for the palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">`` But it's still a shock, that you can not prepare, ''he adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease had done their work: the extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself to the bathroom or feed himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Resignation is looking at a tasty breakfast and agrees that it will help him to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a brave and he even smiles, talking to strangers, who had stopped, his medicines, offer a bath.</seg>

<seg id="14">`` My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, that degrades me, ''she says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his drug problem.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">`` Throughout the life of one learns that guys pee standing up, ''says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the establishment of Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">To return to the stage for some people, the child is an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>

<seg id="31">In Québeku seems a bed palliative care at 11 700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's very little, if we realize that we are all gon na die.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">`` Half a year, there is always a three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years, ''says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% of hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">They say that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i. e. the care, which is intended to ease the suffering, as soon as the sick person comes to the final stage of his life, whether it's at home, in a hospital or nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the company for the palliative treatment of Grand Montréal, specialised in more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And just this crucial non-availability of health care in Quebec, leads to a number of doctors specialising in palliative care fears the adoption of the law on euthanasia and asistované suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is circulating in the manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec healthcare system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to high quality palliative care than it will be possible to agree with the execution of euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, has recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on standby in great pain, without anyone made the necessary steps to her.</seg>
<seg id="52">Fears for patients to ask about the killing, on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, a number of oncologists and caring patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, when she left the intensive chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my onkoložce, finishing with treatment, she said that she regrets that do not fight, tells us.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is the all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to its ošetřujícím doctors for their wishes to fill them, as a team of palliative pussy eased the pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it is to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care in society for domestic palliative care area Grand Montréal, patients prevent pain therapy in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life often doctors use paliativní sedate the patient sleep until the moment of death, whether in fits and starts, or whether his sedatives administered permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">You can not pretend that this part of the suffering of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="63">The patient, who get rid of pain, will have greater access to the paliativním sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">The sick, which is given a sedative, always say the same thing: `` I want to die. ''</seg>
<seg id="65">But it was not necessarily mean `` I want to provide the euthanasia '', it means more to me, `` I want to get rid of the pain. ''</seg>

<seg id="14">Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that each training is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it follows that the player as I have felt more like a team and wants to make the maximum power.</seg>
<seg id="17">And furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in the context of my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">The hand has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And Ancelotti has the word at the right time?</seg>

<seg id="27">I had had a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust which gives me, is another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How do you see the first part of the season, PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 1 st league us Lyon took the lead position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But staying in tow.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League: very easily advanced into osmifinále.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What's your club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be for high-quality european teams tough.</seg>

<seg id="39">The budget already has …</seg>
<seg id="40">The Paris has become a major european club, to win the title and to make history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, it is not yet.</seg>
<seg id="42">The financial website has PSG funds to this intention did take place.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a big failure in nezvítězit 1. the league as last season?</seg>

<seg id="50">Usually, with 79 points are clear master …</seg>
<seg id="51">But another club, Montpellier, had the season even greater.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think that this year, it will.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the title, seeking even great teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have a weapon to defeat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect from us a view of what we invested and we have the players.</seg>

<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, who had a second season had osmifinále, while also invested large amounts of!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the sums invested, one might have expected that you will have in front of the other 15 points ahead!</seg>
<seg id="66">That insult the other clubs and the french league.</seg>
<seg id="67">The clubs, Lyon and Marseille, in last year's season, too, with a new PSG shifted into a new phase.</seg>
<seg id="68">It shows how 1 League is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that, in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as if the PSG in relying on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that he says that there is a `` dependency on Zlatanovi ''.</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful, and it gives a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">I lost, and demonstrated that the star is 1 League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he has demonstrated that it is a big player, a global star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our team we respect the human and the player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He respects the people around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What it is, is really remarkable.</seg>
<seg id="78">This led others to increase its own level of the game.</seg>

<seg id="91">The coach chooses the top players, is nearby and can get for the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">So was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want them to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has reached his goal that we qualified for the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps lead our team to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">It's a draw (1: 1) from 16 October in Spain with a solid starting the match?</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanks to the Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">All the negative impact of the current financial transactions based on central banks identified transactions and the cost of processing among the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="3">As part of these technologies, often the truth, there is clearly feel the political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Bitcoin inventor's Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), as a virtual money (transferable, however, dollars, euros, …), so the secure transfer protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered around 200,000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand websites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kurz bitcoinu first peak $30 (23) in June 2011, five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today was moving about 10 dollars (summary of courses at bitcoincharts website. com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products that nothing is impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) on this fact interested in its report on the virtual finances, which came out in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin describes as `` the most successful virtual money '', `` konkurující the dollar and the euro ''and `` the equivalent of current money''.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin from other types of virtual money vary them as `` credits ''used for the procedure in the video game, which one gets the game or which may purchase (and sometimes back exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Every month, but the central government controls and processes individual communications.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoinu are all network nodes Depositary book current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How this network works?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users is, in fact, between two electronic addresses by e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file is also possible to ensure that all exchanged bitcoiny existed in a public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A crucial phase in writing this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">Using a mathematical task is to resolve the computers, which grant, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a phase cut file; i. e. on the transformation of a file on the haircut and a unique digital print.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers `` take ''this new transaction and added to her number, then the whole `` cut''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find the number, which provides specific fingerprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number, the other nodes easily checked his accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transactions are then indestructible displays connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would lead to a change in print.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wanted for fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly (10 minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions-the second to be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to avoid inflation, shared this remuneration regularly two, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, however, they can share up to nine hundred million, so the room for the margin is here …</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the task is also increased with the growing level of calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network has had its downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Website for Bitcoin provide services, were attacked and the alienation of stored bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="35">`` The opening of the protocol, ''says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, the company for payments for real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also controls the potential money laundering through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this problem is also true for cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like blogging platform WordPress, adopt them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů orbiting.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November were launched `` huge discounts. ''</seg>
<seg id="42">`` It was a change of thirty thousand dollars, ''says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaged to bitcoinů gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching of the book on this money, has a great deal of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, the Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu pay phone, but uses the system for verifying the Bitcoin transactions, which are due to be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">Holder also manages its identity and so can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to be set in the traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just tell the address, which can be a phone `` photograph and recognize, ''explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to the systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">`` Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the 2013 could be decisive, ''predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In its report, the ECB also foresees a re-evaluation of the various risks, which are now considered to be elevated, if this kind of money will be successful.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The difficulty of the work on the egyptian constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Mohammad Mursí turned to another poker.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided over the declaration of the Constitution, which temporarily grants unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the views of all the other day that the Constituent Assembly approved the final text.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago granted a head of state to the House for a further two months to complete the necessary work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For nearly two years, Egypt, used a makeshift text, which was often supplemented, which undermines the constitutional stability of the country and leads to a legal argument.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative will only further strengthen the ambivalence of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the point of view of the opposition to the president remains in its `` autokratickém delirium '', `` violates its word ''and `` trample on the right.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His supporters, however, assert that the means, how quickly turn with the constitutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">In two weeks, there should be a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way of again achieving national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rocked by protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">As confirmed in an interview with US Weekly, Tim, Muhammad Mursí appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the egyptian people with an ultimatum: `` either approve my text, or have unlimited powers '', which otherwise would have after the approval of a new constitution to end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this special atmosphere yesterday 85 members of the Constituent Assembly approved the text with a large majority of islamists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, not long before the publication of the Constitution, slamming the door with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to make their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Defenders of human rights, civil society or religious minorities in their step.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 persons from among the replacements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few dispute that day around … an hour for prayer, when some members of the Committee argued that the clock in the boardroom are not properly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text voted yesterday evening, consisting of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The subject of the limelight, article 2, remains at the same version of the 1971 constitution, and provides that `` the principles of sharia are the main source of law ''.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi party, for which the introduction of islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term `` principles ''the term `` rules '', which would allow the stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, again, the fact that this article was corrected, a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">`` Hypocrisy '', say the liberals, who sees it as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, because the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Focusing in particular Article 220, which confers al-Azhar University in an advisory role, in particular for the control of compliance with sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pommierové it is disconcerting, because `` people summoned expressions are chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see this as the beginning of theocracy. ''</seg>
<seg id="32">Liberals fear more stirring up the fact that the next president of the university should be less moderate than the present.</seg>
<seg id="33">`` For the moment, there was no particular religious result.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the Constitution, Egypt remains the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university officials, many of them trained in french schools, ''tempered by concerns about Alexis Blouet, who work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">Agrees, however, that `` there may be differences on the interpretation of Article 220, because it used terms belong to the religious.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a particular reference to `` fiqh'[islamic jurisprudence, red].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may occur, the question of the extent to which the civilian judges are competent to express themselves. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday the agreed text is in addition to the religious site very criticised because of the enhanced powers granted by the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction compared to the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another controversial place: the powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the leaders of the army will not be the verification of the defence budget by Parliament, but the National Defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Further, he will not be in the military court banned the proceedings with civilians, as requested by the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">These associations in connection with the text, which is directed against the freedom of its misgivings.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult continues to be disabled, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">No article in addition to address the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">It's the only positive point of the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was mentioned in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the egyptian president had last night in a televised speech, this afternoon's rallies are planned.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state will manifest on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan Turkménie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On 1 December came into force in law, under which each migrant workers will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yet this rule applies only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and local economy, lifestyle, and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">The FMS, however, promises that the time will be the appropriate tests obligatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The tests, however, will consist of linguistic knowledge, but also of russian history and the foundations of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language, it will also be necessary to confirm and extend to obtain a work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">This law, not even the people who successfully managed to reach the attestation and obtain academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits, the conviction and the protection of rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network test sites will work under the auspices of the Institute of Puškinova russian language, University of friendship between the peoples of the Moscow State University, State University in St. Petersburg and other russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants can pass tests in all cities; today in Russia is open to more than 160 such centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to promote the introduction of testing also supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, human rights defenders, many in the press to ask the question: what in fact it will bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes to know the language for the Russians and the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, the representatives of the migration service will enable it to reduce the number of people who have suffered as a result of the `` slave labor. ''</seg>
<seg id="20">Now many people talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the board of the FMS Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only system will allow organized recruitment from 90% to solve the problems of the foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise for immigrants without the profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the knowledge of the language - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Sebelev says with conviction is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with nepoctivými people who, under the pretext of assistance to ensure `` the removal order ''into nightmare, cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, languish for months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>

<seg id="28">Less that many citizens of the central asian republics, who intended to go to work in Russia, recognise that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to get to, but they do not have the experience, even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it's not their fault, but rather a disaster: very few, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks, can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">`` Their families need something also feed the kids, not to mention the fact that it should be a decent dress, shoes on and equip the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children grow into productive age, must be at the first opportunity to go to work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to hate.</seg>
<seg id="33">`` You feel the humiliation and inferior. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that, with regard to the law on language tests indicate the defenders of human rights on the one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If it is not, so they will not pass exams, or do not get another official job.</seg>

<seg id="40">The reason-bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the money-laundering: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the false registration can be obtained quickly and just one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the russian police know that we are essentially false documents, without authorization, of cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">`` Require a hundred, two cigarettes, tea, ''- he shared with reporters about his experience, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="45">`` Well, do not be stingy, buy a painting. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the validity of the law on the tongue, they found that the false documents are not only of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="47">Employees of the FMS already confiscated several fraudulent certificates of completion of the linguistic test.</seg>
<seg id="48">Falsified documents are printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners have free: each of the migrants in the hope that he will facilitate the problem with the judge tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times higher than the amount of pre-requisite official test: it will become a migrant workers three thousand roubles.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the last few days in America, a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets company Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as the `` McDonald, ''``Burger King,''` `Taco Bell,''`` Wendy's'' and `` Kentucky Fried Chicken. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave transformed into a wave of nine, or whether she is destined to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This whole share support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the humble, rank-and-file workers receive ​platů at Wal-Mart and the systems of the fast food, the aim is to achieve the organisers of the protests in the creation of their unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently this economic sector virtually untouched odborářským movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called `` Black Friday '', when America struck an orgy of low-priced sales, by millions of people and, in some cases, is accompanied by brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some staff company Walmart, in which the world is working on the 2.2 million people abandoned their workplace and demonstrated together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals chains, which are intended to be people from the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells around the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores are in an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">So many low-wage workers' stores in Walmart purchases only in his work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and the range of goods made from a chain of Walmart, one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of the critics, he can not afford to sell their goods Walmart so cheap, partly because few pay their staff.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic or manual scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators on `` Black Friday ''called for an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the companies increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">The typical worker Walmart receives 9.5 dollars an hour, but it does not match the height of expenditure, say staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, shows that, if Walmart will increase the average wage to $12 an hour, it will be a company of 3.2 billion dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's an average of 1.1% more than the company spent on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company Walmart moves wage increases fully on the shoulders of the consumer, each visit to the store only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as customers spend approximately 12, 39 dollars more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Walmart's defenders point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">`` Black Friday ''stores in the company from 8 o'clock on Thursday until the middle of the following day, and during this time the company Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, its cash carried out the `` Black Friday ''almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A representative of the company's Dan Fogelman said in an interview for the left-wing investor website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of `` less than five ''employees of Wal-Mart, and that the protest was all `` another media sensation '', organised by trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">`` Vacant Treasury! ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was malls Walmart (those in pokrokovém town are too popular, and therefore there are almost), but `` McDonald'and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says that sells billions of rations, and then you will not pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York, $7.25 an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">This Fastfoodové restaurant wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and the average receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well, I do not see how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">`` McDonald's employment u ''through nearly a quarter of american teenagers who work behind the counter after school on a part-time basis and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Currently, constantly meet in an interview with the staff of `` McDonald ', who complain that they must live on the money, and sometimes even to feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, a forum on the Wall Street Journal hanging comment, in which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protest, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at McDonald's, ''``the 40 th Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashiers and cooks in the fast-food started to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also, demanding that the fast food were based on the trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American laws prohibit the administration to prevent the creation of trade unions and punish activists, trade union movement harassment and redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="42">From the other side, they rarely facilitates the management of life.</seg>
<seg id="43">Introduced in the fast-food trade union, however, is difficult even for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Opposition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On this day, held noisy protests in a number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of that action was at noon at the gathering at the `` McDonald's ''near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said: `` McDonald,'' says that sells billions of rations, and then you will not pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work! ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were also support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that `` we must come together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity, he deserves every New Yorker! ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times, it was the largest events of its kind in the history of american sphere of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it took part in only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Whether this event happens to be the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">`` We have managed to deceive the brain, on average, ''</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Among fans of modern technology of virtual reality is trending topic augmented reality; recently, it means to perceive the world through the prism of the particular special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the start of the summer, at its annual conference showed Google working model of this news and in November, it was announced that the request for the patent also submitted by Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">From an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3 d technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that for scientists, this company are spectacles of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, the creation of a virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please tell us, in general, what your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time, we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes touching the screen with his finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate major changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors-this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility management using gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What is ahead of us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Despite the fact that the Kinect system also act on a physical level, very much interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3 D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The flow of information to improve the system (adopting more data), but the flow of output so far, not particularly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change it, we are actually three-dimensional imaging systems at the various technologies including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">It should allow the computer world into our physical world, making him reálnějším.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in much better shape.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place-to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think of the vocal control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It's a popular thing, but not exaggerate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Surely it can not be considered as a panacea-raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for control of the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about the gestures, but not on the vast, only such skoupých, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gestures while nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet, which followed the movements of bone and muscle.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it's big, but in theory it can reduce the size of the wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, that the future is the type of control, such as a gesture of + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How's that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- Ask me how, for example, to give you this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say it, and at the same time you show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">I usually just speak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So you want to get users to adapt to what the moment in the can or can not machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is not necessary, but it's mutual alignment.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that, in the near future, we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can accurately detect human reactions.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may, for example, be laser scanners, which provide a good in-depth distinction, that's very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements of the modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Today is not sufficient distinction, depth, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Basically, the current generation-that's what we are reflected in our work on the three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels speed of 1000 f / S.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not just the very megapixels, but as a matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">When you look at things are all current technologies are inadequate for us-it seems to be the work of the designers of the algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we have to remember not only the distinctions in axes X and Y, but also the Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movement is quite dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second, frankly, are a little bit, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did dotykový scanner with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the other value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how much it affects the human interaction with the machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, the work was very useful equivalent of such a device, but I do not need so many touches, but I need some images per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And increasing the number of cameras is necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In the Kinect system are now used three `` camera '', one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second-set of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the longer the camera-it's actually a common sensor visible zone.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">A larger number of cameras, it could potentially solve the problem …</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse, because it would have increased the necessary volume carried out the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras, and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">If I remember right, Microsoft (unlike Google) making public their glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You do not think that, in terms of the day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Of course, walk and constantly while holding smatphone in uplifted hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be `` portable ''form of the extension of the reality, which can be based on the platform at any time from the clouds to switch on his smartphone, design and on display around.</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses-it's a very personal device, it is their strength (private things you only see you), and at the same time the weakness of augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in `` Iron Man '', but also the ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem, which critics often point: there is no touching response!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands felt nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- Their lectures often say that augmented reality-it's the seventh after walking a breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the addition of the tactile well could become the eighth of a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">Yet used one of the interesting tricks-the use of second hand as a kind of background for display.</seg>
<seg id="66">An excellent way records depressing!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactility of these `` images in the air ''- for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beam in the defined point the finger, raises the touch-world feeling, but it's still very weak-as if he blew on his fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also the bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers-also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think that he can feel it, what seems to be the moment to feel when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- It's a good idea, we have not tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here comes another challenge, which will fight for a long time-as a man who is physically located in a very tight space, to believe that walks in an open, virtually infinite space-we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all like the clubs), moving platform and also big balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes the order, so is the work of many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers-many things is in full.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">- And when you understand that, you have to be an artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- On display in the house on něvském culture, where they were exposed to my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood what is my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then came a wave of old free unofficial artists and the new, free of the artists I could not understand.</seg>
<seg id="21">I was friends with artists, with a new wave of post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the `` puškinské 10 '', and further waves.</seg>
<seg id="22">That brings me to the theatre, dressing, the music of all genres, the addition of the word.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- And it's all merged in your art at the clinic-for me it was important to find himself in the centre of the culture of St Petersburg, where they should collect all the best powers of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I took place at puškinské 10, and there still existed before the reconstruction of the hudebně - art club, the bohemian club, the home of the petěrburkské bohemia.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is that much: NOM Tequila, jazz, do not forget, as Šnura brought the project `` ear Van Gogh ''.</seg>
<seg id="26">Šnur and his friends sang under the plywood light song, they dressed in full-length leotards, midway between the dowager's composer Igor, who is now in vogue.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the band began to play live, became `` Leningradem ''.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg led many programmes that-galivských times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtěnberga, began his great career, basic education and training from us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Gallery `` D '', `` Griboedov 137 club-that's the aftermath of Art Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">This way they left our workers and patrons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000, the survey was held in the press, the special price was `` people in our city. ''</seg>
<seg id="34">The nomination of `` Artist of the year ''was appointed, I ended my peak.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the new times under the old rules is the work of an uncomfortable, I am a man of truth, integrity, and the culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In recent years, it's easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you can be popular, but not too much.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works are characterised by an identifiable way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - That many of my paintings are hits, in which is vividly captured timeliness and pervasiveness.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have the program, the exhibition `` russian museum in the clowns you are a ''.</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are nadčasovou category.</seg>
<seg id="41">Before, I used to be a social, and today it's painful and horrible.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clowns you are a everything blurs, scanning the tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the slapstick, get the grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, to save the world through the totalitarian disguise in nařizovacím Procedure.</seg>
<seg id="45">Today people face under clothing, through the external drive, not the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or maybe he can not shake his hand and spit in his face.</seg>
<seg id="47">And the trick will be removed to change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- We have recently seen you in the role of the town's organ-grinder. - cultural town should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">And who would it be if I did not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- And it may be commercial art fair?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Today should be commercial, utility art in-depth, gentle, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">The disintegration of cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Before the people assembled in clumps, La Boheme loved one, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Today everything broke on mikrospolečnosti today, it's very hard to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not 100 bill to like it all.</seg>
<seg id="56">Today is to think about whom he likes.</seg>
<seg id="57">Today everyone has a cultural hero of their 100 fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- And the Stasu Michajlova comes several thousand spectators!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- The fans come, there are sexually involved the social sphere.</seg>
<seg id="60">And the cultural ground comes 300 people and 10 thousand of them coming, and the result is less management, money, everything away.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have the fans, the main point is that no one was fooled and violates what is established.</seg>
<seg id="62">When I was young, I painted such images in one collector, hanging on the wall with Falkem and Larionovem.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the images, which most people end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, people often confuse the terms.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say: the culture minister, consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture of the consumer, it's ok.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture on the previous day, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money for drawing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">And I am for a culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Cyril, what is the lack of St Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- Good experts on culture.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such a concept: official over culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">Not all of them, but they can deal with the culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Full tsars it was in all the czars, perhaps too did not understand the culture, but understood the need to support the real experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow today are good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">In St Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are zastrčení somewhere in a corner, because they are great need experts, who correctly valued these experts and bring them on the right path.</seg>
<seg id="76">Today prospers vkusovština.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but that, frankly, they say, not all modern art, we accept there are artists who should look for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What's your Petěrburk?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - It's not Petěrburk Capital of Culture in Moscow culture is much more, there's the right soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our úhoru art is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural land, but in today's writers more than readers, that's wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are a great many people who are curious, who like to exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">For us it is just such a layer of weak.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need to art has become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is being implemented for the funds of the grant of St Petersburg St.</seg>

<seg id="11">Addressing the issues of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already half a century ago were conducted experiments on the plants.</seg>

<seg id="14">It was then carried out rendered insects in orbit-very little fruit fly Drosophila.</seg>

<seg id="17">But then the problems begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">`` The problem is that this bird must find support to stand on its own feet and start to move, ''says the lab director of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) Ran Vladimir Syčev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If they can not find support, the birds chaotically fall and somersault.</seg>
<seg id="20">After 10 hours in a freshly vylíhnutých birds to total extinction instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The birds did not respond to light or noise.</seg>

<seg id="30">After landing on Earth Space rats born offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">Approach to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, however, has so far failed.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's a difficult task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The animals at the loss of a normal environment simply can not realise their sexual instincts.</seg>
<seg id="34">The man, unlike the animals, in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create the appropriate emotional background.</seg>

<seg id="41">Whether he can deliver a baby after a flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">`` This question still unanswered, ''says veteran-raketově space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The child's father was also a spaceman Andriyan Nikolayev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the son of second-born wife Svetlana kosmonautce Savické, which visited orbit twice and also worked in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="46">The risk, however, remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only a few cosmonauts, after years of born and grow healthy offspring.</seg>
<seg id="48">`` Moreover, it can be dangerous in the orbital years, ''states the spaceman-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia's Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Humanity still must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">CPK Hydrolaboratoř stage is a mandatory training to fly.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in the conditions with zero gravity astronauts to acquire habits needed to work in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water mimics the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Though for adults is the water even comfortable, but in its own way, a strange environment for young children is a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Short ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between that child is located in an average of 9 months in her mother's place-its and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, it's logical, because from the moment of birth, since that first a bath, expire only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">`` It's very little for the child to something forgotten, ''says instructor swimming newborns Aksenovová Marina.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if it is for the new-born baby weightlessness natural state, then, for the women's natural inevitable gravity, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the weightlessness occurs very quickly to chřadnutí abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, dropping the body's ability to drive the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">It can leave aside, if they will work stimulators muscle activity in childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the body's mother, forcing the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="62">`` What next? ''asks Valeri Polyakov complex issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the baby also needs the artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If not for the organism gravity, not form a skeleton or set of muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">Born in orbit, it is not possible to dress like an adult into a special suit with the coach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Just be deprived of what it needs to develop unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="67">`` If you go into the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a strange environment, we will bring the country to a disabled person, that would be totally nepřizpůsobená this environment, ''predicts the head of the Commission for Bioethics IBMP Ran Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So the babies in the universe today is just a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">But when the time came to become a reality, and when the earth issue in their ships on a distant planet, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The chief OWL švarcsystému failed because politicians control:</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has in connection with the public good-and high quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview for Hejl says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">`` The law will never be perfect, but must be correct in his application-that's what we are missing in my opinion, ''says the current situation of Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar findings also suggest the joint control of the czech and german inspectors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the improper practice provides access to the so-called `` Petr Nečas švarcsystému ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the app entrepreneur will not bother his checks-is therefore illegal or legal?</seg>
<seg id="8">`` The law must not be somehow set, and if anything, so you do not, the Prime Minister can not prevent in the work of the Office, which has a duty to walk, monitor and enforce the obligations, ''says Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the House of Commons, you are talking about a joint project between the czech and german party, which was compared to the legislation on public contracts in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was specifically?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The parallel control that we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply, it means that a european legislation regulates how the public address, followed by is the individual national legislation and then also the very practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We are all in this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, showed us a very interesting differences-generally speaking, the legislation is with us, maybe even `` more and more sophisticated '', however, the practice is in some parameters better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create in the more precise rules, but there is a need to engage in the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Do you actually this project can help him for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such a joint control could contribute to stop efforts to precise laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, if it did not have a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (which does not always the lowest price), to avoid the enrichment and, where appropriate, for criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by reducing the limit, it does not need to be achieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maybe it was a system with a `` paper '', that those who want to look for holes in the system, so they will draw a much easier than if the limit remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You are talking about domestic problems with the transfer of the legislation on public procurement into practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How the system works in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar to our office OWL, or it's otherwise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The authorities, as the OWL Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized as we also has a college, only makes a slightly different way, but in principle, both authorities doing likewise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also, the powers are to some extent similar, however, that Germany has the Federal arrangements, so has the auditors, even at the level of the Länder-in that system is a bit different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can only control the federal money, represented by the state resources.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities, control the level of federal auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What's the legislation, so it's easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, without specific data like comparing, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but I can not say that everything is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is therefore also have better supervisors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But I must say that both countries as a model, faced with a wide range of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they could not be any value in cooperation with our office, no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In terms of domestic legislation, for your office meant the amendments to the law on public procurement, and there are already some of its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Whereas the validity of this novel is relatively short, so we have not yet in control events.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we are doing checks, needs to be reckoned with some delays.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Seeing it only in the process of preparing future checks-we started our new instrument `` detection of risk '', through which we inefficiencies through almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analyzed them-there are those changes, of course, will show, because they change the limits, the conditions of some types of competition will be adjusted and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The approval of this law, then consider the more valuable, or further burden on red tape?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem, which may arise that those rules `` tighten ''and will not be able to follow them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now for the operation of the previous rules are controlled by people committed to the provider (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes Regional Council) to every non-compliance with the law on public procurement means of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">So has the price of the law in this way made?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think that in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit the formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">How so?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's show the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the app entrepreneur will not bother checks that the so-called `` švarcsystému ''- and what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is illegal or legal?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must not be somehow set, and if anything, so you do not, the Prime Minister can not prevent in the work of the Office, which has a duty to walk, monitor and enforce the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You could say: `` change the law and allow it '', but it can not say that we do, nothing like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public contracts are fairly strict rules, as what is to be formally made-which is right to protect the competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand it is tragic, as the candidate with the best offer is excluded for formal shortcomings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but must be correct in his application-that's what we are missing in my opinion.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about that, in less than a month to come to an end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It's just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with the band the Tap Tap from doing rather fun, and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent him from the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December, moreover, will hold a totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can imagine him closer to readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The national fund-raiser, which we plan for the past two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar declared on December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally it was about my idea, then we are all out with our art director John Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want together with the public to think about the condition of the once this world to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose purchase at www. e-tap. com people can also support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A group of the Tap Tap, together with other interprety also sang the anthem of the so-called against the end of the world, which is called `` the end of the world canceled ''.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today is very popular on YouTube, also on these benefičních concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, in the very end, if we do everything and the end of the world is …</seg>
<seg id="18">Sing it all artists on all three concerts in parallel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anthems suddenly link also in a unique live coverage on tv.</seg>

<seg id="20">The words to the song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the video plays Thomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl X …</seg>
<seg id="21">How do you get them to cooperate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are also working with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, whereas we are having a lot of benefičních events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying to be heavily involved in such projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that the majority of cooperation with us interests and enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The equipment accessible training centre, which had Studeo sixth year implement with civic associations, TAP in Jedlička's Institute for the Handicapped.</seg>
<seg id="27">The schools regularly Jedličkova Institute instructors and engaged in activities that they enjoy and interests.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the funds to the lecturers set ourselves, we try to allow it in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there is a separate building, with this move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Each concert out several bands and artists.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what you have picked them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to build a program that appeals to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague gets Chinaski, Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere, Dan Bárta, the Tap Tap, Blitz Banga and Jiří dry.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details may be found at www. cz. kpks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Planning any similar `` bombastické actions ''in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, for the first time, we will act on the Prague Spring, so here we have an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year, we would also like to play in the czech national house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I'd like to link with the speech in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are minimalistické, still have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London, or in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap, however, is a group of disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">How these journeys manage logistically and organisationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as bad as it seems.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members of the electric cart, her wheelchair must travel in the luggage compartment, with, of course, carrying a large amount of cargo and boxes with instruments …</seg>
<seg id="43">However, it is not yet always coped without problems, CSA and British Airways, to us they were well prepared, I often wonder.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the výjezdům abroad can compare, differ in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have not yet met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we are just in Russia, we saw that in the East are all still in their infancy.</seg>
<seg id="48">MOSCOW-Prague is very barrier, there's still, unusual for a man on the electric cart by itself in the centre of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are no such obvious as a wheelchair users prefer in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately there arise civic associations, which try to problems for people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in contrast, we still need to catch up with more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There's a lot of things in which we are still behind …</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on to the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is quite common, that even people with severe hendikepem separately on the public can go to the bathroom, the museum anywhere …</seg>
<seg id="55">But it's not very common, that there are a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, are in contrast with the Tap Tap slightly ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things are going to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The band the Tap Tap is currently very popular, but a few years back what you in 1998 made it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I had a lot of young people who were interested in something to do.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am a musician, playing the saxophone, inter alia, so I along with my colleague founded zájmový musical ring.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and over time it, as our host Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But the popularity came up in recent years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us when we started to link with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">We figured we work that can not be seen, in fact, as there would be no.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, they can afford good teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was your aim to go with the Tap Tap so high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="68">It's crowded Showbusiness things, where one of the other models.</seg>
<seg id="69">In a way, it's logical, all new is accepted, and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">The things that are unique, it's very little, but I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression for a man who sees us for the first time is, of course, a pity, it's only natural …</seg>
<seg id="72">But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with no hendikepem suffering from all the orphaned creatures, which we have to regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are the people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary funds.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if something to people with hendikepem, so it's not a shift for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">This success has helped, too, that it was a hard taskmaster, how many people you call?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you want to do a good job, we must be in many cases, uncompromising and require a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it's perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when they find out twice a week must go to the test on a product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, so is the enthusiasm quickly leaves.</seg>
<seg id="79">But that's not the way it works everywhere, in every group, who wants to work and who wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently the band the Tap Tap 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them had its beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are open to a group of people, and they can not be helped.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and desire, has opened the door for us always</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week at a meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, adopted in Poland for the 20 th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full-fledged member of the ESA, 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched its close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the next years participated on a number of projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the path of Poland into space began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Flights into space is devoted to the polish fans before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, remind lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, December 6, 1933, represented the thoughts of his pioneering work into space.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of the young engineer (b. 1905), leaving the audience cold and after years of Šternfeld remembered that, Dr. Jan Gadomski interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld in 1934, gained entry into the space in France, the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan vzpomenutý Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a big Astronomy and Space.</seg>
<seg id="10">In polish journals published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski became the world's known promoter of aerospace and his contribution was valued, and that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 1925, was built in Poland, the rail car, which should be equipped with rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and unknown or the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear whether the rocket should be used for the start-up of the mantrip or its brakes.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information about this handcar are known only from the period of the press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From 1933 with the rocket shells began with the polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of the surviving materials, it is clear that the research concluded the prakzických stage tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of german troops research was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, the specialist press discovered a photovoltaic Fighter rocket, designed by Rohoziński engineer and the following year out Rakieta work-torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author-Leliwy Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war was all projects the military use of missile technology gave temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all works coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after a two-year work of his activities, ended the opening of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further work dedicated kosmonautice after the war in the polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">The first is the mention of society in the November edition of the class of 1954 Problemy magazine, in which there are four obsáhlejší articles devoted astronautice.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, a company that will address space.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, it was already running projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space industry's perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the year 1956 polish Astronautics company (PTA) snažia entry into an international astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">This function held until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket (RM Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish missile, which conducted the research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of vc-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket to 1,800 feet long, about 80 cm and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, it was built an improved version of the vc-1 A, and in the summer of 1959, were launched in the desert flight test of the two-stage rocket, Bledovské vc-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 metres long, and her weight was about 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another development type I should be able to genuine scientific work-rocket vc-34 should have dostup up 14.5 km and its task of monitoring the height of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962, was the further development of the suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor to the first rocket type RM became Meteor missile-1 in 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was designed as a two tier, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Developed three types (marked Meteor-1 A-1 b and c-1), which varied in size space for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">In a rocket-Meteor 1 A was available space on the volume of 0.4 per litre, Meteor-1 B on the volume of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1 C on the volume of 0.62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum ceiling for all three types of 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 in Aviation Institute Meteor missile development-2, whose first flight testing began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket-Meteor 2 should lift-off weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Subsequently, were built versions of the Meteor-2 H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Still, it is worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in the 1960 s and the creation of the National Committee of the COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also in the programme Intercosmos involved in research into space on a soviet artificial satellites and in 1978, the polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became Vladimir Remkovi other interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution made public on a lively discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal export-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems, standing in a permanent conflict between them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cause is the principle of free trade and free movement of unrestrained private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The influence of the significant differences between the price of labour (wages) to the price of strain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this term is to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in that `` sweeps ''price competitor with a view to tear down the larger market share and increase their profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or to buy cheap, or terminated. the result is high unemployment in the countries where prices are work compared with other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the private capital has no social responsibility and accountability for it to be produced, rising unemployment, not necessarily social spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">The whole situation magnifies the absolute unwillingness of Lords entrepreneurs to pay taxes and replace the economic and social celospolečenské losses in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to set specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies create a situation in which the governments of countries are forced to enter into a mutual competition with the aim of artificially lower social level population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments give private capital to its own people, regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is mainly reflected in changes in applicable laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to force his own population adopted by the price of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's what's happening on the set of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, limiting the rights of employees in the area of employment law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are already a number of years of public shed food for the poor, who can not feed your own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of such people are already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In improving the competitiveness of the german economy is routinely to cases that properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay the breadline.</seg>
<seg id="23">This scandal was published, even in the case of auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures of virtually all of the southern states of the EU inevitably leads to the same situation, where people are under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the social level either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19 th century, or scrape for starvation wages on the edge of society in the hope that the country might lose one private equity capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">There must be but ask where but lose?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it's from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or will not, because the chinese, indian, brazilian, or the Turk, Marokánec, or egyptian, or african still work for a fraction of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="27">It applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and media ad nauseam, argues that the state can not participate in the capital on their own holding that managed the economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private equity, he insists, was of the opinion that the State can not control interventions to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">We need to ask whether the private capital, now governed by the policy and the entire state in their own egoistickém meaning.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is a clear answer yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of virtually omnipresent in all states of the ubiquitous lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation which appears in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefit, the legislation is virtually all reprehensible, but nothing criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the ministries for lack of funds awarded the drafting of the Laws of private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power as coming from people as they proclaim the Constitution of the western type, but from the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear that the consumer-oriented liberal democracy is now rapidly into the situation, as her Appiános describes in his book the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeia: ''the state had long been in complete disarray, and a man of violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">For bribes, illegal acquisition and the stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Podplácení and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people went to the polls in advance of the sale, with the voice of the `` noble ''… people do not apply for the office, so once was as a result of this breakdown was eight months without consuls. `` …'' began to really talk about it, that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda and that there is a need to choose a vigorous man.. ''he thought Appiános Pompey, but become Caesar, which changed the democracy took the self-rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The conclusion as in antiquity is the current company based on the reckless preference own benefit regardless of society-wide interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private equity is not inherently unable to understand and apply for the benefit of society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now, as then, the unparalleled decadence elites without any attempt to reform profound.</seg>
<seg id="43">The advent of fašistických causality and communist regimes so we have to look in the liberalisation of reckless economic systems in the 19 th and 20 th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">The current state of the extinction of these systems can be in favour of a liberal democracy, considered a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignored in the future possible offences of casualties, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already seen together with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanent.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition at both international and european level Interior will the government of the Czech Republic to continue the search for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore the system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted politicko-social reforms that will strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens to the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the state.</seg>

<seg id="5">The released hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, has not been able to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later compounded the fiasco of an attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Arrest diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations brokered by the Algerian Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their ordeal at home even protiíránského Solidarity sparked a wave of sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.</seg>

<seg id="13">The CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities had managed to get them from Iran, helped his extravagant cover story-went to the canadian passports as members of the film crew, who was in the country at the location for filming of science fiction epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert on `` exfiltraci ''Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">So the legend was credible, the film project in the specialist magazine, held press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">Details of the operation were long classified, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck film is a particular combination of more genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the realism of the political thriller, at the same time, the so-called `` Caper movie '', the story of vydařeného piece-podrazu example may be a series of Danny's teammates.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, so changing moods-on the one hand, the pojaté sequences from Tehran in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické period photographs of events and the manner in which they were the same situations presented in the film-the large differences in it).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the light passages from Hollywood pojednané with irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions-the men in suits to analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the phone …</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleckovi is remarkably managed to restart his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vysmívaného actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of cynical comment.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, after dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller of the city (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it's the first Affleck slide, which take place in režisérově Boston home.</seg>
<seg id="27">Feeling for the atmosphere of the place he was among the characteristics of the režisérovy older films povyšovaly over Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck and it also reflected in Argu, where Tehran `` plays Canada. ''</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování real events-the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its přehlednosti, who also conveys emotion and confusion, the nepřevídatelnosti arise when a sudden move history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes fictitious (false staff on the Tehran Bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many events in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with that story told by the offer much in the film the meaning of sensational scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully with the little works, sometimes to reality-přimyslí something there so elegantly (based on the scene, in which an imminent crisis at the Tehran airport averts call in America and chase down the runway is a pretty).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of the Argo's ramblings resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are roles in Hollywood collaborators very šaramantní, their figures would he deserved more space and are not in this movie is far from the only ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleck film loses a bit of a dramatic move, it's a snapshot, which can be monitored with mild interest, to appreciate the implementation and retro style thrillers evokující 70 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="37">But pulling hard.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of one still in some way living history and how they are exaggerated notions of allpowerful and all-knowing secret services, but will suffice.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The site www.. com, which annually bankovnipoplatky issues poll of nejabsurdnější bank charges, has now decided to contest the `` the most absurd regulation or ideas from the workshop of the EU ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">`` Led us to this last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in management of large european companies, ''said the organizer of the survey, Patrick Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominated by the absurd is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of the unification of the premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet while the women were in the prices of the life insurance beneficiary, because they are for insurance objectively less risky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">`` The other incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU may nominate people by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place until the end of February 2013, ''he informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial EU regulations include even mandatory blending biofuels into fuel, which, as a result of damage to nature, the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the size of the slepičích cages, which this year, significantly expensive eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The criticism previously faced the prohibition on the use of the term butter or pomazánkové decommissioning light bulbs from the sale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Quality bananas have 14 inches</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The EU apparatus often decided under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobbies, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (as the Czech Republic now and the threat of a veto promotes the requirements of its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby stood behind it, for example, that the bananas of the highest quality in the Union to achieve at least 14 cm in length and not show `` anomální curvature. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission meanwhile said that only harmonises past nejednotné national standards, which complicated trading.</seg>
<seg id="14">Standards of fruit and vegetables, the EU over the opposition of some states softened, pointing out that the existing directives to food waste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in the poll may also be the last EU regulation, which must be sold by balloons mandatory warnings that children younger than 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU's appeal to the american research, in which the balloons are among the leading cause of death in children's toys to asphyxiation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similar restrictions now pay for children up to 14 years in blowing into pouťových frkaček.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Quaint ideas are born at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Rather it is absurd and then rule on themselves by european officials-anyone who has a formal role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece to use the name of Macedonia and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Server. Com Bankovnípoplatky in cooperation with the association of laissez-faire nominating liberal economists in the survey, except in certain of the above absurd even Union regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set a maximum volume of food stocks, which could be located within the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic then crossed the example set by the volumes for canned mushrooms, for which he threatened a large fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organisers of the survey also took the idea to pay some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies for the subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas, however, emerged in Brussels, but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">`` We are handicapováni that we have got the sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ask the European Union for reimbursement, ''he said in the fall of 2004, the minister of agriculture Jaroslav PALAS (PM).</seg>
<seg id="27">As the argument that for us to breed a lot of grain and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should become full of warehouses, which had to be exported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The Czech Republic has continued to ports, we should the EU under Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The European Commission finally came out to meet the Czech Republic, organised a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Grant to obtain the subsidy offered municipalities of the Regional Development Ministry managed by the German Minister Paul (US-DEU), in particular, should go to the application of subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU's bizarre regulations are the exception:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of EU regulation and, at the same time, more efficient operation and development of the entire Union under a number of experts deserve recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Problem is, according to experts such as spending of EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of the european integration, but that in the budget negotiations until the Member States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The emotion between the Czechs raises even that, as well as other countries of the Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to a specific indication of their traditional products, and not always in this struggle will succeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czechs, although after a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians our marking Olomouc curd, but domestic rum, whose tradition for us dates back to the 19 th century, we had our producers to rename tuzemák.</seg>
<seg id="36">Naming rum can carry only products from the cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The official list of authorised products in the EU, in the company of the world-famous feta cheese and Gorgonzola, from the German Lübeck marzipan or parmské hams had ended, for example, the Karlovy Vary Pohořelický Třeboňský kapr biscuits, and even the outer package.</seg>
<seg id="38">The mark of the EU can also boast Pardubický gingerbread and wafers.</seg>

<seg id="13">My aim is not function, the function of the instrument is, how can I make their visions.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's why I need to maximise the impact and the strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not just that, as a nation at the pub and on television, but that the trampling everyone who wants to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To add the media dehonestují man and that mistake the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">I might not be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an advisor to George Paroubek.</seg>

<seg id="21">As president, but you do not have that power, and the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you solve?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I was a citizen to lobby for it to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politics-when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, on purpose is rejected, and the citizens of the residence.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nestraník have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My preference is that, without the partisan compartmentalisation dogmas and I can take what is best for our country, from each party and apply it.</seg>

<seg id="68">By the way, I have Aston Martin, because that was my kid's dream-I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was a gallant women and also fought against the wickedness and abuses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive Aston Martin, you have the property for 60 million, and you do not have the money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money into it too much to give you.</seg>
<seg id="71">It's not very convincing.</seg>

<seg id="74">The campaign was already 2.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">The architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures to occur only in his head-Spijkenisse, for example, and recently built a mountain of books-2 pictures</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">`` This building seems cheerful, looks futuristic. finally is once again to see something interesting, ''says Lisette Verhaig that goes around the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, it technician in a large firm, says: `` of course, the house is nice. ''</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder what today we need a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are all Internet iPady and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily nobody, or so?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, in close proximity to the Rotterdam without their own jobs, which is not worth a visit, holding a special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To this silly situation resolved, made a few years ago, the decision to contribute to a general education and build seven nice gaudy reinforced concrete thumbnails of fictional bridges, which are the shown on euros.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive but he was not dizzy.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we have to have a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural insanely courageous MVRDV, Master sloupcových graphs and vtipných issuer, often even cynical buildings, adopted the thing with the usual calm and the competitive meeting in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the Commission is still stunned, looking around and shrugs, piling cheeky Maas their gifts to the size and his aktivisticky reasoned speech ended the words `` nice urban community! ''</seg>
<seg id="14">So this is my proposal to the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain was for 30 million against.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalizačního project, which includes also underground parking, supermarket, mail and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 flats.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November was a mountain of books honoured with the second place `` BEST Library of NL 2012 ''.</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Small-town gray, which still could offer more than postmoderní pedestrian zone and extremely ugly City Hall, whose white facade would rather expected dairy, is due to richer by some contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">In particular, but now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: čtenářské El Dorado under the hatch to cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although the elevator ride means massif mountains, but the actual space and reading passion turn up at pěším control topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">All sides of the glass-walled interior is bright and clear, the floor of the páleného kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly reflect the atmosphere of the public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You see parkové benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">`` Normally costs shelves of books along the facade and is in the middle of a dark space, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal, ''says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We are the classic spatial configuration built upside down and the space for the reader we sprouted from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly used: Wednesday offices are situated, internet library, the chess club, the Organic Center and operator of the house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A special pleasure are black shelves of books, which are one lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The appearance of the structure, and the smell of an alien nature.</seg>
<seg id="33">The unknown building material shaking their heads and even avowed architects and engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">`` We wanted to work with recycled materials, ''says Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the municipality of Spijkenisse, the magazine's standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in one fríském holding one day they encountered a waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years in the greenhouses and on the fields in the Netherlands is used as the basis for roots milimetrové webs of synthetic material.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's cheap and effective.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thin linen, one of the last two seasons, and he's ready to blow up into the huge waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">The library was fleece-for the first time in such quantities-pressed down on the thickness of the four inches.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Human) where the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that smells like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps to get to the top.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journey will be in literary cafe rewarded not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly on the right the moisture in the air in the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Gifts for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">`` I did not believe it, but this house is despite many glass surfaces drill project in terms of ecology, ''says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heating and cooling the warmth of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun is shining in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">The wide wooden vazníky glued, perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as zastínění and pick up a large part of the solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest will fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, initial skeptic of the it industry, already a new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Both Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also the traditional chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even as the `` long awaited Spijkenisse soul ''.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: each of the people of the city was a few weeks ago invited to open in order to devote a book of his personal fund.</seg>
<seg id="55">So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully fitted with the library, which currently comprises 70 000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has been proven.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are completely full.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">`` There is nothing worse than a half-empty library, ''says Winy Maas architect.</seg>
<seg id="59">`` I think that, thanks to our house now has a new home every inhabitant of a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it was just for show.</seg>
<seg id="62">That MVRDV succes in Royal discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse decided the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">No matter how young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It's finally starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: `` the Germans must play a greater role, ''</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in deciding on the acceptance of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szaboa that Berlin teetering on the edge of a narrow diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: Germany earlier this week, the first signal that voted against the proposal for the Palestinians observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel prudent.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think I will not support the american position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence-without, however, would be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also delayed the vote, when it came to the establishment of a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">We ultimately put NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany, for serious international issues a clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that, just as his foreign policy, from the direction of the policy, which was so controlled by the US, in the direction of the german foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is all the more difficult, that the Europeans have a coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are between two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="18">They are expected to play the independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think, in his role as only stay, but they are on their way to the `` normálnější ''foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">In foreign policy, in France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly does the `` normal ''foreign policy from a german point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Shows preparedness to take in the event of national interests and positions, which are independent of the attitudes of the US or european partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that the german foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, the Export and his relationships with certain regions, like Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of the other major powers, and therefore, Germany has to protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Should the economic interests of the impact on the attitude of the Middle East conflict and vote in the United Nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, especially in states around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">It must, therefore, be careful to discourage the public, but even the elite in arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I would not want it but not ascribe too much of it, it's not entirely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">In any case, that plays an important role in the german considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Damage relations with Germany, the US, Germany, in the case of two important decision delayed the vote, for example, in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think that, in Europe and even the US rules the great sympathy for the german position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not think that it was so dramatic breakthrough as the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps from Germany even harvests some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It signals that must be considered as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different views on the palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, by contrast, clearly expressed for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are between the US and many european nations differences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These disparities exist in America's internal policies.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the european position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But as a result of the political situation in this position, of course, serve the public.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that the differences in opinions really are not so large, as they always do.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too thrilled Netanjahuovou policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is not for Germany to align their close relations with Israel and the US on one side and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that this is exactly what the Germans difficult.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans would, of course, was a little easier, if there was a coherent and united european policy, which is currently not.</seg>
<seg id="47">They can not, therefore, be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is just what they do with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the european position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It's not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It has always been a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as a major international player wants to take a major role at all??</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is the lead role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany it is still used, it's still uncomfortable, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, when we look at the european crisis, as always, when Germany take a greater role, incurred protiněmecké moods.</seg>
<seg id="57">It's easy for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a more vulnerable position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable for a variety of neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">US influence in european politics now constantly falling, but the EU this vacuum currently blank. who's otherwise left?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans would just have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they do not like it, they feel uncomfortable and make them that much neoblíbenějšími-c'est la vie.</seg>

<seg id="1">`` The protection of the brands in China: when are the Puma and Armani suddenly chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world mark, Polo Ralph Lauren.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">There is the designation, which is completely officially registered in China, but with the original company has nothing.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, for the protection of the public, so long as the indictment by the real owners of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then, it is not clear whether domohou rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">`` It is still difficult for foreigners in China to protect its brand, ''says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of the Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of the rights of the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week will land on my desk in the new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Counterfeiters have just a few letters in addition to register their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Gucci brand, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada instead will register Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, they are legally copied and german companies, like sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens the folder with records známkového office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14 September 2010 he left one chinese company to protect the brand Puma Zegna DF. made a name which, even at the fashion house of parazituje Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and violations of intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="15">In major cities are několikapatrové malls, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="16">But other cases are Pattlochovy. the authority of their principals goes against chinese firms have received from známkového all officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it `` Bang Mingpai '', the onset of the tag.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word focuses on `` Bang Dakuan ''.</seg>
<seg id="19">This meant women who hunt rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">`` It damages the trade, we have to fight, ''calls on Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">`` The mark is diluted, the monopoly disappears, the damage to the image is great. ''</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and court costs of affected industries are in the millions, mainly for the precious sample products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company's data for market research is the CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing fast.</seg>
<seg id="25">The deletion of dubious records in the record labels can be difficult to achieve, however, and it's worth something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The procedure can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected the claims, because vytýkaný name became, after a long period of `` market reality. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff has the misfortune to plagiátorovi still pay because damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Known cases involving the graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, the Daimler lost the legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery, Sany undertaking, who recently took over the german manufacturer pumps on the cement mixture of Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese may therefore still use the emblem, which resembles the star of the Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company, which bought Volvo, originally used the blue-white logo, which resembled a BMW. dispute was settled, the Geely logo had to change.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had known the crocodile turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">Office známkový CTMO recognizes that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of too much of a small number of staff and premises.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year, said `` the work of the emergency situation back to normal. ''</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of raw proceedings on objections fell by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">These cases were closed, 57,000, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still waiting on the office still 81 500 complaints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To do something about it's expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As in China, they are often impressive number.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year was CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the brand, which is almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's a record, and it means that China for the tenth time behind a list of new applications throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is also true for the number of all applicable safeguard brands-is a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">It simply means that every login at an average cost of 1280 renminbi, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Start against the dispute is několikanásobek, as shown in the case of the german family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">This group has more than seven years of fighting against the chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans had achieved that was cancelled his illegal imitovaných production of car parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the forger making chinese rights to the brand continues to Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">Alone we have failed, as in Germany can not be protected by the surname, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management of the company, Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">Office známkový CTMO then also object to the Munich company rejected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In two other instances of the Freudenberg got right, but the defendant in the dispute fights on this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It should be just as careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has confidence that the case could lead to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: `` the procedure is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money, and the nerves. ''</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs can not be quantified in the archives of the company had to even see a hundred years old, to produce the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg opposing vainly offered a `` high six-figure sum in euro ''for the purpose of the settlement of the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">`` So you see, what it means to us, ''says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Risk that the danger from the Far East hits, and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">And that, in the case of his imitators to ensure the unprotected brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">One chinese producer, for example, wanted to log in Germany marking Freudenberg for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of the business, the group had given up, he could turn the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">`` It should be just as careful, ''says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He also advises the german firms Pattloch lawyer to trade with China is very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">Not enough to rely on international známková rights. foreigners would rather have `` everything in any way for protection, known in China, ''says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the Freudenberg in the last act of his drama with the brand, then I will have to be the party to pay royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or will we be in a contested segment pushed out of the market.</seg>

<seg id="38">Crabs and scabies belongs to parazitárním sleep.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to the group most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea can be found mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five of all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between the men.</seg>
<seg id="42">For straight adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often chlamydiové, infections trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is between heterosexuálními adults in our extended relatively little, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV for this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Between the juveniles are chlamydiové infections occur significantly more often than other groups of the population.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the survey, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, between the juveniles often human papillomaviruses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How developed the number of infections?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all of the sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of infected syfilidou according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 was approximately 700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">That's roughly one tenth of less than a year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms of attention of venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and pustules or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, cause no pain or other symptoms, and will remain so nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">The risk of the disease may reduce the condoms, however, offer 100 percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases may be partially to the infection of impurities and narrow physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend, in particular, in the case of the frequent rotation of sexual partners, routine examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure the most sleep and prevent future consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="66">Some of them have even 14 orphans, giving them a roof over your head, and they are concerned about the children to attend every day in time in uniform to school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Children who already have one, go to a shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman paid by society as well as two cooks, daily cooking for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">`` Voices for Africa '', founded the school sewing, two henhouses and together with the American Health Organization dogs arranged that many people in the village had to do the test for HIV.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is commonplace. even if it is the disease throughout the country so obvious, all of it is silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">`` AIDS is absolutely taboo, ''says Annette Lennartz, `` because it has something to do with sexuality.''</seg>
<seg id="72">In fact, some odd in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last black Africa an absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for its nemírným lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">The state approved by way of life by, among other things, that the blame for the HIV virus in recent decades so quickly spread.</seg>
<seg id="76">But many migrant workers, who have the virus spread the word around the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that condoms are not on every corner, `` but no one uses them.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different-unprotected intercourse. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To support at least a little bit of cultural exchange, travels Imbongi choir once for two, three years together after South Africa and singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and the confidence of blacks, many in the southern tip of the dark continent known in the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus was full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks-so not only brings the mood and joy, but also elicit tears at many of the wild frontier soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children, which have a sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although this village could hardly find maps in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than familiar.</seg>
<seg id="83">`` Go to Esitjeni, there is light, ''says the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when you return to Heidelberg, which is miles away as the crow flies 8733, the dupajícím singers in rehearsal on Bergheimer Straße, you see that light shines here.</seg>

<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes grew-and look to broker, are still deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what does `` principles ''?</seg>
<seg id="17">It was and is a matter of interpretation and may be worried that islamists this vague wording and their associated legal free space used for stricter interpretation of Sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least it illuminates the newly added section: in all matters relating to the Sharia should deal with the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important islamic institution in the country with a big influence on the whole Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">Not necessarily, but this may mean that the clerisy will exercise oversight of the legislation, which would bring to justice the de facto withdrawal -.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The problem is also that continue to be maintained in the civil jurisdiction of military courts.</seg>
<seg id="22">These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictatorship in military custody until 11 000 civilians.</seg>
<seg id="24">Standing in the proposal, the State should also protect `` the true nature of the egyptian family and support her morals and values. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is legally worded so inaccurately, that means this section of the institutions of the state could even control the content of the film and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">In plain language, it is nothing more than censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">After all, no section in writing the explicit equality of men and women.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In this case, the caricature of a president or a joke at the expense of experts, right?</seg>

<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: the most foul-smelling fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">It might be the secret of success of the country associated with the local voracious appetite for an extremely smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a few overripe cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put it down in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So can smell the paralysis of the smell of rakfisku, one of the largest norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There's the snow, a beautiful view-and the ubiquitous smell in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Salted trout Rakfisk is fermented in the water for up to a year-it depends on how much you want to fish smell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As dusk and begins to be cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet the festival devoted to this, as you say, the best nejpodmanivějšímu food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">`` You eat it raw and then zapijete aquavitu drink, ''says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called `` Rakfisk general '', which is responsible for the course of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us, people eat small cubes and fish and with them a large quantity of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">`` Some people are better than rakfisk aquavit, ''says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The drink may trump the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few bits and pieces I will try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad-it's like a piece of sushi, who was on a long journey by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different time in Norway, poverty, and yet because there was no refrigerator, fish in the fall, soaking into airtight barrels of water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermenting, dragged and eating-senses are undoubtedly blunt alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation ago, there were thousands of Norwegians forced to leave the country in search of work, mostly emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% of immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high and extensive care system.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Sweden, the old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, flowing into the country for work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, even though relatively stinking part of Norway in the past.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the more expensive meals on the market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even if everything is expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich you comes to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is the global reports often-and it seems that most people like it that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, the people here still cite with distaste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, the shooting was called `` the event from 22 July. ''</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians may find it hard to believe that, in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The current wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries of the early 70 years of the twentieth century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">`` But the oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well, ''says the plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and blue eyes, surprisingly, a prototype of the Nordic welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as you say, thoughtful people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, like most english people here, it is absolutely fine.</seg>
<seg id="34">Grandstand, we do not like the pomp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway disposes of its oil wealth very carefully-except for a small percentage of most of the money from the industry invested into a special fund for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial meltdown threw money, which had the Norwegians had on its purse strings firmly utažené.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">`` Until we can ski in winter and summer hiking, we are happy, ''says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">`` And eat rakfisk, ''he adds with a laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am standing in the snow in the queue for food-rakfisku have had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">A moose burger is certainly something else, and it's a juicy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening's stinking fish here again.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, in which I live, is one of the many places where made rakfisk dinner where guests choose the best-or, rather, for the most demanding of smell fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have connected with live television coverage, which is the moderator with a bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like a singing contest at Eurovision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">`` What the score is for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene? ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">`` Here's our scorecard, Håvard. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">There was applause and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="48">From his chair to fall man, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe the fumes from all of those fish.</seg>

<seg id="9">`` My government has against the people of Mexico's major commitment in the reduction in violence, ''the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of the week.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he shook hands with the american president, won the president Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Views on a new leader are different in his old home, and a populous state surrounding the capital city.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="32">In the best case, Pena Nieta critics say that when operating in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women.</seg>

<seg id="1">My mexicko american identity crisis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to a lack of options that are in there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them hard times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the last trip to Mexico City I was barely through the crowd and I came into the space for the agenda of immigrants, where I encountered a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for `` Mexicanos ''(` `Mexicans '') and the other for` `Extranjeros'' (`` foreigners '').</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds, and I did not know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in Central California and all my life, I was called `` mexican ''.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as my friends in Boston called `` irish ''and my friends in New York call themselves `` Italy''.</seg>
<seg id="10">So I ended up in the designation `` Mexican American. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, I have a vocabulary of native speakers, and I can not get rid of the american accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out my american passport and stood in line for `` Extranjeros ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about the moment this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">The programme had the usual issues which are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it's the same likelihood that Mexicans remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to join with the United States and Canada and create in North America trading bloc, similar to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">A Pena Nieto has promised that he will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though he did not provide any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relationship with the United States, complicated and full of unpleasant sensations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite the half of the mexican territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So a minute after the representative of the United States to say anything critical about Mexico, you will hear of Mexico in the press and among the elite of the complaint against the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children Montezumy step on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet for Mexico is that the real challenge of the relationship to more than 35 million mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about the hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">That's a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people, the country offers possibilities, and others, no.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with the Mexican roots lives in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in one point of our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, which was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than not, it seemed to fit the profile of this person-dark skin, weak education, the origin of the poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not against Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though we are living the american dream, we go to good schools, and we have got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the american dream, not in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is against the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And beyond that, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class us dislike.</seg>
<seg id="39">The feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently mexican.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is in their view, only about failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico have failed, so it would never leave.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we are now found trapped behind the silken curtain, with the good life in the United States, but even with the lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara in childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that among Mexicans and mexican Americans, there is tension, because it means more Mexicans, who they are, and the mexican Americans resent it.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And, at the same time, many mexican Americans, you know, feel like a part of one.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to the mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">To get the best of both countries, but you do not have roots in one.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico on us as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we have considered the Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And that relationship even more complicated, they want some mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, together again with the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to mexican Americans working for Mexico as `` the ambassadors ''and represented the mexican interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our american citizens, how cool is this country to visit, and push for political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Well.</seg>
<seg id="56">It was going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And thanks to the income inequalities and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us is not certain, that it's a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That's fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States will act with Mexico in front of one and a half century, so must accept the fact that some mexican Americans still feel uncomfortable for the way in which he was treated with their family in the near past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we are more `` Mexicans ''than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battle, the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Closure of fire between Israel and Hamas could yet be a basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is futile.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, many of the buildings was amended in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. and for the first time rockets from the Gaza Strip landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolitan areas, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even if it seems that Israelis and Palestinians stranded in its ancient conflict around the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, they are caught up in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe it will cause that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war is not won or lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems, is currently the many reasons to optimizmu.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire closed 21 November last fight this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leader of Hamas, the islamic movement, which rules the Gaza Strip since 2007, will argue that the Israelis forced to retreat, though Gaza suffered a defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most populous corners of the planet and nejžalostnějších, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">And indeed, Hamas acquires the influence of the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his ardent rivals from the Fatah umírněnější palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well decide that the time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">Islamists across the arab world have more influence, so Hamas won a powerful and wealthy friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a regional power, which was once an ally of Israel's closest Muslim, joined the party Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jubilant people from Hamas say that islamic crescent circle around the north of Israel, Lebanon, where the party rules / militia Hezbollah, Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to unseat Bashar Assad islamizmu may, to Jordan, where Hamas' s allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on the southern flank Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and core arab countries, the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future the diplomacy may occur Hamas as a player who can not be excluded either Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Conversely, israeli hardliners reach opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system to prove his worth and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis can sleep better-for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, America is as solid as ever, many european countries also blaming Hamas from the start of the latest round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And the mainly-Israel prospered, in particular, under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was in Israel fairly quiet from suicide bombers, in part thanks to the wall, which interferes with the western shore, the main part of what might be a palestinian state, and protects the jewish settlements, which are still growing despite his unlawful before the international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections of January 22, together with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians, giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you really ruled on the West Bank, the neodpalovali rockets, like their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Maybe the hardliners win, but the arab spring may change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt, Israel and other countries do not have too much in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">The israeli defence spending is higher than all of his four arab neighbours together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new arab governments to heal its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">That President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also, the Israelis would be the situation should look in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a denial of rights of Palestinians to self-determination of the barrel with gunpowder, who must one day in areas occupied by Israel to explode-as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">Currently the repression of weakening in the jewish state of democracy and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the arab population is growing.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attacks against Gaza the every few years for the purpose of retraction of Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both parties need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is that what they preached sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and these newspapers: two states, Israel referred to the territory for security reasons.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is some hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must stop the supply of weapons into Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and sharing Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs outside must also push for the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be for the creation of a palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer of virtual statehood in the United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its share of it, how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In his first term dereliction of performance of its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House, seems to be equally reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">That means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia, the entry into force of the laws of the bad cigarette packs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The nevzhledných green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted the warnings for smokers and the sick part of the body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The entry into force of the australian laws of the bad packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the colour of logos and brands to replace the general olive green boxes with a gruesome pictures of diseased parts of the body and the display of the children and infants diseased as a result of the smoking of their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are required from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes of brand names, which are printed in the same small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the most stringent regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.</seg>
<seg id="7">He relies on studies show that when people start smoking by the age of 26 years, is a 99% chance that never start smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">`` Even in very small children, you can see, that means the message of the tobacco companies to jointly with its product to sell, ''says Federal Minister for Health and Tanya Plibersek cites studies, for example, have shown that the children of joining the crown in the logo with the idea of what it takes to be a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest levels of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to lower-priced and dostupnějším cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">`` This legislation is a serious neúmyslným consequences, ''says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia have brought much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others argue that the laws have increased their shops.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand on cigarette packaging of silicon used to cover the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal on laws to Australia's Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha, stated that the company Zico sold almost 6 000 wholesale sellers and expects the new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, it is a good deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a potential setback experts argue the popularity of social media in that demographic group, which focuses on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a whole series of australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that the majority of vendors and cigarettes before the direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia banned the online advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but can not restrict foreign websites.</seg>
<seg id="21">`` If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry, and you have only this little room for the promotion of your products, is for you online space intractable place in which you want to be, ''says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mrs Freeman recorded an increase in the assessment of the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by `` mediocre crawfish. ''</seg>
<seg id="23">We need to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave the work and made this video, or that are involved in the company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia, argues that the industry focused on how to deal with the new rules, than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has gone so far that paid in Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new regulations-countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation, declaring that the trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly traded.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision rendered SOO is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek, says that the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country in 2001 introduced mandatory alert photograph.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The stricter laws think Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia he resists.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pictures I have no influence.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">`` You just pull out a cigarette box and put back, ''says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of the tumour in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, there's only one reason to quit smoking, and it's my little girl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, who owns trafiku King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, argues that, thanks to the uniform packs for him is hard to match the shelves.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world of constant connection is not so bad as to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The last day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane mechanical problems, and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait for half a day at the airport on the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iphone (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts in child development increasingly come with praise for the nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that for us (and our children) is good sometimes bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">It makes the brain to go to interesting directions, which may encourage creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And whereas most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we do not have the chance to enjoy the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So we should support the boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I will come back to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, says Peter Toohey, a professor of greek and roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, who is the author of the book: Boredom and lively history (the history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">`` In fact, he has a long history of boredom, ''he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii was found in the latin inscription on the boredom, originating in the first century AD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, ''said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After seeing the research literature and bringing the idea of the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as experience `` I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The boredom of apathy differs from that person is involved, but I wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that there is apathy of the urge to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that the core of the boredom is a `` distortion of the process of attention, with a bad mood and feeling slow time. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can remind a lot of depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a relationship have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, he sees the problem within ourselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think we are boring, when we have trouble with concentration.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study, `` the Unengaged Mind: defining Boredom in terms of attention '', which was published in September in perspectives on Psychological Science journal, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, the person who read an article from the magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard loud and related to the television program in the next room, others heard him so low that it barely noticed, while a third group heard at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard the television program quietly, reported the boredom of greater than the other two groups-had problems with concentration, but were not sure why these difficulties and attributed to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you are trying to focus on the difficult task of distortion or engaging, can lead to boredom attention, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, if you are doing something boring, `` as is the search for the bad parts on sidin line, may help rozptylující music, so bored. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, we now know that kroucení and čmárání, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, may actually help with boredom and fight to keep people physically attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">`` Research shows that children who are allowed to shake, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still, ''said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All we have ever experienced boredom-delay in my flight, roaring speaker, especially the lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals have a greater chance of getting bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">For help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980 s, developed the `` scale for susceptibility to nudění ''(Boredom Proneness Scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Scale includes questions like: `` many of the things I need to do, repeated and is monotonous, ''and `` I have so many interests, that I do not have the time to do it all.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">By using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida and, in particular, the need to have more and different external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Teenagers are, however, generally impassive.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of adolescents indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.</seg>
<seg id="44">He said, however, that he knows that `` growing up is the peak period for boredom '', which is largely due to the fact that the children and young people is not given much control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: `` it's good for you boring? ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form may lead people to undergo a grotesque physical risks, playing games or using addictive substances, as a way to mitigate it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed on the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem after more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">`` Boredom is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else, ''said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always know the most useful thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you are watching tv, do you joy just for a moment, not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child bored and you give the iPad, I will not get bored, but to learn how to attach itself or separately, said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">`` And this separate procedures is transmitted from one situation to the other, ''he said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child is only to learn how to attach itself, but the gains greater restraint in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we are not even against her should not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our objective should rather feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant chatter and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">`` We are accusing her of the need to get bored more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful, ''he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's what people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the free time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">`` In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní, ''he said, `` it's hard to find ways to be seized, when the noise shuts down.''</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado, there's no manual on the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and soccer player from the south-east of Colorado, facing a charge of crime for something that will soon be in the whole state legal-for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Orozco said that one day the September rode with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains, near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drug paraphernalia and the use of drugs-petty crimes, which is fine for every $100-and he was set the date of the court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">`` They treated us like criminals, ''said Mr Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it's a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the weeks after the vote on the Colorado legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use depends on the answer of hundreds of smaller drug cases, rather than on the spot on the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police departments stopped blaming the adult in the age of 21 years and older for possession of small quantities, which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in the District of Colorado konzervativnějších declared that will continue with existing cases involving marihuany, and still blame people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains votes on the prevention of the opening of the new state licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">`` This matter is evolving so quickly that I do not know what's going to happen, ''said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The heads of the hall-jogging and regulators in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="14">And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale of all-the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use, and now even recreational.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">`` Colorado has regulovanější market, so it will be a good guide, ''said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences to sell alcohol in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or the system can not do more than design, what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">`` There is no real precedent for us to follow, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Washington's law, the so-called I-502, becomes effective on December 6, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will be another state licensing system, but the legal possession, yes.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are zapeklité mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the directive to state on the `` appropriate approach ''to the licensed marijuana with his trade ban with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">`` There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, and in particular in the Seattle metropolitan area, ''said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora officers e-mail, in which he announced that the city's already will not prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen in the age of 21 years and that the police `` with immediate effect ''to stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police will promote the city laws regulating the growers of medical marijuana, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the district of Weld in Northern Colorado represents the District Attorney Ken Buck stricter look.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, many of them facing another charge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">`` Our office is obliged to prosecute crimes charges, which were offences at a time when they occurred, ''said Mr Buck in its statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was complicated, in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, already grown-up blaming for possession of small amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">District Attorney Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all ongoing cases of possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">`` I do not think that I am losing my time continuing in law enforcement, until the change, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of voters supported coloradských measure, bringing the recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system is never easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For the county prosecutors, it is `` the cultural barrier, ''said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, which stands accused of possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organisation for the reform of the laws concerning the marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">`` They spent so much of his life in his prosecution of people that still can not really accept that it's legal, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states to a small quantity of marijuana as opposed to alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become a national test cases for the legalization of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and government authorities plan a new frontier for legalizovaný sale and also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which still has the plan as the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates for legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice to cave in.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use that drew attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and the other 16 states in the operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While the drug-enforcement agents agents are likely to break down the door to catch a small bag with a drug, it is likely that the rebel providing State regulated business with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, said Kevin Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drug policy administration of President Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several coloradských cities for the procedure to federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, though it will take more than a year, he will be able to open any trade.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the city of Montrose in the western part of the state, proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">`` We do not want to find yourself in a situation where someone's head and then we will have a big federal, ''said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community voted against this addition.</seg>
<seg id="46">We look at it, what they voted for the municipality, contrary to what the state has voted.</seg>
<seg id="47">There are many questions.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me usmrkaným wimp.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institution such intimidation and venom.</seg>
<seg id="95">More tragic, however, is that it was the Oxford, of which not only produced 14 conservative prime ministers, but also to date, hiding behind the reputation of the place undue with equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="4">That's the case, one of the Anta Wijayi 400 miners who make their living by the conquest of the sulphur volcano on the indonesian island of Kawah Ijen East Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because every day until fárat at the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the country and in contact with air passes into a solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the cut in large blocks of sulphur, weighing up to 70 pounds, takes them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets after steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the top of the mountain, which rises 2 386 yards, it's only 250 metres, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes up tortoise pace up because they hold the balance and thoroughly rozvažují steps to neuklouzli and crashing into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any confusion, it could become a life, how it happened one French turistce that years ago fell from cliffs Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every pound of sulphur that mine</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When you are at the top, making their way past the tourists, who took photographs of them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, carrying heavy baskets and wearily to the weight of the mining company placed somewhat lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which benefit from a volcano in 1960 and never pay their workers more than 662 indonesian rupees (five cents) a kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) in the petrochemical industry, as this rock has its place in the day-to-day life and is used for the production of matches, amusing pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">`` Because they are commonly worn 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million) for each way, ''explains us anto, which usually carried three trips a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way it takes three hours, and at the end of it is damaged, but he can then earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems like a negligible amount so inhuman effort, it's three times what they would have earned on the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">`` The daily wage of miners here is very high, for example, for the collection of coffee to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for a fortnight's two million rupees (167), ''explains the porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary, 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was so heavy, but anto returned with her family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as Sulphur: `` I am married with a young girl from Bali, which is a Hindu, and I took her to Java, converted to Islam.

<seg id="24">Shares of dirty wooden shack with other media and every day gets up at two in the morning, because sulfur in the night and continues to ooze out of her characteristic yellow color changes in blue and glow in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the surrounding darkness into the crater and fárá anto lights the way a small lamp, which has a fixed on his helmet and he bought it for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 delivery order on the shoulders of the basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has high revenues, the extraction of sulphur due to cost savings nezmechanizovala or porters working on his own and with such zeal, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually, do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the bonus for photography, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1,2) collected watchers of the National Park from the tourists who come to photograph a volcano and her human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">`` This work is for cattle, and not for people, ''argues Madrusin, a 42 year-old carrier, who works in Kawah Ijen already for three decades, ever since he left school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that the last work, `` as long as possible '', because he needs the money for the education of their three sons, aged between 18 and 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="31">I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulphur burn his throat and eyes sting, when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners in the thick of the fumes from the volcano, based on the miners are so tough that no one of them complaining that suffered serious diseases … but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, pain, knee and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">It may seem that this slogan is part of the advertising peppermint candy, but despite-or perhaps because of it-with the video at the beginning of this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">These sentences are part of the rap, which uses local hints of `` bun in the oven ''as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">BUT, the advertising agency that created the video, hopes that this advertising can highlight the problem of humorous manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The art director of the Agency's Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music for people to meet their `` civic duty ''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">`` It is only a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject which need to touch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government is trying to extend a lot of things like perfume with pheromone or organise seznamovací parties.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why not make that nejkreativnější thing, as is the composition of the rap to solve this problem. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It's taken too lightly, is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">A year makes 1 USD 300 to encourage citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The government package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">All of these measures but had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in south-east Asia, also known as conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time the fertility rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered to be a degree of recovery, in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why Singapurci have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Mingová, Director of the Department of marriage and the family of the National Office for the population, says that it's because of the `` education ''and `` a wider range of career opportunities''.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">`` People are available to a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, it's only a wedding and family, ''he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social standards contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and fathered children. the result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">While the immigration policy, there were attempts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against a decline in population between residents of this caused resentment.</seg>
<seg id="28">On some of the Singapore website is to see the overt xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and little attempt to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year recorded a party of government in Singapore on your worst election result since the beginning of independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election appeared to tackle the problem by using quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in the birth rate has known the impact of the national economic growth, tax revenue, healthcare spending and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government tries to be erected so many small houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, began to affect the real estate business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as `` the shoebox '', which could be built in some urban areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These flats have area 46 square meters and had great success in marketability.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that these flats can support the bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, director-general developer company El Developers, says that their `` shoeboxes ''sold far faster than the larger houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">`` They are increasingly popular, and that it will be sold in the days to weeks faster than houses with greater scale.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, they are our cash flow much better. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, the new standards provide clearer rules for developers, who were previously limited, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too stressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is the city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the centre of the city, suggests that they will not have a big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">`` People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, that many people back, ''says the young officer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">`` The rest of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="47">But it's important for me to rely on their own time and money, ''says another, about 20-year-old, young man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So the government is trying to citizens in any way to force them to have children, they are still ultimately Singapurci, who have the last word on the founding family.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the digital natives and digital immigrants, led these concepts to this phenomenon explained.</seg>
<seg id="43">`` Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We are the digital immigrants, who they have to learn, and he only teach themselves, ''he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that it is a difficult subject, `` because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what not, in an age when you are not yet mature. ''</seg>
<seg id="46">Also, what concerns the surroundings-slow, at a time when it most wants is to be popular, thousands of friends and not think about the consequences, ''he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Under this specialistky is the most effective way to children and adolescents to show what it's privacy, asking questions, making them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">`` Tell them to do something, it does not work, ''he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that are stranger listened, then why are you doing it on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: would you like it if someone posted a picture of you as you published a comrade?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the others published?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you call the person in the photos of the celebrations, did you ask these persons on permission?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more: the need to know what they are doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to realize that they have to act in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It's the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">`` The man is out of respect for the Internet, morals and other principles and the same should be on social networks, ''he says.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="57">Supervision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant, explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">`` If you understand the intricacies of every single, have a good basis to children, talking about the consequences of the account on the internet can have.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish, ''he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe '</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the objective, in which the `` South America, in this case really must learn from Europe. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who was involved in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations Presidential (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television tv Perú that Europeans, `` kill the World War ''and in other conflicts, `` but now they are practically one country.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, defended the project of a south american citizenship, the member countries of the Organisation of Unasur support.</seg>
<seg id="5">`` It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any country, which is already underway between members of the Andean Community, however, there are more reactionary areas that we want to go back to the past, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Ecuadorian President, inter alia, that he agrees with the reorganisation of the Organisation of American States (OAS) under the condition that it be reduced the influence of anglo-saxon countries and take into account those who signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">`` Those who are in the lead, never to oblige, and we all signed the South Americans instead.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is inconceivable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, financed by the United States, ''he said, referring to the political asylum by Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">President Correa, confirmed that this decision does not regret, because it had betrayed their principles, and respected his `` deep democratic values and human rights ''.</seg>
<seg id="10">Said at the time that there was `` credible allegations that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, criticised the swedish justice, who asked him to the swedish territory subjected the testimony of alleged sexual offense, while `` the swedish legislation makes the questioning of videokonferenčním conversation, which might take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there is a risk that Assangeho worsening physical and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="13">`` I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but Ambassador informed me that he has little lung problems, but nothing serious, ''said Ecuador's head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">`` But that his physical and psychological condition worsens, because it is closed on a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.</seg>
<seg id="15">That would mark the health of everyone, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June on ekvádorském embassy in London, on the basis of the permit, which enables him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, and stressed that the London talks to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">`` We are not negotiating on human rights, that word in this case to use, but still continued talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads the series of proceedings at the various european instances, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Stated that `` if Britain issues to pass, will all end. ''</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears the ekvádorském embassy in London or via Skype, as no problem on its legislation and, as has been done in other cases, this problem will be carried out. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took advantage of the situation to be presented as a defender of the freedom of the press, and explained that, certainly not tolerate `` podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, that undermine the freedom of expression. ''</seg>
<seg id="22">The greatest enemies of a free press, are not we, the mean-spirited and perverse politicians, but the bad press in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">From this point of view, expressed joy that no such journalists, `` not the bankers, not hegemonní countries and even buržoazie proficient in Ecuador, ''and said that, if elected, `` will continue to change by the right way and in the right direction.''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">President Correa also supported the decision on maintaining the veto of the equivalent of Paraguayi on Union membership Unasur, at least in its next election, arguing that the whole `` must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus wrapped into the legality '', because, in fact, `` destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Ecuadorian President also alleged that as `` entirely appropriate ''wish of his colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the period after the judgment of the international court in the Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Currently, the judgment is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">`` It's a problem between the south american country and the Central American.</seg>
<seg id="28">The conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">They need to be assessed, to be overcome and the possibility to go forward. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It also expressed the hope in the settlement of the maritime border, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that `` for Latin America's right to seek international instances, if both countries commit to accept the judgment, no matter how much hard. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, to run in the order of a third mandate, he said, that he sees this option `` with great optimism and joy, even when it is sometimes very hard. ''</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that, if in February 2013 choice loses, leaves from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">`` Personally, I never cared much, but as unfair situation as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, he can repair the only political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">My political movement believed that it was I who guarantees this likely victory, so we have to take this responsibility, ''he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">`` If I had won, it would be my last presidential term, and then I went from the policy.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, I am going to be the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="37">I had already decided, ''he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also mentioned on the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">`` I just spoke with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez went on a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1">AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabriziovi was 21 years, when it was confirmed the result of his test: HIV positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">`` It was like a bolt of lightning struck me, ''he says, remembering the moment of truth, the doctor tried to `` softening '', but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy before the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his disease alone on their shoulders, and began to inform it with such commitment that he celebrated his birthday. 43.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of the patients nejdávnějších unit of HIV in the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after a battle with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which were unimaginable in the early 1990 s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, with even the director of the clinic in Mexico's Institute of Social Security (IMSS) farewell, `` because he had cut ''.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and to live.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it's a lot of people who do not know about my illness and come up when the virus caused the destruction of the organism in himself and the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since the world appeared disease AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, `` means a great success, that the life expectancy of the patient, timely and appropriate manner with treatment, is exactly the same as in healthy people, ''said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the unit of HIV in the civilian hospital in Guadalajara, that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that the scientists concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability in the immune system, which is the illness diagnosed, the better they are on those who use drugs: people with 200 cd 4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cd 4 cells for up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Put simply, this means that those who have been diagnosed with HIV in 25 years, according to these knowledge `` in compliance with the therapy to live without the problems of up to 75 years, ''explained in an interview with the doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To highlight this progress, it should be noted that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although mortality significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the yearbook of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the discovery of the AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year, yet 187. however, since 2005, is to ensure universal access to antiretroviral.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why do you continue to people on the consequences of the disease die?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> `` It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The way I see it, that's the way it is with us in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">For at least the past 12 years, we have exhausted supplies of the drug problem is that patients come in very advanced stage, because they do not know the status of the disease, or in a late stage of the disease. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds a convincing entry: `` nine out of ten patients comes, he will take some associated infection. the only thing, what needs to be done in order to affect the overall mortality rate is more illness before the diagnosis, and therefore should be on a large scale to offer tests to assess the disease to all persons who request it. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal coincides with the specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the State of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to get into the private lab tests, just because it made his friend, and despite the low age he had a disease outbreak of AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, cancer, which is one of the most common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">`` Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think they will die, and they do not want to know anything else.</seg>
<seg id="26">`` If I have to die, I'd rather be vyřádím three times a week, ''they said, but it's not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. ''</seg>
<seg id="28">Still, his parents knew only that he had suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">`` I live a normal life like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="30">I work, I have a lot of activities, travel, lead an active sex life, but in a responsible manner, I pay attention to himself and to the other person, ''lists Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share their experience on the MILENIO Jalisco, today in the context of World AIDS Day motivated the testimony of those who are afraid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">`` Let them keep do tests if risk, let them know as soon as possible if you are HIV positive, it's better, and if you have been diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, he will be responsible. ''</seg>

<seg id="38">`` What do you want it? ''is the question of the normal full of irony and assessment from social workers, school employees, consultants, pharmacies and medical personnel, the teenagers want to avoid, says the reporter.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested this ineffective distribution of condoms are not just change, whether for consoles, but those hundred whether located in dávkovačích public toilet, in places frequented by young.</seg>
<seg id="40">`` It's promoting promiscuity.</seg>

<seg id="1">The ruling by the Court of Appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company's bankruptcy in vitro by Grupo Mexico, causing an unfortunate precedent for any national firm with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Therefore, it appears that the procedures of the restructuring of the companies, which allow mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes, despite international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The approval of the judgment on 15 June last year the judge Hal Harlinem in bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves in the practice of the mexican company without defence against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the ruling opens the mexican producer of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First, it should be noted that while the judge in this case, they argue that creditors by the Insolvency Act in the United States, the Court of Appeal the fifth district, located in New Orleans, says that the main procedure provides the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For one thing, it would indicate a procedural ignorance of international cooperation in cases of insolvency, the multinational companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, he was the model for this purpose, created by the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which determines the arbiter of the organisation of the American Law Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgment that without a vote of the branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company in vitro to branches, would not be required majority for approval of the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the possibility of the mexican laws allow.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fact is that the case was not the first company in vitro, in which it was taken this scheme.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose in-house debts guaranteed Federal Institute of insolvency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, the truth is that even after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors-who stood against the company in a court in the United States, i. e. funds `` vultures '', such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited-have a majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another viewpoint accuses the court in the company of a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008-against the background of a serious economic crisis, which hit the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, the family firm Superior set lodges an appeal to the new assessment directly at the court of appeal to the examination was carried out with the full participation of the participation of the five judges, as originally voted only three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">If he fails, it will require a revision of the appeal process, a higher instance, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case is serious, that the court failed to document sent by the mexican government as a department of the amicus curiae, which is described in detail in vitro procedure the company under bankruptcy law and in which it points out that the company will ease, opted for the agreements signed by both countries, confronted the law with chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Navícse points out that the country is subordinate to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories of the history of the local basketball, as has the Héctor `` Hetin ''Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">`` I served in the course of my life in a lot of basketball roles, including several at the same time as I was when I was in the 1990 s, the president of the National League BSN, General manager of the national team and the chairman of the Federation, ''recalled Reyes while visiting reporters newspaper Primera Hora home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.</seg>
<seg id="6">`` Basketball was my life. ''</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes in his assertion exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and objects from his long career, that story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the heart of Bayamón</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the greatest affection from all those guards, reminiscent of his tenure in Los Vaqueros since the mid-1950, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time to celebrate 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">`` It was my best years, that I am the most houses, because I had the opportunity to be with a team of Los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in eight championship, either as the owner, the co-owner, or the coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I am one Championships-in 1981, when the BSN debuted Jerome Mincy.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the team took over `` Cuco ''Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader,'' said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">`` I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach and then worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me:'I am for you, the burly 6-foot player.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want it? ''</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow me then recommended rozehrávače Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that he said that, if Mincy Bayamonu bring victory in the championship, then Gausse will contribute to the further. ''</seg>

<seg id="21">At that time, he wanted to devote their functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">`` I remember the first time we beat the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we are, but we had to have the bronze if it had not been for the canadian referee, who let us repeat the final face-off, ''said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best of the national team, which you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, like the one that defeated the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the national team in panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we are the team out of the United States, which was quite similar to that which we blew a bronze at the World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">The crew should not only Mincyho Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and `` Piculína ''(Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) `` Toñito'' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario `` Quixote ''Morales, who could be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which might have the perfect composition, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, a team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in argentine Neuquénu.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the players on the roster, as they were `` Canito ''Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players excluded because of a scuffle in panamerických games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, won the gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It was without any doubt Ortiz Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="32">His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one from Puerto Rico reached at this level as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to mention his background in different leagues, where he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">The young I very much like the work of Leo Arilla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The success of the Federation consider the greatest?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">That I was part of the most famous of the era of the national team in the years from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990 s was the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> What did you do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things I wanted to introduce, as a division of youth categories, according to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that the boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the kids a lot of travel and play games, too, which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">I also see a benefit in the compulsory certificates and courses for managers, assistants and the referee.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am pleased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I enjoy the grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketbalové games.</seg>
