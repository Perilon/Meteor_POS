<h1>
<seg id="1">The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justify their policy of necessity in the fight against electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brennan's Centre, however, indicates that fraud as a myth that election fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after lightning struck.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican lawyers, in the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike in the US, Canada has the responsibility for the organisation of federal elections of individual states.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in this spirit, the majority of American governments since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult to process the election or registration on the electoral roll.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has the expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 of restrictive electoral law in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws restrict the period for the elections in advance, override the right to register on the list of voters on election day and odnímají electoral law the registration of citizens with criminal records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to present photo identification with půkazu no American state.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first state that this requirement, it was Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutionality of the indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican officials hurried to the enlargement of the procedure, as well as in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states, with the aim of forcing voters to submit identity cards with photographs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It should be noted that, unlike the Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, owns 11% of American citizens, that at the age of 21 million people to vote, no identity card with a photograph issued by a government authority of their country.</seg>
<seg id="20">It does not have an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years old, therefore, does not have the required identity card with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, who are known for their voters to shift to Democratic candidates in several states are not entitled to use their identity card with a photograph issued by his school.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates, the cards issued by these clubs to use in the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, the state did not require any proof of citizenship before the election.</seg>
<seg id="28">The first such a requirement in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 2011, about a dozen states have laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">Obviously, these measures are aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.</seg>
<seg id="31">It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Republican legislators in 2011 to support laws in eight states, with the registration of voters on election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions have their consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters for registration of approximately 10 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures taken after 2009 but has caused a decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%.</seg>
<seg id="39">For Hispanics, it was the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of people voting in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, there were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Against the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly built Democratic legislators and their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Democratic governors veto blocked several bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">Some of them have managed to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, the laws requiring the submission of the identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.</seg>
<seg id="47">The newly introduced rules, however, is undeniably impedes the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics are talking mainly about bias approved laws and consider them to be an obvious attempt to influence the results of the election in 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">Brennan's Centre in 2011, the report shows that the states where such laws were approved, represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain already: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the American democratic system.</seg>

<seg id="1">The detection of prostate cancer: Complete examination or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">PSA test was sometimes incorrect results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of this has increased the reluctance of the men, who are already reluctant to go to the test at all.</seg>
<seg id="4">To investigate or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked two experts on the view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the US has shown a high level of contamination among the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time in Europe, said the different mortality rates among patients who have undergone tests, and those who did not go to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also showed the 12letém distance that those who do not go to the test, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men are also more at risk of African-American origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is to take the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are aggressive forms of cancer, and such species that are inert.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is therefore necessary to explain to the patient's level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him a possible alternatives, necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which is in the long-term impact on life, and in these cases focus more on active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men who had been diagnosed with cancer cure, as their type of cancer is aggressive and threatens them for life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, they propose the implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More and more frequently and with greater precision establishing criteria, which will help in deciding which type of treatment and which do not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, I recommend the tests.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to have an interview with the doctor and determine whether or not it is appropriate to take the tests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Companies in cooperation with the International urologickou Movember movement has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with PSA testing.</seg>

<seg id="21">The prevention of disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risk of disease of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving enough, you could prevent up to 30% of the cases of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If they stop smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">A percentage also remains completely unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Cancer Society remains a priority in the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a risk factor for several others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is extremely harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," spokesman Andre Beaulieu, shaking his head.</seg>
<seg id="33">An encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of death from cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The mass of</seg>

<p>
<seg id="35">The SCC stoutness and obesity are another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon," says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nutrition for the</seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">The too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is best to avoid the sausages, for which the same applies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Preserving meat, smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"May cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent times, various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Research, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Studies on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Although, according to one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies suggest the increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is not clearly established.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Higgs boson examined</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosonu likely caused a stir last summer.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then there is the last particle whose existence was predicted the standard model - our best, or "least bad" explanations of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Among the physicists, however, so far there is no 100 percent certainty that it is the Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no doubt that we have an entirely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as predicted in the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">New data released this week during a physical congress in Kyoto to confirm the absence of any data yet, so that we can have absolute certainty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, let's assume that it is the Higgs boson, because of the risk of error appears to be small, and look at what's happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world there is a definite law, according to which the two things cannot be at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">This rule cannot be ignored - and don't try too hard, otherwise you're gonna get hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Although it is a very strange world of particle physics, it turns out that there is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Particle physicists further divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently comply with Pauli principles.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the other end of the range bosony, anarchists, who weighs nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they may still be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: Mesony here we go unnoticed, and "force particles," which is the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, to say that these bosony are not as exotic pets, how could be considered.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you read this article, it is thanks to bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or "particle of light," which is "a" electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">When particles with electric charge to accelerate or change their direction, "disturbed" by the electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "distraction" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than the photon - and thus one of bosonů, "of the force."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">But it's also the Higgs bosonem, except that "interrupt" should be another field, Higgsovo field that this boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the excitation should be to achieve very high energy values, such as the frozen surface of a pond, which moves a lot of a large boulder.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator CERN accelerator in the laboratory as part of the Large Hadron Collider - the friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop that kind of energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field, throw us again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not react with the electromagnetic field, all the particles and all materials.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be itself to stick on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And it is true that the Higgs field do not respond with all the particles: Those that do have some mass, while others (such as the photon, look at him) don't have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Mrs Smith asks what all of these studies are what "us"?</seg>
<seg id="29">From the point of view of science is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between observations and predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, many physicists have literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and close some of the gaps in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It should be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of the matter (oops!).</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, however, the CERN facilities such contradictions there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Response of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The response of these research in everyday life Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Behold: At the beginning of the 1960s pioneers laser at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution, will have their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Assumed the scientific use, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous light pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy in the lab."</seg>
<seg id="38">Just imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides, it can also result from the application of all the tools that surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Willard Boyle has created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">This scanner, though it Boyle first as planned, now serves as the "eye" of the digital cameras in the world and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activity around the LHC is bound to change your life, but it does mean that you really never know.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care - the best way to go through life... | Le devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through its Commission for dying with dignity, Quebek recently engaged in a delicate questions regarding the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate should continue, and at the same time, the bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this crucial area, there is still a lot of work to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">The magazine Le devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Less than a couple of weeks ago Mr L. still alone in his apartment in Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, which was consuming him, gave him a two-year reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me five years of life, and it's seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease has done its work: The extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself to the toilet or feed himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Resignation is looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a bold and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop for him, bringing him drugs, offer a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, he humiliated me," she says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In all my life and learn that the guys in the urine," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">To return to the stage of the child is for some people an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on a person's abilities," whether to accept the return, says psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a number of people involved in palliative care, the crucial moments are taking place in the heart of such a return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who are at home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">The forecast is for a maximum of three months to live.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, they are a team of doctors and nurses who care for them, provide so-called "therapeutic" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the case of Mrs A, 89 years old, is the worst fear to die of suffocation fully conscious. "</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has allowed me to discover their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good kids," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no desire in my life," he says, and then allow us to put on her breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="27">He enjoys in the coming days on the last visit to a son from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body with the help of nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">It looks like palliative care, which is, if you cannot do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">The death was more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Québeku seems one bed palliative care to 11 700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little, if we realise that we all have to die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors in the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether it is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When a man dies, for example, you can give him a sip of brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics will no longer need to watch the level of sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is a part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night, carrying beer, Mr X, who later died in the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">His son this morning, drinks a beer in honor of the late father.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the home of Victor-Gadbois go days one after the other, but like each other.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to the year old man, who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while his whole in his honor, dying tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children, after having tried all options in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For half a year, there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer in 45 years," says Dr Christiane Martelová with concern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% of hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problems with access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, or to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of the sick, in the final phase of his life, whether it's at home, in a hospital or in a halfway house.</seg>
<seg id="47">And a few organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and Company for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively on the care provided to cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to a number of doctors specialising in palliative care is the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, evidenced by his opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr Christiane Martelové Quebec health-care system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to high-quality palliative care before it can agree with the euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">As he says, has recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the ER in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="52">He fears that patients ask about the killing on the grounds that they do not receive appropriate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, many oncologists care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my onkoložce that I quit with the treatment, said she regrets that I fight, tells us.</seg>
<seg id="56">And he told me that it's over!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to his treating doctors to fill their wish when their team palliative pussy ease the pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it is necessary to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care at the Society for home palliative care the Grand Montréal, the treatment of pain in patients from 8% of the cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of his life, often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whatever fits and starts, or whether they are the sedative administered permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot pretend that we do not see this part of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">The patient, who escape the pain, will have a greater ability to access paliativním sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients who are not given a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me the euthanasia," it means, "I want to get rid of the pain."</seg>

<seg id="3">This "field" came in Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is interesting how the system crumbled since we have taken strong measures," says ironically, Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thanks to him, a scandal erupted in 2011 on the basis of rigorous investigation for embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the former liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest has approved only after long delays.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Duchesneauova report" confirmed a direct link between the industry, the murky financing of parties and corruption of public officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "but the Ministry of Transport to save a billion dollars in contracts," as some people keep in check their instincts to get their share.</seg>

<seg id="12">In recent weeks, carried out a series of searches and accused of fraud and corruption of local councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a municipality from the suburbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is suspected of having repeatedly took bribes in exchange for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Lina Zambito caused a sensation when the commission said the "system" of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="17">During these years he spent 3% of the value of the contracts which v Montréalu, middle-man associated with the Mafia, which then transfer the money to the Union Montréal, for which he was running for Mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">After the year 2000 Zambito was generous to all the parties and gave more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) a provincial parties, but especially the Liberals, who were then in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">He also confessed to organizing the illegal source of funds for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.</seg>

<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: During the 10 years he received from construction companies gifts, invited on trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and spending money in the value of a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with penězovody which nadsazoval price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they pay fees for about 30% to 40% by means of false invoices víceprací.</seg>
<seg id="24">The organizer of the mayor's Martin Dumont then Tremblaye accused of slitting his eyes without embarrassment over the parallel budget that the Treasury was dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which put Montreal in large-scale crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau montrealskými was among the first members who issued a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="27">As Mayor of the Rivière-des-prairies to the east of the island is already from 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promotérům directly in the middle of the prosperous trade in real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The 70% of dirty money in election campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The investigation, which will be finally opened, says that "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrene and načapalo culprits."</seg>
<seg id="30">According to her, "the process is painful, but a positive."</seg>
<seg id="31">We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it is necessary to establish a v Montréalu own investigative unit, and to ensure that these dubious practices could not return.</seg>
<seg id="32">As cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="33">A regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned, in particular the role of "well-informed about this ruse" if those dealing in them!</seg>
<seg id="35">It is estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and with irony, he adds: "I have heard that this is a weak brew of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it will not solve the situation according to him: "As long as strictly restrict campaign spending, dirty money out of politics."</seg>
<seg id="37">It proposes a comprehensive monitoring system of public procurement and the financing of parties, "which we cannot fall; if we focus on the nature of things, we can build on more solid foundations, and with greater control and compliance with the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story defamed the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that all those who scoff at him to look at their own backyard.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season with PSG put a completely new pace.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this development?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into himself, or an entirely new dimension of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">They came to us the big players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day I get next to them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical team helped me a lot, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every day, these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">The games and it's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football, it is all very fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I don't lose my head.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my beginnings in prep school in the INF Clairefontaine after a stopover in Saint-Etienne, I have always pushed for each grade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Taking advantage of a competitive environment, which led Carlo Ancelotti.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is essential.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it follows that a player like me, then more flavor to the game and wants to make maximum power.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti, in connection with my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the hands of the assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And Ancelotti has the final word at the right time?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today has no equal in the first league and is one of the best European coaches.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has vast experience and with top teams won a lot of titles.</seg>
<seg id="24">He also worked with excellent players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I will win in Paris the other titles.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I've had a number of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">How you look at the first part of the season, PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league us Lyon picked up the position.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we remain in tow.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We are very easily to osmifinále.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of your club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, anything can happen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we certainly want to be a match for high-quality European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all, we want to win their qualifying group ahead of Porto, in order to play in retaliation osmifinále at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">PSG may be in the short term, a major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">It is the budget.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Paris to become a major European club, must win titles and go down in history.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, it is not yet.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the financial side of the PSG means that this plan could take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">And it would be a big setback nezvítězit in 1 league as last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, we want to win the league title a lot.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season, we still missing.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win.</seg>
<seg id="48">We had an excellent season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We collected 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Usually, with 79 points, you are a master.</seg>
<seg id="51">But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think that this year it will.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even though the title and the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons to defeat them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what was invested and what we have the players.</seg>
<seg id="56">Absolutely we accept.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is a fact that when home beat Troyes 4-0 and still find something in the newspaper about us, so it's not very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what they want from you people more.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is not, of course, to win 4-0 on each weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to set up a game style.</seg>
<seg id="62">You need to build a team.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season osmifinále, and also have invested large sums of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the invested sums you would expect that you will be in front of the other 15 points ahead.</seg>
<seg id="66">You insult the other clubs and the French league.</seg>
<seg id="67">Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in last year's season, too, with the new PSG moved into the next phase.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how 1 League is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we will be able to smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">It seems as if PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is good that they say that there is a "dependence on Zlatanovi."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful, and that gives a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">To come here and shows that it is the star 1 league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever he has shown that he is a great player, a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our team we respect the man and the players.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people around him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has achieved is really exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This has led others to increase their level of the game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows the other side-by-side growth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How are you going through Euro 2012 with the French representation?</seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I wanted to play in this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, I couldn't play because of the injury, as I had imagined.</seg>
<seg id="84">But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I'm able to play good games and entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="86">And that is what I had hoped for since her team.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today, we owe it to ourselves, to our presence was exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">As you look at the first of the month, Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The results speak for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">In the qualification for MS we are in a good place.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coach selects the top, it is the players around and able to win.</seg>
<seg id="92">That was the Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I don't want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has achieved its goal that we qualified for the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">It's a draw (1: 1) of 16 October in Spain, a solid baseline game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game gave us added confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">We all fought for the team.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before the shock in Spain, I experienced such a game in his career.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Thanks to Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without banks</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on the central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing among the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the context of these technologies, as is often true, there is a clear political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is how virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro...) and secure transfer protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between two pairs of partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bitcoinu rate peaked at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today it is on the border of about 10 dollars (an overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products it is not impressive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on the virtual finance, which came out in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "equal to the current money."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money, such as "credits" used for the procedure in the video game, which one will win the game, or you can buy (and sometimes even back to change).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social networking site Facebook also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each month, but the central authority controls and processes of individual communication.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes of the network to the depositary of current accounts, the controllers, issuers and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How the network works?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses via e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">File of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double key encryption system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key lies in the writing of this new phase of the transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a means of solving the mathematical task of the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the stage of cutting up the file; that is, the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computer "take over" this new transaction and added to her number, then the whole "chop."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find a number that provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is then indestructible displays connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would be to change the print.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the user wanted for the fraud to pay twice for the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network is only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, are divided into two of the reward on a regular basis, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitcoinů in circulation is limited by the number of 21 million, but can be divided up to part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin.</seg>
<seg id="32">The difficulty of the task is also increases with increasing levels of calculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network has had its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and there has been an estrangement between imposed bitcoinů.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The flaw is not in itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, company for the payment of real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this problem is also true for cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">The major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="40">ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current accounts and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, the "huge discounts" were launched.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars have changed," says Jon Holmquist, who works for bitcoinů Coinabul dealing with the transformation of the gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books for the money, he has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but uses a system for verifying the Bitcoin transactions, which are cheaper because of it.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, a managing their identity and so can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to set in the traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">We need to address, which can be a telephone "photograph it and recognize it," explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In its report, the ECB is expected to review the various risks that are now considered to be increased, if this kind of money will be successful.</seg>

<seg id="15">Kabul was empty, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their taking control of the country was regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghans have paid the price for the ignorance of these villagers, which completely dominated by Al-K 'Ido, their situation has not improved, however, in our time.</seg>

<seg id="42">Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no minerals can take place.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese already almost left Mes Aynak copper mine and left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the possibility of a large Buddhist area, to preserve the role of the major employer in the province.</seg>

<seg id="1">Difficult to work on the Egyptian constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">President Muhammad Mursí went to another poker game.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the promulgation of the Constitution, which temporarily granted unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday, he announced, without regard to the views of all the others, that the Constituent Assembly approved the final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less than a week ago by the head of state of this the next two months to complete the work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">For nearly two years, Egypt is a text, which was often supplemented, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to legal controversies.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the perspective of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," continues to "violates his word" and "tramples on the right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">His supporters, however, have been assured that it is a means to quickly deal with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">In two weeks, there should be a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the Egyptians to clarify the text article by article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way to achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country by the protests.</seg>
<seg id="13">He confirmed in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people with an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or you have unlimited powers," which otherwise would have ended after the approval of the new constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of a constitutional assembly approved the text with a large majority of Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the Liberals in the vote was missing.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, bouchli doors that do not have the opportunity to promote their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Defenders of human rights, civil society, or members of religious minorities in their step.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning, quickly followed by 11 people from among the members.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution have often voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators have also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the clock in the conference room are not properly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was voted on last night, is composed of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The subject of widespread attention, Article 2, is consistent with the final version of the 1971 constitution and states that "the principles of sharia law is the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties for the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term "principles" by the term "rules," which would allow stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not repaired, is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy," argue the liberals, who see it as just a problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Focusing in particular on the article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar advisory role, especially for control of the conformity of laws with Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disturbing, because "people are not competent to make choices and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see this as the beginnings of theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Liberals fear even more stirring up the fact that the next president of the University should be less moderate than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"For now, there was no specific religious consequence.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution remains in Egypt by the state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university researchers, many of them trained in French schools, "is tempered by concern Alexis Blouet, who prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="36">They agree, however, that "there may be differences over the interpretation of Article 220, because it used the terms belongs to a religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">In particular, there is a reference to the "fiqh" (Islamic jurisprudence, but doable).</seg>
<seg id="38">And it may occur in the future, the question of to what extent they are civilian judges competent to be able to express. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Yesterday approved the text is in addition to the religious aspects of very criticized because of the expanded powers, which gives the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: The powers conferred on the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the leaders of the army will be verification of the defence budget to Parliament, but the National Council of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Then there will be prohibited in the military courts proceedings with civilians, as requested by the association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">This association is in connection with the text, which is directed against freedom of its misgivings.</seg>
<seg id="45">The crime of blasphemy is retained and an insult to the disabled, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">No article is also involved in the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová from Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, it is the only positive point of the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president was speaking last night in a television speech, rallies are scheduled for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state will manifest on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The great and powerful" in Moscow: Emigrants would save money on language</seg>

<seg id="2">While members of parliament and human rights activists are still debating the law on compulsory language tests in the country have already discovered the fraudsters who sell "fake" certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities in 13 million foreign workers each year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their sole purpose is to earn enough money to support families back home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On 1 December came into force the law, according to which each migrant workers will be required to pass the test of knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="8">The FMS, however, promises that the time the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The test, however, will consist not only of the language skills, but also in Russian history and of the foundations of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will also be necessary to confirm to obtain and extension of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">And this law does not apply to people who have successfully managed to get an academic degree and diploma in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits, and the protection of the rights of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The test sites will be working under the auspices of The Institute of the Russian language, University of friendship between peoples, Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants may consist of tests in all cities; in Russia today is open to more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to support the introduction of testing support and members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).</seg>
<seg id="17">But before the law came into force, many human rights defenders in the press to ask the question: What's really bring?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, are representatives of migration services - will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the "slave labour."</seg>
<seg id="20">Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says chairman of the board of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems arise in emigrants without occupation, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without the knowledge of the language, he says with conviction Sebelev - is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with dishonest people who will help him on the pretext of "reference" to the awful, cramped quarters where he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents and work for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In their homeland, they promise one thing, but after the arrival of a lover, seized their passports, paid the promised wages," confirms the main Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Don't scold!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to go, but do not have the experience or even with the work.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it wasn't their fault, but rather the disaster: Very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, shoes and remember to school.</seg>
<seg id="31">As children mature into adulthood, they must go to work at the first opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Do you feel the humiliation and inferior."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is true that with regard to the language tests indicate human rights defenders on one important thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you have not, so they won't pass the test, or they don't get any other official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers as well as before in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or No admission for unauthorised entry prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of those workers say that to gain official status in our country is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the legalization costs money: From 12 to 16 thousand roubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the Russian police know that we are, in fact, false documents, no registration, and there are cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Call for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - shared with reporters about his experience, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the validity of the language, it was found that migrants are not only false documents for registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">Staff of the FMS already confiscated several fake certificates of completion of the tests.</seg>
<seg id="48">Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners were not free: Each of the migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with the tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is two and a half times higher than the official test is completed, it will become migrant workers three thousand roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The main task of the immediate future is to secure the system against corruption that workers could not simply buy the documents, that the same government officials as well as defenders of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="52">Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who can't handle tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed a course in the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="53">For visitors who can't speak Russian, is expected to work in the areas in which does not require an active negotiations with people.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The other type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen criminals for representatives of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal "mainly" comes into the sale of military stores.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many of the military warehouses often leads to explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There is evidence that some of the fires were set deliberately, in order to cover the shortages," says a former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">His contribution to bring in the words Barance and producers of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"At present, there are private armaments companies that are not competitive in the international market, and the decommissioning of weapons, which are on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of "black market" is smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is their production, sometimes weapons produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which was organised by their continued production," explains the former soldier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where is the gun?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The experts made, what is the approximate percentage of the sources of supply of illegal weapons in the "black" market.</seg>
<seg id="32">A report on this issue come up in 2011, the Center analysis of the problems and the design of public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Reports of the Ministry of the Interior and specialists dismantled Russian Statistical Office, kriminologickou literature and public data portals focused on the theme of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, comes from the military and the executive.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market "because of the officials, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data, which are available to researchers, 17% of weapons from the armed conflicts, in 14% of the cases, the theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The salesman-consultant to one of the firearms, who asked that his name not, is convinced that the weapons found in the "black" archaeologists dig long ago nobody is buying - they are simply too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most often, he says, the sales drive for new shipments directly to military depots.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ensign was interested in buying the unit, for example, the TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">You have a weapon with him, and he will sell it to you over the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"That will take her to the city, where it sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The truth is that the police are well on track, and therefore they will burn the plan at any time in the detection rate for offences carry out the purchase of traders in illegal weapons," says the adviser.</seg>

<seg id="1">Workers are on strike in the US, and supermarket fastfoodů</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The work on the premises, "McDonald" goes through to a quarter of all American teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the last few days in America raised a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Wal-Mart and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one can predict whether this wave into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This whole share support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the modest increase for salaries, which are rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, it is the aim of the organizers of the protests to create them in their trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, this economic sector virtually untouched odborářským movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The 46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America struck an orgy of cheap sales in the millions, and in some cases has been accompanied by the brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some workers, Wal-Mart, which works worldwide to 2.2 million people to leave their workplace and demonstrating together with the trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational companies, retail chains, whose goods are addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Wal-Mart sells around the world everything from diapers to hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores are on average by 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and range of goods made from the chain Wal-Mart one of the largest companies in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the words of critics can afford to sell their goods as cheaply Wal-Mart partly because few pay their employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company have risen sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Wal-Mart worker receives 75 dollars per hour, but that does not match the height of spending, say officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If the company moves to increase wages Wal-fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only about 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year as customers will spend about $12, 39 more than today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Wal-Mart's defenders point out that the protest was held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" in stores the company lasted from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this period, the company sold about 5,000 Wal-Mart items of goods per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, the Treasury carried out in the "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A representative of the company Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post Web site that jobs out of a total of "less than five" Wal-Mart employees, and that the protest was nothing but "another media sensation," organized by trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Vacant Treasury."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York, where they were trading houses to Walmart (those in that pokrokovém town are not very popular, and therefore are almost here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says that sells billion servings per day, and then you paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York $7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average they receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in this expensive city, lower wages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Well, I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Employment in the "McDonald's" almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter part-time after school and live with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood, or plans to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">At present, I constantly in conversation with the workers, "McDonald," who complain that they must live on this money, and some of them even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal's comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at the "McDonald's" on the unusual Street and Madison Avenue, requested that the cashier and cooks in fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">It also demanded that the fast-food in the area were based trade unions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American laws prohibit the administration to prevent the establishment of trade unions and trade union activists to punish bullying and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other side of the administration rarely makes life easier.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the fast-food companies to establish trade unions, however, is difficult even for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The opposition</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In this day of noisy protests also were held in a number of other low-priced restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the action was in the noon rally at the "McDonald's" near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's," says that sells billions of portions, and then you paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators also have the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we have to act together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food sector.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, it is as yet unclear.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"So far, the brain to deceive the average"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Among the fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; lately, it means, in particular, to see the world through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a working model of this news, and in November it was announced that the application for the patent, as well as Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In an interview with the leader of a group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that this company glasses for scientists are already a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="5">The challenge is the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Tell us in general, what is your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mankind has been stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touches the screen with his finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility of proceeding with gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What is ahead of us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Notwithstanding that Kinect system carried the interaction on a physical level, a lot of interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">To improve the flow of information (the system) is a lot of data, but so far no output flow.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that, we are working on a three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to let the world into our physical world, to make it more realistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much better form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell with those silly helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think of the vocal control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a popular thing to do, but does not exaggerate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Of course it cannot be regarded as a panacea - there is the question of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not for long, only about such Tiffany, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gesture would nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is great, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">In general, however, the future is a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- A how?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- How, for example, you ask me to give you this can of soda?</seg>
<seg id="29">Say it, and at the same time you show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually just talking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- So, you want to get the user to adapt to what at the moment may or may not machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can accurately detect human reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser scanners, which provide a good in-depth resolution, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Today is not a sufficient distinction, depth, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In fact, the current generation - that's what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it's not just about the megapixels, but as a matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the current view of the case are all the current lack of technology for us - that's the trouble with algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">So we must bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y axes, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">So it is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how much it affects the human-computer interaction.</seg>
<seg id="47">For me, it would be very useful in the work of the equivalent of such a device, but I don't need as much light, but I need some extra frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In the Kinect system are now used three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and receiver, the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera - that is, in fact, a visible sensor zone.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">A greater number of cameras could potentially solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">Or worse, because it would increase the volume of the necessary calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curve of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presented publicly his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You don't think in terms of day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course to go and constantly keep smatphone in his raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest option would be "portable" version of the reality, which would be based on the platform of the switch whenever buiding glasses on the smartphone, the projection display and around.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (private things you only see you), and also on the basis of weakness - augmented reality glasses allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem, which critics often point: There is no tactile response.</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands don't feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What is your group's response to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the addition of the tactile qualities might have had one eighth breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a kind of background for the display.</seg>
<seg id="66">Is an excellent way to bring!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really focused on the addition of these "images of solidity in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beam in a defined point the finger, a tactile sense, but it's still very weak - as if you blew on his fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers - also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To think that's what it seems that he should feel at the moment, when they see something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- It is a good idea, that we haven't tried yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is yet another challenge that we will fight for a long time - how to get a man who is physically located in a very confined space, to believe that it is an open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and the huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, it is still work for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what he was doing work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in the very early stages.</seg>

<seg id="18">- At the exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky Prospekt Station, where they were exposed to my work.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understand what is my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then came a wave of unofficial artists old and new, free types of artists I couldn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="21">I made friends with the new wave of artists, with post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the "puškinské 10," and the next wave.</seg>

<seg id="25">There was much: Nome, tequila jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought to the project "Ears Van Gogh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Šnur under the plywood and his friends sang a song, they dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, midway between them, the composer Igor the dowager's, which is now in vogue.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To address the issue of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already half a century ago were carried out experiments on plants.</seg>

<seg id="14">It was then carried out the insects in orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We are absolutely normal output of the bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then begin the problems.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," said the head of the laboratory of the Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If they don't support, the birds chaotically fall and somersault.</seg>

<seg id="23">"Twice we left turn into birds, but then we rejected it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," commenting on the failure of an experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">After landing on the ground, the space rats born offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">The approach to the problem of reproduction in space, however, so far failed.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is a difficult task.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">The greatest danger was Tereshkova's.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most precious thing that mankind has is the female body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Chaika, and no one on Earth could not say whether the last flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether it can give birth to a child after such a flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I still have no answer to that question," says the veteran-space industry Vakhtang Vačnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, he was born the son of a second wife-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice, and who worked in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only a few cosmonauts, which after years of birth and grow the health of the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="48">"In addition, it can be dangerous even when the orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Yet humanity must inevitably find new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a stage of preparations for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in the conditions of zero gravity, the astronauts learn the skills needed to work in an open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water simulates the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Though the water is even comfortable for adults, but in a way, in a strange environment for small children is a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between the fact that the child is at an average of nine months in his mother's amniotic water, and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, after only two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It is very little to a child something forgotten," says Marina Aksenovová infant swimming instructor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness more natural state, then it is more natural for women inevitable gravity, an attractive force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In microgravity is very quickly to the wasting of abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreases the body's ability to expel the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">We can leave aside, if they work promoters of muscle activity in childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="61">After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the body of the mother, the fetus is expelled.</seg>
<seg id="62">"What next?" Asks Valeri Polyakov complex questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the baby also needs the artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">If there is no gravity on the body, cannot properly form the skeleton or muscle system.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn in orbit, it is not possible to dress as an adult in a suit with a burden, in which he could train.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">They will be deprived of what it needs to develop unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="67">"If you go to the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we bring a disabled person on Earth, which will be absolutely nepřizpůsobená our environment," says the Commission on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So that children born in the universe today is only a theoretical question.</seg>
<seg id="69">Once again, however, the time will come when it becomes a reality, when the issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of the owls: Check švarcsystému failed due to politicians</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has good in connection with public procurement supervisors and high-quality legislation, but is lagging in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we are missing, in my opinion," commenting on the current situation of Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Similar findings also suggests joint control of the Czech and German controllers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the wrong practice gives access to the so-called "Petr Nečas švarcsystému."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs to bother his checks - it is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law must be set up, and if you order, you can prevent even the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations," says Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech and German side, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel control, which we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply, the European legislation regulates how public procurement contracts, followed by the various national legislation and then also the practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We put all of this together, and even if the review is not yet completed, we have a very interesting differences - generally speaking, legislation is perhaps "stricter and more sophisticated," however, the practice is in some respects better in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still further and further, more precise rules, but it is necessary to deal with the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">What you can help this project, what it means for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is a joint control could contribute to efforts to stop the refining laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, though it does not have a positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Cost-effective means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (but this does not always mean the lowest price), to avoid the enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, by reducing the limit of the contracts that we don't necessarily achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maybe the system into a "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system, so they will draw much more easily than if the limit was higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You're talking about domestic problems in passing legislation on public procurement in practice.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar to the owls, or is it set up differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities, as well as the owls Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized like us, also has a college, but in a slightly different way, but in principle, the two offices are following.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The powers are similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a federal structure, so that the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - that the system is a little different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can control only the federal money, we posed by state resources.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds, which are managed by the county and municipalities, the control of the level of the federal courts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As regards the legislation, so that it is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I don't like it without specific data, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but I cannot say that it is in all the better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It is therefore necessary that they have better controllers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it has to be said that even countries that we consider to be a model, are faced with a wide range of problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, no?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With regard to domestic legislation, what was your office for amendments to the law on public procurement, there are already some of its effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the validity of this amendment is relatively short, so we not yet in control of events.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because we are ex-post controls, it is to be expected with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">So far, we have seen it only in the process of preparing future controls - we started our new instrument, the risk of detection "inefficiencies" through which we run almost 14 thousand public contracts, and we've analyzed it - there is, of course, those changes will be, because their limits, the conditions of certain types of competition, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The approval of this law, therefore, is more for the benefit, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem here may be that she "tighten the rules" and can not be respected.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the previous rules are controlled by the person committed (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In this way, the price of the law to tighten?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system shall exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And how it is out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us show you the way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs bother controls the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what does that mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Švarcsystém is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law must be set up somehow, and if you order, you can prevent even the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Can say: "We will change the law and allow it," but I can say that we're going to do anything like that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the law on public procurement are fairly strict rules about what is to be done formally - which is right, in order to protect the public.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is tragic, as the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we are missing in my opinion.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about the fact that in less than a month to be the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with his band The Tap Tap, make a joke and say that we are the only band in the world, which is able to gather enough positive energy to the end of the world delayed or prevented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December, there will be a unique project three concerts at the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you imagine him closer to readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a national fund-raiser, which we are planning for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21, at 11: 10 in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before the 20th of December from 21 hours will take place in parallel 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">End will be around at the time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone of 12 hours ahead of us, the end of the Maya calendar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally, it was probably my idea, then we were all together with our art director John Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, we want to amass the positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want the public to think about the condition of one of the world to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group The Tap Tap, together with other performers also sang the national anthem at the end of the world, which is called "The End of the world lifted."</seg>
<seg id="16">Today it is very popular on YouTube, will also be on these charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, in the very end, that is, if we can do everything and the end of the world does not.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sing it all the artists on all three concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The anthem is also a link in a unique live on Czech television.</seg>

<seg id="20">He wrote the words to the song, and the role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you get to work with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We are also working with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we have a lot of charity events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying to engage in these projects is hard.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the proceeds from the concerts to the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The equipment of an accessible training centre Studeo, which was the sixth year we s občanským sdružením Tap in Jedličkově Institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">The school's students are regularly Jedličkova teachers and pay them in activities that are fun and are interested in.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students do not have the means to go to the teachers themselves, so they are trying to make in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there will be a separate building in which we are with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert will be a few musical groups and artists.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what you choose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">You learn all the details on www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are you planning a similar "bombastic action" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we will for the first time to appear at the Prague Spring, so here we have an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I would like to integrate with a speech in Washington and in Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you speak, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London, or in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group of disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="40">How the way you logistically and organisationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five members in an electric cart, its trucks must travel in the baggage compartment, and, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, so far it's always handled without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways were well prepared for us, I wondered how many times before.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to výjezdům abroad you can compare how each differs in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you have not yet met?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we're in Russia have seen that in the East, everything is still in the complete beginning.</seg>
<seg id="48">Moscow to Prague is a barrier, it is still unusual for a man in an electric wheelchair he was in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is no such obvious, would you prefer to be wheelchair in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are civic associations, which seeks to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">On the contrary, and what we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to note that the improvement and the improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe learning self move in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, in that we have with The Tap Tap a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things really begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but a few years back what you made in 1998 to start it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to do.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am a musician, I play the saxophone, among other things, so I, along with my colleague founded the extracurricular musical circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But came to popularity in recent years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that helped us when we began to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.</seg>
<seg id="64">We realized that the work, which is not visible, in essence, as if there was.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was your goal to go to The Tap Tap so high?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt the potential of the fact that I can do something different.</seg>
<seg id="68">Showbusiness is crowded things, where one mimics the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">In a way, it is logical, everything new is taken carefully and it takes a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">The things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who can see us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it's only natural.</seg>
<seg id="72">But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with learning disabilities are not suffering from all the things that we have to regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are the people who can live a full life and develop, assuming, of course, that they have the means to do so.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if something can people with learning, so it is not only shift for them, but for society as a whole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">This success has helped, too, that you are a hard taskmaster, as many people as you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do a good job, we must be tough, and in many cases require some discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think it is perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that he must go to the test twice a week, be on the product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, it's enthusiasm quickly leaves.</seg>
<seg id="79">But the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the band The Tap Tap twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, people are leaving and coming, that can't be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and desire, the door is always open for</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">INCHEBA Kalfus will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava Flédě form with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the cosmos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at a meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency adopted Poland as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, like the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full-fledged member of the ESA, 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Poland's journey into space began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Flights into space is devoted to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, remind the lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, 6 December 1933 represented the thoughts of his pioneering work Entry into space.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (born 1905) left audiences cold and after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 he Šternfeld for Entry into space in France, the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Vzpomenutý doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), later became a promoter of astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomski is a world-known promoter of space and his contribution was recognized by one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named on his behalf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">He was in Poland in 1925 built rolling the car, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and there is no details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to take the trolley or its application.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about the handcar dobového are known only from the press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933, the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research was Komórka techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Professor Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some of the materials, it is clear that the research has reached a stage of prakzických tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the arrival of German troops was interrupted research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 he appeared in academic journals, a photovoltaic the interceptors designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year she work Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just before the war, all the projects of military use of rocket technology to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) to coordinate all the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of his work ended the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">The first is the mention of the company in the November edition of the year 1954 magazine issues in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, from Professor M. Subotowicze, is designed to create a society that will deal with space.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, running projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is a promising field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish company astronautická snažia (PTA) to join the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">This function held until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with dostupem 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and it weighs less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, it was built by an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 started in the two-stage missile flight tests Bledovské RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was four feet long and its weight was about 11,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">Further development of the type we should be able to real scientific work - the RM-34 should have the ceiling to 14.5 km and its mission was monitoring the height of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, in 1962, was suspended for further development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The heir to the RM-type rockets became a missile Meteor-1 taken from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was designed as a two-layer, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">There have been three types of (the Meteor-1A, -lb and -1C), different sizes of space for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">In a rocket Meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum altitude for all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Between 1965 and 1968 probíhal v Leteckém Institute development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were built version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Still, it is worth mentioning the entry of Poland into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland is also under the Intercosmos involved in research into space on a Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court to annul the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution provoked a lively debate on the public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect, this means that the various economic departments, national economic systems, is in permanent conflict between them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the principle of free trade and free movement of unrestrained private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the significant differences in the cost of labour (wages), the price of tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in the fact that "you" the price of a competitor in order to push for greater market share and thereby increase their profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate the production abroad, or buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared with other economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising social spending in the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation underscores the reluctance of businesses to pay taxes and to replace a national economic and social damage done in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that there is no need to give specific statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of its own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the government gave private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected in the amendments to existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim is to make its own population adopted the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is happening on the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and limiting the rights of employees in the field of employment law.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are already a number of years of public ticket of food for the poor who cannot feed their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that have been properly employed people receive a wage that must be paid to the breadline.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the scandal was published, and in the case of auxiliary staff of the federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures virtually all of the southern EU states quite clearly lead to the same situation, where people are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of the social level of forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or wither for starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that it will come into the country's private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But there is a need to ask where it comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it will be from other EU countries, then move poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and the media to claim that the state cannot participate in the capital on their own economy that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private equity stubbornly insists on the view that the state should not interfere with the intervention in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then we need to ask whether the private capital does not affect, now governed by the policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is a clear answer that, yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Evidence of the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation, as reflected in the field of corruption, providing reciprocal benefits law, which is practically everything reprehensible, but not criminal.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds awarded the drafting of laws by private companies, which are often in conjunction with industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All the power that does not come from the people as they say Western-style constitution, but financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is clear now that the liberal-oriented democracy is rapidly moving into the situation, as he describes in his book The Appiános Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "The state had long been in full decay and the authorities took over the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">For bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and with stones or swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any barriers and people went to vote with pre-sold the voice of the people... "" character of the neucházeli at all, so that once was as a result of this disruption was the state eight months without consuls "...." it is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only cure is in a bad situation, and that it is necessary to choose samovláda energetic man. "Appiános had thought of Pompeia, but he had become Caesar, who changed to take democracy for self-rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Conclusion As in antiquity, the current society is based on a preference for their own benefit regardless of the society's interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply the benefit of society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform more profound.</seg>
<seg id="43">The causality of the onset of fascist and communist regimes, we must therefore seek in the indiscriminate liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the current state of these systems can be in favour of the type of liberal democracy as a break with the expectations of the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Particularly disastrous is the fact that the elites in the future be completely ignore the possible loss of life, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition both at international and European level, the Interior of the Czech Republic, the government will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore the system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen the state capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the company for the benefit of the state.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Israel: The chaos.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"Nothing would come of the violence, nor can never" Sting in the song Fragile whose main line in the chorus, "let us not forget how we're fragile."</seg>
<seg id="3">"If my sons did not want war, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild Amschela in 1849</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a lot of reaction.</seg>
<seg id="5">One is for Israel, they argue its right to self-defense and the Palestinians belongs to the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated by the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel belongs to the role of a terrorist state.</seg>
<seg id="6">I don't want to wonder who is in periodically recurring waves of killing the culprit and the victim, after all, the people of Israel, including the self-governing territory, born in the current political situation and the violence experienced.</seg>
<seg id="7">My point is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, to whom, in particular, is already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every era, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personality, which completely autonomously governed by their actions, or whether someone was standing behind the throne, who directed the actions to advance vytýčenému goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is in the hands of a few individuals and zkoncentrováno that this concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be regarded as the head of the octopus (if there is someone above them, I don't know, but I do not exclude that) - Rothschieldové.</seg>
<seg id="14">Doesn't say much about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course,.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) has already bought in the 1990s of the 19th century to stop linking his name with the highly criminal acts, which stood in the background and always meant for them to consolidate power, increase of wealth, or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have major stakes in almost all central banks in the world and against countries which do not have shares in the central bank's lead or prepare the war (against attacks by Afghanistan, it was 7-5 after invading Iraq was the country after the overthrow of the Gaddafi's only four, but in the meantime, Russia is subject to the Central Bank of the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who tried to resist the family, died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln Rothschieldově refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America, during the civil war began to issue their own money (the government) and he was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered by 1963, Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their desire for a global power in the years 1859-1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars of a Freemason, the 33rd degree of initiation Albert Pike.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was to remove a large monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial estates in Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population at 0,5 - 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury, and do not consume too many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which a group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">But these solutions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, in order to avoid a crisis like the one created in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">So, after they managed to murder the heir to the imperial throne-U R Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, destroyed the Czarist Russia the Bolshevik Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for a war for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and subsequently led to the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria, Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">To facilitate the release of the Second World War left the bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation by the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, which created a presumption of radicalisation's impoverished masses, and then they had to do was to give the Germans a sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering leader and creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which had to play, and I played, the fifth column, sparking a fire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the nineteenth century Rothschieldové prompted the establishment of the Zionist movement, which sought to establish a branch of the Jewish state, not preferentially in the history of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">Already mentioned Balfourova Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks took place on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The outbreak of the Second World War, Hitler off the chain, which kept him at first international bankers, or everything that was made in the plan is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Officially, Israel was founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany 2.světovou off to war, the state of Israel was created by the outbreak of war in the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish nation, as in the other, the victims in the front line of fighting, together with the Arab or Muslim population in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only within the country, but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided between supporters and opponents of the people of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice begets injustice in an endless chain of violence, when it stood at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their desire for a global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There is a need to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, the international bankers had decided to give people a choice in the elections only their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, loyal to the international bankers, a politician who is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and in view of the above moving through the control of Iran, which is 20% of all the world's oil (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In the light of what is now the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will agree to a new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">A new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world where the rest of the human population is the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world where every newly born individuals chip implanted at birth, which will make it totally controlled entity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"And forcing all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be on the right hand or forehead brand to buy or sell, who is not identified in the name of the beast, or the number of its name.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is important to understand: Who has the sense to lists the numbers of the beast.</seg>
<seg id="44">This number indicates the man, and that number is six hundred and sixty-six. "</seg>

<seg id="1">The movie Argo: When it is the worst call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A crowd of demonstrators in November 1979 Islamic students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, the patron saint of his regime for several decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The situation for the US administration offered a positive way - to throw overboard the Shah couldn't afford, because it would fundamentally compromise the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The detention of the diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations brokered the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their plight has sparked a wave of solidarity at home and protiíránského sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck's Argo describes one episode in the history of America has brought a small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before the occupation of the embassy have fled from her six employees.</seg>
<seg id="12">The complex business ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, helped the extravagant a cover story - went to the Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country was the location for filming the sci-fi epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which was invented by an expert on "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, require the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">The legend was credible, it was a film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, a production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck film is a special combination of more genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "right movie," during a story, the caper - an example would be a series of Danny's teammates.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film, the mood turns - on the one hand, documentation or evidence on the concept of a sequence of Tehran (ikonické titulkové sequence are shown in photographs of events and the way they were in the same situation presented in the film - there are big differences in it).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there was the scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions -muži in suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the office, on the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleckovi is remarkably successful restart a career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vysmívaného actor became a respected director, and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film, after the Czech Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">It is also the first Affleck film, which is not taking place in režisérově home Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that warned older films place over the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">He and Affleck in Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scene in the movie is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování actual events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that ensue when they move somewhere out of history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect of Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes contrived (false staff at teheránském bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many times in too many places,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director also had to deal with the fact that told the story in the movie does not offer much in terms of exciting scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Quite successfully, it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - there's not all that smart (the scene in which the looming crisis will call on teheránském airport in America and chase down the runway is pretty far-fetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Argo's weakness but restlessness arising from the need to show too many times in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in roles Hollywood associates was very charming, but their characters would have more space and are not in the movie is far from the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleck film loses a bit of dramatic tension, it's a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to appreciate the retro style and evocative thrillers of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="37">But hard to take.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of a sort of living history as well as proof of how far-fetched the idea of allpowerful and vševědoucích secret services, but will suffice.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who each year publishes poll on the absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition for the "absurd regulations or ideas from the EU."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"This led us to this last event, when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the leadership of major European companies," said Patrick Nacher právo organizer survey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The nominees absurditami is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of the unification of premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">While the women were still in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are less risky for insurance companies objectively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Another incredible ideas from the EU can nominate people by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Among the controversial EU regulations are necessary and mandatory blending of biofuels into the fuel, which in turn is harmful to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or about the size of a hen s cages, which this year, significantly more expensive eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Also faced criticism before the de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or phase out incandescent bulbs from the sale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">High-quality bananas have 14 inches</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The camera is often under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a state or group of states (in the Czech Republic now and the threat of veto by the requirements of their banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby, as well as for the fact that, for example, have the highest quality bananas in the Union consists of at least 14 cm and could not have "abnormal curvature."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission, said that the only harmonises the uniform national standards that complicated business.</seg>
<seg id="14">Standards for fruit and vegetables have softened over the opposition of some EU states, pointing out that the existing Directive lead to food waste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for victory in the poll may be last year's EU regulation, which must be sold balloons in the mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU's appeal to the American research, in which the balloons are the leading cause of death among children's toys to suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction now applies to children up to 14 years in blowing into the funhouse frkaček.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Quaint ideas are born at home,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It is quite absurd and rule on the European officials - anyone who has an official role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece should instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire put forward in the polls, in addition to some of the above absurdities even EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks, which could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, the Czech Republic and then crossed the volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which was threatened with a large fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Organizers of the survey took the idea to pay for some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to the request for a grant.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas, however, not in Brussels, but in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We're handicapováni that we don't have the sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will ask the European Union for reimbursement, "he said in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As the argument that so many of us in the grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Czech Republic has continued to ports, we had to pay the EU Palase hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The European Commission finally came out of the Czech Republic to the fact that a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Grant to obtain subsidies offered by municipalities, the Ministry for Regional Development Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, should go to write applications for subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the regulation in the Member States could easily become a target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time, a more efficient operation and development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A more serious problem, according to experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies to projects that do not have even a hint of anything to do with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations forced the Member States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Emotions among the Czechs is that, like other countries of the Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to the specific indications of its traditional products, and not always succeed in this game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czechs had a six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians strike of the Olomouc cheese, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, for us, our producers have renamed tuzemák.</seg>
<seg id="36">The rum can carry only products made from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the EU's official list of registered products in the company of world-renowned feta cheese, Gorgonzola, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, for example, were already Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr and Žatecký chmel.</seg>
<seg id="38">The EU's trade mark can also boast of the Pardubice gingerbread and hořické tube.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">I don't care about it, to be a senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If it worked in our country without any problems, so nekandiduji anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can't watch the last twenty years the country rozkrádá, as the thieves running, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambition to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something I don't like it, so I'm trying to come up with a solution to change that.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I was 40, and I'm an independent nestraník, I have no choice, how things affect than to run for senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You got to the Senate, but then you went to the Castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The whole time I was saying that I'm going to fight for the Castle to the outcome of the congressional elections.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is not my intention to function, function is a tool, how can I carry out his vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, I have the greatest influence and what the strongest mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not just that, as a nation at in the pub and in front of the TV, but that trampling on anyone who wants to try to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">Add to that the media that a man dehonestují and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">For me, to be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's go to your vision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to fight for the Championship started with the thesis material and criminal responsibility of politicians and rear-view property returns over 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">This you have to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">But you don't have such power as president and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as a citizen lobbying to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is politics, when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, is rejected, and that the citizens lives.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nestraník I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My preference is that without the partisan categorization and dogmas I can take what is best for our country, from every side, and to apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you consider yourself more as a right-wing or left-wing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it is not important, if a little to the left or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important for us to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always I will support any public good solution, even though it will propose the Communist Party, or ODS, and so I'm going against a bad idea.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament, you would have just passwords.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that, in the long-term nevystačíte.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that if you for people to walk and talk with them, that you can get, for example, criminal and material responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I don't have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on your side to enforce it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected president, is not a problem to hold televised live, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they would eventually have to say why they did not want it.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong personality, which will tell abuses can push on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="47">Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I'm not a genius, or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">For his views and visions of trying to find allies.</seg>
<seg id="49">In politics, I have only just begun, and for your program I try to get majority support.</seg>
<seg id="50">The things I'm trying to push myself, if it doesn't work, for six years I finish and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It sounds a bit like Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that in one person to do nothing, so I walked around a number of well-known people, as well as candidates for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to Radimem Jančurou, that because of the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">So I at least support the investigative journalist John Lorencovou that rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in the balance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who followed, most of the elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we are only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People navolili Senate so that it will be difficult to enforce the changes.</seg>
<seg id="60">Still, I'm going to fight for your vision, such as the direct election of mayors or generals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Are you considering establishing their own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I hadn't even thought about it, because I don't have time to check the history of each potential Party man, and I don't have the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You don't have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You're talking about financial returns, what is yours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The private property I estimate about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I land about 25 million, an apartment in ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3,5 million and Skoda Superb in a million, and then I have a couple of million in the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, he was courteous to women, and at the same time, he fought against the wrongs and excesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do you drive an Aston Martin, you have the property for 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say you want to change the Republic, but much of their own money to give you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">To get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I bumped into the campaign for 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that on my program might not be so interested.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I don't have an obligation to pay from his campaign.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign, in fact I will cover what I receive senátorský salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I nevyžil from him, for example, I couldn't pay my son English school, which costs 30 grand a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to make money, so nekandiduji anywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So, you will continue to do so you can live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Didn't you say that these activities utlumíte?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But that has nothing to do with the amount of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, I'm part of their activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, a manager of the travel agency in the spring will be my representative.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like to be the Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need something to live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much are you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures are only in my head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"The building seems to me to be cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig that goes around the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the large enterprise, says: "Of course, the house is nice."</seg>
<seg id="4">However, I wonder what today we need the library.</seg>
<seg id="5">They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">In any of these libraries in the old-style today, nobody goes voluntarily, do you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, is holding a special record.</seg>
<seg id="8">This town of 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To resolve this silly situation, the decision was made a few years ago to contribute to the general education and build seven nicely painted miniatures of fictitious reinforced concrete bridges, which are prominently displayed on the euro banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive but was less than glowing.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so the city's officials knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: We need to have a library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas of MVRDV Rotterdam architectural studio, the insanely courageous column graphs and the contractor of humorous, often even cynical buildings, took issue with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003, with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the commission is still looking around in amazement and shrugged her shoulders, piling fresh Maas on their gifts, according to the size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear urban community."</seg>
<seg id="14">So this is my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million euros stacked.</seg>
<seg id="16">Revitalizačního is part of the project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, a mountain of books will be honored the second place "Best Library of NL 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Small-town gray, which still could not offer more than post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly town hall, for which you would expect more whiteface dairy is richer thanks to a contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But above all, is now the first public cultural construction of Spijkenisse in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A long way to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: Reading the Eldorado under the hatch on cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">The center of the mountain while riding the elevator, but the real space and reading passions arrive on foot to control the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">From all sides with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant street lamps clearly reflect the atmosphere of the public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You can see a park bench, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.</seg>
<seg id="27">And all the books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally there are shelves of books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We built a spatial configuration upside down and space for the reader, we went up from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the mountain of books is skillfully exploited: In the middle of the office, the library, chess club, eco-centre and the operator of the technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Special comfort are black bookshelves, which are once again lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">The appearance, structure and the smell of the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Over the unknown building material shaking their heads and even the bitterest architects and engineers.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager in the municipality of Spijkenisse, on the question of the Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a base under the roots-millimeter fleece of synthetic material.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and time-efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thin textiles will last one or two seasons, and then it is ready to blow up into the bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library was fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - pressed down on the boards of a thickness of four inches.</seg>
<seg id="40">The effects of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Commission on Human Rights) in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that smells like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After the 105 steps you get to the top.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of a nearly 500-foot-long journey will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus plants in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly about the humidity in the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Gifts for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I guess you wouldn't believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass areas a project, in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Vytápí and cooling the warmth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in sunny days.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad glued wooden beams, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as a shield and pick up a large part of the solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very nice.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of you will fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited a new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: Everyone in the city a few weeks ago, he was invited to the opening to take a book from his personal funds.</seg>
<seg id="55">It should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped library, which currently stands at 70 000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has been.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are filled with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our invitation now has a new home all residents of a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it was just for show.</seg>
<seg id="62">This is MVRDV worked in the discipline, which, in the jargon says the formation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse said the history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">No matter how young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">Finally, it is the starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the decision-making on the adoption of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa Berlin poised on the narrow edge of diplomacy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week, first suggested that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained from the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why? "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, it must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel prudent.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I think it will not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - without, of course, was too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ultimately put NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of the policy, which was to run by the US, in the direction of German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are between the two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think of it in its role of settling down, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">On foreign policy, as they are in France or in Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows a readiness to take in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other major powers, Germany and therefore must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Should the economic interests of the effect on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, they must be careful not to discourage the public, but the elites in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">It certainly plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't want to do but not to give too much of it, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">In any case, however, it plays an important role in the German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Damage Germany's relations with the US, Germany, in the case of the two important decisions abstained in the vote on Palestine, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think in Europe and even in the US there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I don't think it was such a dramatic break as in the issue of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="34">Germany, perhaps even get some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">In contrast, the US is clearly called for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are between the US and many European nations differences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">These differences existed as a result of American domestic politics always.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But as a result of the political situation, of course, cannot take this position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think the difference of opinion is not as great as they always seem to.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama isn't too thrilled Netanjahuovou policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US position on the one hand, and with the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the Germans, of course, would have been a little easier if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is just what they are doing with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">It has always been a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself as a major international player? Wants to take over the main role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is it a leading role for Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still not used to it, it's still uncomfortable, and for the country, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany takes a greater role, creating the post of mood.</seg>
<seg id="57">That the Germans, not easier.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is actually an old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be acceptable to the various neighbours and views, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The influence of the US in European politics now continues to decline, however, the EU is currently not filled that vacuum. Who else is there?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they don't like it, it makes them feel uncomfortable, and it makes them even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"The protection of brands" in China: When are Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a label that is completely officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, enjoys protection as long as the real owners nezažalují brand.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then, it is not clear whether the law over.</seg>
<seg id="7">"For foreigners, it is increasingly difficult to protect its brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of the protection of rights in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week, he lands on my desk a new case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In addition, counterfeiters have had a few letters, so that they can make their mark.</seg>
<seg id="10">From Gucci, for example, will be Lu-Gucci and Prada have register instead of Prada-Kyus.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, they are legally copied and German companies, sporting-goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens the folder the records of the Trademark Office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">14 September 2010, left one Chinese company to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma. The name parazituje and fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in the copying and violations of intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="15">In large cities are multistory malls, which are almost exclusively sell fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">But other cases are Pattlochovy. On behalf of their clients is opposed to Chinese firms received from the Trademark Office, the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," Associated brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word focuses on the "Bang Dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">This meant women who hunt the rich man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is damaging to business, we have to fight," invites Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Mark is diluted, exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is huge."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive demonstration products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company's market research for CLSA China is a $15 billion a year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="25">The deletion of dubious records in the register of brands may be difficult to achieve, however, and that's worth something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected the claim, because the name was contested after a long duration of the "market reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff has the misfortune of plagiátorovi must still pay for the damage to its brand in China, Pattloch says.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, he lost a legal dispute with Daimler, the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, the company, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps on the concrete mixture.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.</seg>
<seg id="34">The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although the CTMO 2.3 grade point admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of staff and space.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year, allegedly "the work of the emergency situation back to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, the number of unprocessed proceedings on objections fell by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was one of the 57 000 of these cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To do something against it is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As is often the case in China, it is an impressive numbers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year it was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the brand, which is nearly a third more than the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's a record, and it means that China is the tenth in the list of new applications in the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">This also applies to the number of all existing trade marks - there are a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="47">It simply means that on average, each logon is 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Start against the dispute is several times, as shown in the case of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">This group for more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans had achieved that was cancelled his illegal manufacture imitovaných car parts.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the forger had secured the rights to the mark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">We would be able to retrieve it, because the name in Germany cannot be protected, "says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The 2.3 grade point CTMO then also rejected the Munich firm.</seg>
<seg id="54">In two other instances, Freudenberg its rights, but the defendant in the case is still further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It should be just as careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end, and commends the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs cannot be measured in the archives of the company had to even look at a hundred years old writings to produce evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago the company Freudenberg counterparty in vain offered "a high six-figure sum in euros" in order to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="61">"You can see what it means to us," said Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">There is a risk that the danger from the Far East and Europe will.</seg>
<seg id="63">And that's when there are unprotected brand imitators.</seg>
<seg id="64">For example, one Chinese producer, wanted to make the Freudenberg in Germany for footwear and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of the business, the group gave up a long time ago, but was able to avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"We need to be very careful," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He and the lawyer Pattloch advises German companies to be very cautious in dealing with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international law známková. Foreigners would rather have "anything that in any way is worth protecting, log on in China," said Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it may be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama to the mark, then I will have to pay royalties for the opposing party's own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we will be pushed in the contested segment of the market.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">The facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Which are the most serious sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial SPI belong to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral SPI, HIV, the human papillomaviruses, herpes glandis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crabs and scabies is the parasite SPI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who belongs to the group of the most affected?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis were reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV is spread among adults heterosexuálními us relatively little, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">The chlamydiové infection among adolescents are significantly more often than in other groups of the population.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, the human papillomaviruses among adolescents often occur.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As the number of infections has evolved?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all of the sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled at 3698 disease in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of people newly infected with HIV, since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">The year 2011 was about 700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is about one-tenth of less than a year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms point to sexual disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen and blisters or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore nezpozorovány.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How is it possible to protect?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, however, do not offer 100 percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases and infections can be transmitted from impurities and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">In the case of early diagnosis is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent the long-term consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least honorářům, which earns a chorus singing throughout Germany, to collect some money.</seg>
<seg id="62">"We have to send a total of about 200 000 euros Esitjeni," says the President Annette Lennartz.</seg>
<seg id="63">The money from Germany is in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who can impose.</seg>
<seg id="64">Also takes care of orphaned children found shelter, for example, one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogo, as in the language of the Zulu says old women are the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have even 14 orphans, give them shelter and care for children in every day to school on time in uniform.</seg>
<seg id="67">Children who already have one, they go to the shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman is society as well as two cooks, daily cooks for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">"Play for Africa" and established a school sewing, built two chicken houses and, together with the American Health Organisation PSI so that many people in the village had HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is not granted. Although the disease in the country so obvious, everyone is silent about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king's 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">In fact, rather strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his expected lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">The state-approved way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">But even many migrant workers who took the virus across the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is being used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">At least a little to promote cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi once every two or three years together in South Africa and singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and the self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent is known from the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - such valuation is not only the mood and joy, but also has already sparked tears for many of the wild border troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children, over which they have patronage.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even though this village hardly can be found on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than familiar.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," they say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is miles away as the crow flies 8733, dupajícím singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Our eyes into space: The most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks that broker, are still deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">It was the largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror in this picture had an average of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In the US, the Large Binocular Telescope is.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is enormous. Just a mirror measured an average of 10,4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to-costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Still, his average is about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of cheap way of construction: The telescope is secured hákovadlem angle in the high-rise, which limited his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">In the high-rise angle is fixed and the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="62">His specialty is the high increase in luminous flux.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is despite the relatively small diameter mirror is the largest mirror dalekohledům in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) in the universe, scientists are searching for extraterrestrial signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">This radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help every owner of a computer, which can be available to its computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the post of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is the Very Large Telescope - and a credit to her name.</seg>
<seg id="69">The telescope, with a total of four mirrors can shine a light through the mid-infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The Very Large Telescope is planned for the Chilean Observatory ESO.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror is to have a full 42 feet and is to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">The images can be counted as soon as possible but in 2018.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Two Keckovy telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii in 2007 were considered to be the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">Keckovy telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which in addition to those views into space and using the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on Mauna Kea has created a new giant telescope - with a hundred-foot diameter mirror.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here you can admire it in the picture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important impressions of the universe provides us Hubbleův Space Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">The images of distant worlds gives us from 24 April 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Kepler space telescope is searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially for those that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of the mission was found 1235 candidate planets.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the picture are documented the final preparations before the Kepler space telescope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be the first in 2018 fired into space aboard rockets Ariane5.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6,5 meter.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The scientists are based on the fact that the ice at the South Pole of Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="87">For this, however, there are no reliable data, because the Messenger circling the planet is much closer to the North Pole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The radar measurements showed for several decades to ice on Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Egyptian president has pathos.</seg>
<seg id="6">We need to create a transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And for that we can do that, I'm responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was addressed to the entire nation, especially the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular parties.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">They all still hopelessly confused bickering within the opposition, they are scared.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fear of "God's country" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>

<seg id="14">234 sections which stohlavé Constituent Assembly dominated by Islamists patnáctihodinovém hastily approved in the marathon, partly to raise concern.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, even in this proposal that the jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what does "principles"?</seg>
<seg id="17">It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the vague wording of the Islamists and their associated legal free space to use for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least it sheds light on the newly added section: In all matters relating to the Sharia, you should consult with the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a big influence on the whole Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may not, but it may mean that klérus will exercise control over the legislation, which would bring the effective withdrawal of justice.</seg>

<seg id="24">Standing in the proposal, it should also stand to protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and support her morals and values."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">It is legally worded so loosely that it could use this section of the state institutions even control the content of the film art and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">In plain language, it does not mean anything other than censorship.</seg>

<seg id="27">Indeed, there is no point in writing does not define an explicit equality between men and women.</seg>

<seg id="30">Equally dubious is the wording that it is prohibited from "insulting people."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">In this case, it is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of experts law?</seg>
<seg id="32">A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which was submitted for signature Mursí and his words will be "very soon" to present them to the popular vote.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Norwegian rakfisk: Most of fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million people living in Norway, is one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">It might be the secret of the success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a couple of overripe cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put them in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let it a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So you can smell the stench of paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is snow, a beautiful view - and the smell in the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in the water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want to fish stank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">How is it, and it's getting cold, starting with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet on the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, nejpodmanivějšímu food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You eat it raw and then it shall zapijete glass," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General," which is responsible for the course of the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people are eating small cubes of fish with a large quantities of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Some people have rather than the rakfisk aquavit," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Beverage can smell of the match.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few pieces of try.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, which was on a long journey by bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when she was in Norway poverty, and because there was no fridge, the fish in the fall as they arced away into airtight barrels of water and salt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and eaten - no doubt dulled the senses with alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, while the majority have emigrated to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of the immigrants are attracting a large amount of work, high wages and an extensive system of care.</seg>
<seg id="22">The people of Sweden, an old rival, which not long ago was much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, even though a smelly part of the past.</seg>
<seg id="24">Are among the more expensive dishes on the market.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come to 9 pounds ($14) apiece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is the global reports often lack - and it seems that most people like it that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The name of Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still refer to with distaste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, the shooting is called "event of July 22."</seg>
<seg id="29">The Norwegians may find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the beginning of the 1970s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," he says of the plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and startling blue eyes is a prototype of the Nordic welfare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as you say, thoughtful people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English, as well as the English of the majority of the people here, it is absolutely fine.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nepředvádíme, we don't like the pomp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of the industry's most of the money invested in a special fund for future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash threw money, which they had, the Norwegians were on their purse strings tight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And eating rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I've had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">An elk burger is certainly something else, and it's pretty juicy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening is a smelly fish here again.</seg>
<seg id="42">Hotel in which I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk served for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most demanding fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have a link to the live television coverage of the moderator with a bow tie is surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's like a singing contest at Eurovision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What do you score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"This is our scoring, Håvard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">With the applause and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls from a chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a start</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the city and causing chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The goal, however, did not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but to prevent the protesters in access to Parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Facing a daunting task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico, at the time of the term of outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, but the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has taken an estimated 60,000 lives in the past six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction of violence," the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he shook hands with the US president, the president of Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are different views on the new leader, and in his old homeland, populous and vast state surrounding the capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember him in a good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">He attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now you can go to the city for one of the new motorways, which let Pena Nieto to build these highways are a huge improvement from leaky and rugged roads that have been previously.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the Member of Parliament for the party of President Pena Nieta, the institutionalised Revolution (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, we hope in an interesting and real change in the field of security and economy that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After continuous 81 years in power, the PRI party, ousted Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Member of the Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos from within the party for Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">And refuses to express opposition to the new president as a man without a significant content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It's a very straightforward man, very impressed with an excellent vision of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that has many of his former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad she cannot be contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Tucked under the traffic overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the Autonomous Community, are also persistent and urban.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year, the army was called in to help with managing the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Only in the last two years were in wild places beside the huge waste dumps littered the bodies of dozens of murdered women.</seg>
<seg id="31">At a time when he was governor Pena Nieto, was murdered in the State of Mexico, more than 1,000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the best case, Pena Nieta critics say that during his term in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">And, in the worst case, accusing its leadership of closing one's eyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In the concrete house, typical for a run-down neighborhood, Buendia Irinea shows me pictures of his deceased daughter Mariana Islands Luna and crying.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of the Marian committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her family, however, believes that she was murdered by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived at her house, so it looked as if her body had been washed," says Ms Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs of blows and had begun to rigor mortis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">It tells the story of how her mother, Marian looking down from a picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which is a single word: "Justice."</seg>
<seg id="40">However, this is, as he says family, exactly what they have been denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Public authorities will treat me as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want you to just accept what they say, and silent.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But that can't be right, when there have been so many errors and omissions," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Sherpa, president of Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last six years, tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico and the new president promised during his term in office will be his priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that the president will be the same as the governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI Olvera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad she fears the most.</seg>

<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis of</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexicans have a tendency to blame those who left; they remind them of hard times, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I was hardly his way through the crowd, and I came into the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Arrow pointing to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and all my life I was called "Mexican."</seg>
<seg id="9">It's ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves as "Italy."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, I ended up in the "Mexican American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use abbreviations.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, I don't have the vocabulary of native speakers, and I can't get rid of an American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for the "Extranjeros."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I was thinking about the moment this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were the issues that are coming around, when the leaders of the two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why is the same probability that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to join with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto has promised that it will continue in Mexico's war against drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relationship with the United States, complicated and full of hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of arms over half of Mexico's territory to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So a minute after the representative of the United States to say anything remotely critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children Montezumy start on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, the real challenge for Mexico's relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about the hostile feelings?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers possibilities, and others who don't.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And more often than would seem to fit the profile of the person - dark skin, poor education, the origin of the poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not to Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And even though we are now living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.</seg>
<seg id="37">Is to the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">And we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">This feeling is mutual.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families in Mexico have failed, so it never left him.</seg>
<seg id="44">And we have now found no trapped behind the silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but even so, the lost souls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood had come to the United States legally, reminds me of that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is a tension, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican-Americans resent it.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know, is not a part of either.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in one.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, for us as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">And to complicate relations, they want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, combined with the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want Mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as a "makeshift ambassadors" and represented the Mexican interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should say to the American people how wonderful it is to visit the country, and the pressure on political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Well.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many of the hostile feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And thanks to the income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">It is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how they acted with Mexico before one and a half century ago, must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still feel indignation for the manner in which it was dealt with their family members in much closer to the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we are more "Mexicans" than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles, a new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain the basis for peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such activity is in vain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, it was changed many of the buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and the first time rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But even when it seems that the Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring changed the old ways and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe it means that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their deadly stalemate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war, which is neither won nor lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, it seems that at present, there is not much reason for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, the fight this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most pitiful and most populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well conclude that time is on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has powerful and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, revived regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, have been added to the side of Hamas, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering people from Hamas say the Islamic crescent moon circles around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where there is a party / militia Hezbollah through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly drawn to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, above all, on the southern flank of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, not to Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomacy with Hamas may emerge as a player who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has its price, and many of the Hamas rockets had been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, America is as hard as always, many European countries also blaming Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">And above all - Israel to prosper, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even if the rockets from Gaza since 2004, killing about 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which extends into the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are still growing, despite its illegality in international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign for the elections held on 22 January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If a rule in the West Bank, neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if we stay behind that wall and hit them when it was the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will win, but the Arab spring may change their calculations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even though the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, have little love for Israel, their first priority will be to deal with domestic problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Israeli defense spending is higher than the cost of all its four Arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">The opening of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that the president Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, is a good sign, and may be the start of something new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also, the Israelis would have to look at the situation in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates the denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination, a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel, as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">At present, the repression of the democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.</seg>
<seg id="43">The bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need incentives from the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is what they say reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: Two states, Israel referred to the territory because of security.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must work to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Arabs from outside must also push for agreement between Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state was more than an immediate offer of a virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.</seg>
<seg id="51">In his first term he ignored the show of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, back in the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is woefully short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="54">America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia, entered into force laws on the ugly cigarette packaging</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Green on the backs of the boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted a warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Australian laws on bad packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors of the brands were replaced by general olive green boxes with ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body and the depiction of children and newborns onemocnělých smoking as a result of their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are required from Saturday the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the same small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.</seg>
<seg id="7">He relies on studies that show that if people start smoking at the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that they will never smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Even in very young children, you can see that he understood the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell, together with their product," says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek and cites studies that have shown, for example, that children connect the crown in the logo with the idea to be a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase the trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more abundant.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia bring a lot more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Another says that the laws have increased their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette packaging of silicone used to mask the nasty boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal on the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ha said that the company has sold almost 6 000 Zico wholesale dealers and expects the new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is a good deal for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As a possible hitch experts cite the popularity of social media in the demographic groups to which the plan focuses.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that most vendors hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you are a marketing executive in the tobacco industry, and you have only this small space for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space insurmountable place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mrs Freeman has seen an increase in the evaluation of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average John."</seg>
<seg id="23">We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and put the work and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focused on how to deal with the new rules, rather than on marketing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the country within the World Trade Organization declared that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision of the PPW is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Minister Plibersek says that the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country to introduce a mandatory in 2001 warning pictures.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The stricter laws are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia is resisting.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pictures have no effect on me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just ignore it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Don't you pull out a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of the tumor in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, there is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little girl.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I won't lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come with praise nudění.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that for us (and our children) is a good, sometimes bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And given that most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have a chance to get bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We should support the boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And not.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I'll be back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, has a long history of boredom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, dating from the first century AD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After seeing the research literature and demonstration of the ideas to an audience of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience, "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom is different from apathy that the person is not involved in anything, but I would like to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that there is no need to do something for the apathy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says that at the heart of boredom is "disruption of the process of attention, joined in a bad mood and a sense of slowly pass ­ ing time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can be a lot of depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a relationship, when people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem within ourselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think we are bored, when we only have trouble concentrating.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, in which a person read an article in the magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so low that it barely noticed, while the third group didn't hear it at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who heard a television program, reported more boredom than the other two groups - have had trouble with concentration, but they weren't sure why, and attributed the problem of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When you're trying to concentrate on the difficult and exciting task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "such as the search for the bad parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you to get bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he said, we now know that the twisting and drawing, which are often viewed as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research shows that children who are allowed to move around, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We've all experienced - sometimes the boredom of my flight delays, the loud speaker, particularly lengthy film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some individuals have a greater chance to be bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">For help with the measurement of boredom in the 1980s, scientists have developed a "Living for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The scale includes questions such as: "Many of the things that I have to do is repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do it all."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using these scales, scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day, contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of adolescents indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents reported that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson said he didn't know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.</seg>
<seg id="44">He said, however, that he knows that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: "Boring is good for you?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo ridiculous physical risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to relieve it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not always the best thing you should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you're bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cooking, you'll be happy to do that.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you watch television, do you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you won't be bored, but learn how to entertain themselves or self-drive, said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And "this separate procedure is transmitted from one situation to the other," said the professor.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child will learn only how to entertain themselves, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think we really want to celebrate the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">But we should not be too critical of her.</seg>
<seg id="57">Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of range of the business and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We are accusing it of being bored needs even more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="60">What people are looking for, in fact, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the free time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is difficult to find ways to keep the noise down."</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado, there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and a football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be in its state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Orozco said that one September day he went with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a police officer found marijuana in the car, it was Mr Orozco issued summons for possession of drugs and paraphernalia for drug use and petty crimes for which the penalty is $100 for each - and set the date of the court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"They treated us like criminals," said Mr Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after Colorado vote on legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use of hundreds of smaller drug cases, the answer depends on the spot, rather than on the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police department to stop blaming adults aged 21 years and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the more conservative districts in Colorado have said that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, a number of cities from the Denver suburbs toward the western mountains votes on preventing the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The head of the gossip and regulators in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="14">And are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for the cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use, and now recreation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, as Mr Smith admitted no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no real precedent, according to which we can manage," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, the so-called I-502, shall take effect on December 6, which also left the annual vacuum in which there will be no more state licensing system, but legal possession of it.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are complex mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the state's directive on the "appropriate access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"There will be more difficult to locate a licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan areas of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, the recently-based research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">21 November sent from the city of Aurora police chief Oates of his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will no longer prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that the police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws regulating medical marijuana growers, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In northern Colorado in the Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck is a stricter.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, 119 people, even though many of them are facing additional charges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses, which was crimes at the time they occurred," Mr Buck said in his statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the joint initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, already adults blame for possession of small quantities.</seg>
<seg id="30">The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all the ongoing cases of possession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I don't think I'm losing my time continuing in law enforcement, until the change," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the conflicting reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It is for the district prosecutors' cultural barrier, "said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of laws relating to marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They spent so much of his life chasing people that still can't really accept that it is legal," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states to a small quantity of marijuana, they like to alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates and government authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and at the same time also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan as the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates the legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice complies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and those who use it to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">While protidrogoví agents probably will not break down the door to pick up a small bag of the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing the state-regulated business with recreational marijuana permitted by the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drug policy, the administration of President Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several Colorado cities waiting for the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before they will be able to open any business.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, the town of Montrose in the west of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone's license, and then we will have a federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are looking at what they voted for the municipality, contrary to what the state voted.</seg>
<seg id="47">There is really a lot of questions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford, because I'm a conservative."</seg>
<seg id="2">Their views are not only being attacked by today's college students.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't remember that I ever dreamed of studying at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">As my father and my elder brother had studied at the university, which I think is the world's largest seat of learning, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And while I am at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed her bags and dashed into the first scandal of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke down and wept.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I objected to the love of students in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from a chipped mugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth was less comical.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was being harassed for one reason, and in this cradle of alleged enlightenment that was as bigoted and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I a supporter of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You may ask, why this up until now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of center is suffering similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought the protection of equal rights to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the Association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, says that because of his political views are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and they made clear that they were not welcome."</seg>
<seg id="19">Ask for a position in the university's Committee on equal opportunities, to ensure that their views are free to communicate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation, or more recently the documentary for BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Stories of the country: Young, intelligent and right-wing) on the student politics, which conservatives have described as odd and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">The show was presented in a graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA, Oxford University Conservative Association), who drove a Rolls-Royce, he was dressed in a silver suit and silver head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Conservative students at other universities say that he is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees are treated as a "scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="23">Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association (the Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.</seg>
<seg id="24">People think that we as the Bullingdon Club, without meeting with us at all. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">A 20-year student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is "bad," while 19-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the JCR members access to the people on the right from the center of the worsening.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">During his first few weeks in Oxford, I was a member of a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">I started in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hatred of the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.</seg>
<seg id="30">A year earlier the university voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree of the former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">From the atmosphere, and the Stalinists trembled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">During the first few days in the opening week, when the new students meet among themselves and with the professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which was to come.</seg>
<seg id="33">I found that not only are professors in silence with conservative students, but also to participate in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In the paneled classroom was policy mining strikes, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="35">My first lecture was the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and for what happened, I wasn't ready.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "the first paragraph, please."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was pretty stiff.</seg>
<seg id="38">Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a dessert dough, was very bilious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" He asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students snickered.</seg>
<seg id="41">The tears in my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you do in your spare time she took some basic lessons in French, so if you're too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Heartbroken, I returned to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the dinner I sat alone at school, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a sophomore named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said gently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is the target.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the conservative freshmen pretending they are labouristi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend to be cowardly.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick has proved unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of fascist pig."</seg>
<seg id="55">You are infected.</seg>
<seg id="56">The other students notovali with him.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was sick, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How the Conservatives love?" Asked one.</seg>
<seg id="59">Hitting each other, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt as they feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">Sometimes I could lead a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">I would have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years in front of me to develop as a purgatory to ignore and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">He was the only openly conservative professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was in my school.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">Almost wasn't there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place for its parochialism and small-mindedness and for his shift to the Marxist-deterministickému view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he joined the place of Professor at the University of Bilkentské in Turkish Ankara.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You won't be happy here," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to commute from Oxford to her parents' house in London, seeking refuge in their non-partisan metropolitan friends and family.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that Oxford I hate and why.</seg>
<seg id="73">He couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, were accepted by all the political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.</seg>
<seg id="76">They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamlike mood.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends were always perfect ways.</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes became troubled.</seg>
<seg id="79">Try it again.</seg>
<seg id="80">I'm sure that this is just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart if you left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted from the frequent trips to London with my emotional resilience.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The following week, in the course of instruction, when the next history professor in utter seriousness said, "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Even when I was inside flushed with shame, I confessed to my parents "brainwashed" and I called them "old fogies."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Was only short-term relief.</seg>
<seg id="87">The nail in the coffin of my career, my father hammered.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time, he wrote two columns each week in the Murdochs "newspaper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I was inside, and after five minutes that my pursuers gave up.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never came back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me usmrkaným wimp.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no 18letá girl or boy in education should not be subject to such intimidation and rancor.</seg>
<seg id="95">Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, which not only came 14 conservative prime ministers, but to date, which is also behind the undeserved reputation with equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest job in the world: The Kawah Ijen volcano sulphur in the area</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The four euro gamble in the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, as are 70 kilos of sulphur down the steep stone paths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who actually work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners, who make their living from Kawah Ijen volcano sulphur extraction in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of this, every day fárat to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escaping from the interior of the Earth and in contact with the air passes into a solid state.</seg>
<seg id="6">After all the large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carries on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along the steep stone paths.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it is a mere 250 meters, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes before they get the tortoiselike pace up because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected his steps to nezřítili neuklouzli and into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as happened one French turistce, which collapsed years ago from the rocks Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which earns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">When they are at the top, making her way past the tourists who took them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, and tired of carrying the heavy weight of the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which benefit in the volcano since 1960 and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this product has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As it is commonly worn by 70 pounds, earn about 46 000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each trip," explains us Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.</seg>
<seg id="14">One way it takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but so can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even though it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what it earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The miners' daily wage here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," says Porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for good reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulphur: "I'm married with a young girl from Bali, which is Hindu, and I took her to Java, converted to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years of Anto three times daily risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur, it has already begun to take their toll, even though her face is protected by a special mask and goggles.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases escape from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price he must pay for it to achieve his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work for two more years, because I want to open a business or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This charming and intelligent young man in fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or the reception in a hotel, and instead of doing the work of the media.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers and every day she gets up at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur in the night and continues to build up its distinctive yellow color changes in the dark blue and September.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto sheds light on his way into the crater and a small lamp, which is mounted on his helmet, and he bought it for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 media are on the shoulders of the sulfur from the bottom of the crater</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Although the company has a high income, the extraction of sulphur nezmechanizovala because of cost savings, or provide porters working on their own and with such vigor, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, and do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) from a surcharge on photography, which, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) to collect the natural park from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year old porter who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left the school.</seg>
<seg id="30"> He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it will work, "as long as you can," because he needs the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulphur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners in the thick fumes that emanate from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems into arthritis, pain in his knees and shoulders wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Unainik who balances his basket on his back, he can do in his 53 years have only 50 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day, he and his colleagues in the volcano vydolují 15 tons of sulphur, which then three trucks taking the steep path between the trees to the warehouse in Tamansari 18 miles away.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life," says Unainik and opens up a wide, which is missing a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">The oldest of his five sons, 30-year, also makes mining of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but the continuing misery of one of the most difficult jobs in the world persists from generation to generation - craft engaged in human mules in Kawah Iljen.</seg>

<seg id="18">The government's package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">All of these measures have had little effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known konzervatizmem its leaders and strict social controls.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time the birth rate has exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a measure of recovery, in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Why Singapurci do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Mingová, director of the marriage and the family of the National Bureau of the population says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it is not only marriage and the family," he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to make is not so small home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, began to affect the trade in real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain urban areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments are in an area of 46 square meters and had great success in the marketability.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that these flats may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the developers El Developers, claiming that their "shoe box" sold far faster than larger houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"They are more popular, and it will sell for days to weeks faster than houses with bigger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new rules are clearer rules developers, who were previously limited to offer too many small houses in one of the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too stressed out</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although the new rules could lead to an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will have a big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, is that a lot of people," says the young officer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"The others have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">But for me, it is important to rely on their own time and money, "says another, about twenty, young man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women have a career, stress and the cost of living and education as the reasons that prevents them from having children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So long as the government is trying to force people to have children, they are eventually Singapurci, who have the final word on the creation of a family.</seg>

<seg id="1">What's private is private online and offline</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The privacy.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, is something that is personal in nature or the "area of private life that everyone has the right to protect themselves against any disruption."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="4">What is this privacy for people under 16 years of age?</seg>
<seg id="5">How to apply this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?</seg>
<seg id="6">He understands the dangers to which it is exposed when published on the Internet, which would certainly didn't tell anyone in the normal communication?</seg>
<seg id="7">Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent users of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="8">In four cases, consider the concept of privacy as "something entirely its own" on a personal level and for the "user name and password," if it was a social network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My biggest secret would be published," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which accounts for two years.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They are very secret secret, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"The FB I pretty pictures or pictures of how we play.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said there are known.</seg>
<seg id="13">I did not share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would embarrass someone, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, pictures of naked people or photographs of the crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge says that he knows all 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the relatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Among them is the mother, who has a name and password of one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I opened an account on Twitter to express their views and write interesting contributions.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't know if someone says to me, I'm just, "he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even if he didn't care if someone recommended by a stranger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Case of 14-year-old Jose is different.</seg>
<seg id="24">The teenager's own accounts on the networks of Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at last the network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from your list of friends.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I'm not afraid of that, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">According to this boy, he didn't instruct one of them for anything, even after it didn't address or telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If over me or demand it from me, simply remove it from your account," she says.</seg>
<seg id="28">José volunteered to Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="37">"Of course I would do it, if someone was or if I just wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="38">Even though I know that it is cyberbullying, "he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The key questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and graduate of the Education and teaching, believes that for children and adolescents in their social networks correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">It states that: "The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but when the social network, has changed the rules of the game."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article, digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">We are the digital immigrants who need to learn, and they're still learning, "he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say and what is not, in an age when they are not yet ripe."</seg>
<seg id="46">Also to be - with regard to the surroundings - reasonable, at a time when what they want most is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the Specialist is the most effective way to show children and adolescents, what's privacy, asking questions that force them to think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Furthermore, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: There are things that you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: Would you like it if someone published a picture of you as you publish a pal's?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the rest of you published?</seg>
<seg id="52">When are you calling the person in the pictures of the celebrations, did you ask them for permission?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more: They need to keep everyone to know what you're doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The other point is to realize that they must behave in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"One out of the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be on social networks," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The supervision of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is essential that the parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">"If you understand every guile, they have a good basis to talk with their children about the consequences that may be opening an account on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or to publish, "he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe's integration of</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, "South America, in this case, you really must learn from Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit Jihoamerické Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they're practically one country."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which the member countries of the Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any South American country, which is already underway between members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that we want to go back to the past," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Among other things, Ecuador's president, said that he agrees with the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that it will be reduced to the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Those who are in the lead, never to do anything, and we all signed the South Americans.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, is funded by the United States, "he said, referring to the political asylum granted Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">President Correa confirmed that he has no regrets about this decision, because it betrayed its principles, and his "profound respect for democratic values and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said that at the time, "there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice, who asked him to submit to questioning on Swedish territory because of an alleged sexual offence, "own Swedish legislation enables the videokonferenčním call, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa has said that there is a risk that Assangeho there is a deterioration in the physical and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I haven't talked to him since he is in the embassy, and the ambassador has informed me that he has a lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorean head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"There is, however, that his physical and psychological condition deteriorates because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.</seg>
<seg id="15">It would have affected the health of everyone, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">President Correa said that resolving the asylum granted Assange from June to still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and pointed out that the London talks in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"We're not negotiating with respect to human rights, in this case, we don't use that word, but still continued talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings in the various European bodies, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">He said that "if the United Kingdom will pass tomorrow, it's all over."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears the still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the legislation without a problem, as has been done in other cases, this problem will be made tomorrow. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took advantage of this situation to be presented as a defender of freedom of the press, and make it clear that he does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lies which undermine the freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">The biggest enemies of a free press is not us, mean-spirited and vicious politicians, but bad news in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">From this point of view, expressed his pleasure at the fact that no such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic control over the country and even the bourgeoisie Ecuador," and said that, if re-elected, "will continue the changes led by the right way and in the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto by Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur until at least its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus wrapped in the legality," because in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">In addition, Ecuador's president, said that it is "entirely appropriate" for the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment the judgment is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It is a problem between the South American and-countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome will walk together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is widely considered to be overcome, and was able to go forward. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It also expressed the hope for a settlement of the maritime border, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "the right to search for Latin America is an international resort, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, whatever it hard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In connection with the possibility that he may run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to run for a third mandate, he said, that he sees the possibility of "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, retire from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"I personally never cared much, but so unfair situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only to political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">My political movement believed that I who guarantees this unlikely victory, then we must accept this responsibility, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"If I had won, it would be my last term, and then I walked away from politics.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, it's the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="37">I've decided, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez has left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected at the end of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not a relapse in the health of the president, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The head of the Ecuadorian state is now part of the sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain the development, equality and security.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The AIDS victims are the result of the late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the results of his test: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if the lightning struck me," says the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "mitigate" a bit, but apparently without success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy's in front of the family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to take his own illness on their shoulders and began to inform on her and with such vigor that he celebrated the 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of the earliest Units of HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, the director of the clinic with him or the Social Security Institute (IMSS) said good-bye, "because he was cut."</seg>
<seg id="9">That was when AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, there are a lot of people don't know about his illness and come when the virus has caused the destruction of the body's immune system and vysílil, and become the victims of random infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years since AIDS appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success that the life expectancy of the patient, who in a timely and appropriate manner to begin with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of Unit of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektolog and an expert on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability, the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, the better are those who are taking drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells for up to 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, it means that the one who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with the treatment to live up to 75 years without any problems," he said in an interview with the doctor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate has dropped significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (yearbook Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics, 60 percent of patients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in the state of Jalisco in 2011 255 people died, and in May, 187. However, since 2005, is a universal access to antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why do people continue to die from the effects of the disease?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - "It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The way I see it, that's going on with us in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of supplies of medicines, the problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Adds compelling figure: "Nine out of ten patients comes when there will be an associated infections. What needs to be done, we could have more impact on the overall mortality rate is used to diagnose the disease, and therefore it should be on a large scale to offer tests to detect the disease to all persons who request it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In its proposal is consistent with specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came into the private lab tests to be done just because it was his friend, and despite his young age he had already suffered from AIDS and Kaposi s sarcoma, a cancer which is one of the most common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and they don't want to know anything else.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I have to die, I'd rather be vyřádím three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. "</seg>
<seg id="28">To this day, his parents knows only that he suffered from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I live a normal life like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person, "lists Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco that today, in the framework of the World AIDS day motivated their testimony of those who are afraid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Whatever they do tests. If risk, so let them know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, it's better, and if you have been diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, they will be held accountable."</seg>
<seg id="32">This sums up his message to the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds information about the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest gaps are in the prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places that are dedicated to this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us the packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What do you want?" Is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and medical personnel that adolescents want to avoid, he tells a reporter.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested this inefficient distribution change. Condoms are not just for the consoles, but the hundred dávkovačích whatever is in public restrooms, in places frequented by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It's not promoting promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It's not to pay them a beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district.</seg>
<seg id="42">Takovásexualita. It is best to make condoms to those who already have a sex life, "he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The key figures in the state of Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There have been 13 435 cases (12 of 158 cases of AIDS and HIV-1 317 cases).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">This is the fourth place in Mexico in new and recorded cases of AIDS and the 13th place in the context of HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the diseases in a sexual way, 6% and 2% perinatálně blood along the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is estimated that the HIV virus can live for about 50,000 people, because on the one registered case is four to five people who don't know about the disease.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The judgment of the court of appeal in the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company Grupo Vitro established bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country, and the problem of solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Therefore, it seems that corporate restructuring procedures, which allow Mexican laws in the country lanes and stars, despite international agreements does not apply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The approval of a decision by 15 June last year, a judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves the Mexican firms in practice without a defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the ruling opens the door for the Mexican producers of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against the three irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">First of all, it should be noted that while the judge in this case contends that the creditors are governed by the Insolvency Act of the United States, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides for the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">First, it would suggest a lack of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact, it was for this purpose, the United Nations created a model for the unification of international trade law, which determines the organisation arbiter of the American Law Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgment states that without a vote of branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, would not achieve the required majority for approval of the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the possibility of Mexican laws allow.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose in-house debts guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the creditors - who would be against the company Vitro stood before a court in the United States, which funds "vultures" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - not the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From another point of view, blaming the company Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal for reconsideration of the Court of Appeal that the examination was carried out with the full participation of, that is, with the participation of the five judges, as originally voted only three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">If he fails here, it will require a revision of the appeal process higher instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In this case, it is significant that the court failed to document sent to the Mexican government as the amicus curiae, which is described in detail the company Vitro under the bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company had eased by adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to confronted the law with Chapter 15 of the insolvency law of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Navícse points out that the country has subjected the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The impact on both sides: The penalty for the company Vitro and state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The overall evaluation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On the table lay unnoticed for several months of the criminal complaint against the former owner of the aviation company Gastónu Azcárraga Andrademu, who was accused of fraud, and the pilots' union has already overflowed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was linked with the Salo sport for more than 60 years and traveled with him all over the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories in the history of the local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Reyes was before he was caught by a stroke in 2008 in a wheelchair, dedicated to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player under the categories, a National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or the president Portorické basketball federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I was in the course of his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, like when I was in the 1990s, president of the National League BSN, general manager and president of the Federation of the national team," said Reyes when visiting reporters from the newspaper Primera Hora at their home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years, with Isabel, his faithful wife.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball has been my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes in his statement wasn't exaggerating.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all of which are decorated with pictures and souvenir of his long career, show it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the greatest emotion of all are those that are reminiscent of his tenure at los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"It was my best years, I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be with the team los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in the eight championships, whether as the owner, co-owner or trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one playoff - in 1981, when he made his debut in the BSN Jerome Mincy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach and by the time he was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told me:" I've got a big 6-foot player.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you want it? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">I then recommended Bartow rozehrávače Gausseho Raymond, who became a member of the team, and one of our best shooters.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that he said that if Mincy Bayamonu will bring victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to the next. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship, when he played for the team los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, because already in 1988 as president of the basketball federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time, he wanted to devote his functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up, but we have the bronze for the Canadian referee, who let us repeat the final face-off, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team that you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">He is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the national team in Panamerických Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we have guys trounced the United States team, which was quite similar to that we blew bronze at the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico Lopez and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>

<seg id="1">The course, which examines the "end of the world."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week, students will examine the apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">When the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to do a course this semester on the end of the world, he knew that it is an irresistible temptation: The end of "a number of" Mayského calendar that has come December 21, caught many people as evidence that the world is coming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Charmé, however, had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: The catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call "Armageddon" debt, and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, the place where Christians teoretizujících by the end of the world to begin the Apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I didn't realize that this will be nejapokalyptičtější semester ever," said Charmé students this week, Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="6">When one discusses what is happening today in the world, as if we had 30 days, it's really a good time.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that the wrong means for the apocalyptic-minded good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And it is not the only professor, which offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is, in theory, the last in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry vacker course "Means, culture and the end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week, students will examine the apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We discuss these ideas to expand over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that are governed by some human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">If, for example, the nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war could erupt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, students analyze films with apokalyptickými themes and examine how they differ from the examples from real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and the impossible," says vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania got together Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, to hold a course with a simple name of the End of the World.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Nepřipojujeme" 2012, "because we always expect with the possibility of a rate again in the event that the world will not end," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "impending doom" to students to study, create projects and make the final test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At Penn State, the final test will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which makes students no choice but to work "until the end of the evening in the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses have become quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Spread within two hours," said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which had 35.</seg>
<seg id="21">For weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mail questions whether it is still in place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students have been assured that the course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console ourselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="24">And, therefore, the apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs, it is only a matter of comfort or lack of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Wekesa, 25 year-old student of psychology and nursing, said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I've never heard of an hour in which it might teach," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I'm enjoying it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But no vyzpovídaný student, let alone a professor, said that he believes in the date of the end of December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project was about the Mayan predictions and vyvracíme it in some way," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá student last year at Temple of West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"The Mayans never had not foreseen the end of the world; it is a key point in the calendar," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back centuries in which people respond to changes in their environment predictions about the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">Such speculation has caused the Internet to flourish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Some people think about it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is in the vast majority in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, the question of whether there is a course on the "end of the world," he answered quickly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines is not the end of the world," he wrote, and he made an exception for the highest office.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall said that during the years of talk about the last days of the court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking about the next date immediately," or philosophy that the 21st December is the start of a seven-year period, at the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Date take lightly the students and professors.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several of them said that they intend to go to the "end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"I guess I'll call a few friends, we laughed together," explained the twenty-year-old communications student Samir Ford.</seg>
