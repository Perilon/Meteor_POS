<h1>
<seg id="1">A republican strategy of the resistance to the repeated election of Obama </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The republicans' leaders justified their policy with the necessity of struggle with falsifications in an election. </seg>
<seg id="3">However at the Center Brennana believes the last the myth asserting that the cases of falsifications in an election in the United States are rarer than the cases of death from lightning stroke. </seg>
<seg id="4">The republicans' lawyers have besides counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">To one say with certainty: is possible these new tendencies will have negative influence on the electors' attendance. </seg>
<seg id="6">Actions, in this sense similar, partially discredit a system of American democracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada the American states bear responsibility for an organization of the federal election in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="8">Just therefore the majority of the governments of the states since 2009 adopt laws, complicating a process of the registration or a voting. </seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has received a new scope after the election in November 2010 which has brought the republicans 675 new places in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 bills, restricting right of the voice in 41 states, were mistaken only for the alone year 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New laws of an election require an elector to show the identity card with photography and a proof of the presence of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12">Besides that these laws reduce a period of a voting ahead of schedule, abolish right of a registration of an elector in a day of will and take away right of the voice from the citizens having conviction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before an election of 2006 not a single American state obliged the electors to show the identity card with photography. </seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana has become the first state which has introduced a similar requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15">The supreme court of the USA confirmed constitutionality of law, adopted in Indiana, in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities have hurried to spread this practice also other states. </seg>
<seg id="17">During the two last years they initiated bills, obliging the electors to show the identity cards with photography, in 34 states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that unlike Quebec the American citizens haven't such a universal identity card as a card of medical insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, 11 % of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people that have been at age, necessary for a voting, haven't the identity card with a photograph of their staff, yielded by the governmental organ. </seg>
<seg id="20">Besides that, five million new electors in 2012 haven't a similar document. </seg>
<seg id="21">In this case the cost of reception of the necessary identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect the youth, minorities and the people with the low level of the incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25 % of Afro-Americans, 15 % of people, earning 000 dollars less than 35, 18 % of citizens are older than 65 years and 20 % of electors haven't from 18 to 29 years the necessary identity card with photography. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But all of it yet not. </seg>
<seg id="25">The students - the electors who as reckons, vote for the candidates the democrats, for several states it isn't permitted to use the identity card with photography, yielded by their training institution. </seg>
<seg id="26">But the same states permit the members of the fishing and hunting clubs which vote in the main thing for the republicans to use the certificates, yielded by these clubs, for a voting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not a single state required before 2004 a proof of the presence of American citizenship for a voting. </seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time the similar requirement was brought in in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29">Beginning with 2011 more than ten states have adopted laws, requiring the electors to prove that they are the citizens of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="30">These measures obviously are aimed at the fact to restrict a voting of the descendants of the Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31">It is believed that two thirds of the Latin-American electors vote in favour to the Democratic party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Besides that the republican lawmakers initiated laws, abolishing a registration of the electors in a day of voting in eight states, in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="33">They have also restricted right of the individuals or the groups to give help to ones who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction hasn't taken place without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35">So, 2004 years, for example are during an election the campaign of a registration of the electors has helped to introduce about 10 million citizens from the lists. </seg>
<seg id="36">In the same time measures taken beginning with 2009, have brought to fall on 17 % of level of the registration of the new electors in the year 2010 in comparison with 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition republican lawmakers have adopted laws, aimed at reduction of a period of a voting ahead of schedule, in five other states. </seg>
<seg id="38">So during the general election of the year 2008 in Florida 33 % of electors that were voting were the Afro-Americans, although the last were only 13 % of the common number of electors of the state ahead of time. </seg>
<seg id="39">The same happened also to the descendants of the Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40">Presenting only 11 % of electors they were 24 % of the citizens who voted ahead of time. </seg>
<seg id="41">Which unlike white forming 76 % of electors among being voting were only 46 % ahead of time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The, of course, lawmakers-democrats and their partisans actively oppose acceptance of laws, restricting a registration of the electors. </seg>
<seg id="43">Several projects of laws were the vetirovano governors-democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44">The action of the most ambiguous laws was suspended in intervention by the General Prosecutor of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45">It has allowed partially restricting of negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46">Laws, requiring producing of the identity card with photography, have accepted so, for example only 16 of the 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless the new rules that have entered action certainly will complicate exercise of selective right in an election of 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The critics from the democrats condemn a prejudice of the laws which were adopted seeing obvious orientation to the fact to influence results of the election of the year 2012 in the key states in them. </seg>
<seg id="49">The report of the center of Brennana from 2011 demonstrates that the states that have adopted these laws present 171 of the 270 voices, necessary in the electors' board to win the presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">To assert with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will have essential influence on results of the presidential election of 2012 is else too early. </seg>
<seg id="51">Only one is doubtless: these new theses will have negative influence on the electors' attendance. </seg>
<seg id="52">Actions, in this sense similar, partially discredit a system of American democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1">Screening of cancer of the prostate gland: study a test or not? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In fact the test for a dog gives the occasionally erroneous results false negative, and occasionally also false positive which result in useless medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="3">The men, also so reluctantly passing medical monitoring, have something to doubt from even more. </seg>
<seg id="4">To study a test or not? </seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked two specialists' opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In investigations, carried out in the United States, the numerous cases of infection among the investigated groups were observed, it is difficult to interpret therefore obtained data and it is difficult to produce any distinct recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="7">The other European investigation on this time has detected the different level of mortality at those patients who have passed screening, and ones who didn't pass him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This investigation has also shown after 12 year-old observation that it is the probability of appearance, the metastasis is on higher for 30-40 % up with ones who haven't passed screening. </seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore I would recommend to study a test beginning approximately 50 years, or since 40 if one of the direct kinsmen had cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="10">The men of Afro-American origin are also subject to heightened risk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Acceptance of a correct solution is once the crayfish is detected the key moment. </seg>
<seg id="12">The crayfish can be both aggressive, and slow. </seg>
<seg id="13">It is for a patient necessary to explain the degree of risk of his cancerous disease, proposing the possible versions to it, without obligatory treatment of the cancer of the prostate which doesn't constitute danger for life in long-term prospect, and making a choice in these cases in favour to active observation of a disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For today many the men at which the cancer, course for treatment is revealed, won't elapse for their cancer is not aggressive and doesn't represent threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="15">We shall propose active observation to them, and if the disease begins to progress, we shall begin treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">All we with precision define as more frequent criteria for making of a decision on one who is have to or hasn't to study course for treatment. </seg>
<seg id="17">Thus I would recommend nevertheless to study a test. </seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to also consult about the doctor to define if it is necessary or not to study this test. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">There are urologies in the cooperation with the International association, Movember has created an instrument, allowing estimating of everything behind and against a pass of a test for a dog. </seg>
<seg id="20">It is possible to download this document (as long as in the English language the translation is accessible in the near future) to the address: http:// ca.movember com/ fr/ mens-health/ prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent a disease </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Regretfully miracle recipe doesn't exist to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="23">Notwithstanding progress of scientific researches observance of the healthy lifestyle remains the best way to decrease risk of a disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is believed that, if all people superbly fed, and sufficiently moved, to prevent would be is for 30 % of cases rako possible. </seg>
<seg id="25">"If nobody more smoked this figure would grow at least to 50 %" - the, Andre Bol'e underlines, press secretary of the Canadian association of the crayfish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However by estimations, 10 % of the crayfish's cases are caused by the heredity. </seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of the crayfish remain perfectly inexplicable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian association of the crayfish struggle with smoking remains priority notwithstanding decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is connected with 85 % of cases of cancer of the lungs. </seg>
<seg id="30">And it is the factor of risk for many other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It causes severe harm to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today 1,5 million smokers - in Quebec exist", press secretary Andre Bol'e speaks. </seg>
<seg id="33">A fact: in 10 years after a refusal of smoking risk to die from cancer diminishes half giving hope. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to data of punishments the redundant weight and the obesity also contribute to appearance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="36">They increase risk of appearance of cancer of the mammary gland, the large and direct intestine, the gullet, the pancreas gland and the womb. </seg>
<seg id="37">"Investigations show that the regular physical activity during the whole life protects against cancer of the large intestine" -, is added to the Associations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Supply </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Also the association recommends to restrict consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities it increases risks of appearance of cancer of the thick bowels. </seg>
<seg id="41">It is necessary to avoid also the sausage articles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Temporarily closing of meat by smoke-drying, drying or salting can result in formation of the carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="43">"The last can cause harm to the cages of the body and result in the development of a crayfish" -, is explained in an Association. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The vitamins </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the last years many scientists dealt with investigation into influence of vitaminic additions on the development of a crayfish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But for a given moment it is impossible to name the results of these investigations unambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="47">In opinion SCC investigations into vitamin E give contradictory results. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them has shown decrease in risk of the development of cancer of the prostate then other has given opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="49">There also is no full clarity in estimation of influence on the development of a crayfish of vitamin D. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">However Mr Bol'yo emphasizes that it is important to discuss its worries and family anamnesis with a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="51">"The surrender of analysis doesn't result in cancer". </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Boson Khiggsa is in the details </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In past summer the message of the fact that the scientists perhaps have succeeded in detecting boson Khiggsa caused real flurry - also not without cause. </seg>
<seg id="3">It isn't believed little that explain this boson the mass of all particles in the universe, nor much. </seg>
<seg id="4">Besides that it was the last particle existence of which was is predicted in the frames to Standard the models -, it the best, or, in any case the "the least imperfect" description of nature and behaviour of matter, - but which earlier didn't prove possible to detect us in an experimental way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But the physicists as far back as not before the end are sure that the matter concerns just about boson Khiggsa. </seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without shadow of doubt that we have an affair with an indeed new particle and that she strongly resembles boson Khiggsa, predicted by the Standard model. </seg>
<seg id="7">Besides that new presented data are in this week on one large physical congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed, although for full certainty of some data don't obtain yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">We shall imagine nevertheless that the matter concerns about boson Khiggsa, for we also shall see the chances to be mistaken seem the minimum that mean it *really*/*the_same*. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Is, in this world one law is perfectly unavoidable, saying that two things cannot turn out in the same place in the same time. </seg>
<seg id="10">No possibility, to bypass this rule is even not try too diligently, otherwise you will harm to itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although physics of the elementary particles is, it turns out that there in it too is one law of the similar character: the principle of exception Pauls which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space in the same moment of the time if they stay in the same "quantal state" enough strange peace this "state" is concluded, in the common lines, in their some descriptions -. </seg>
<seg id="12">Proceeding from it the physicists divide the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="13">We find the respectable citizens named fermionami who are judiciously subordinated to a principle Pauls in an alone corner. </seg>
<seg id="14">In different fuss the bosons, the infamous gang of the anarchists who haven't respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can imperturbably turn out in the same place in the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As a site, (by the way perfectly unusual), imparts Particle Adventure of Berkeley's Laboratory these bosons, the groups: the X-particles, to which boson Khiggsa relates divide in its turn into two about which we here shan't speak, and "the particles of force", by which and in some kind the basic forces of nature spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is necessary to emphasize these most bosons, such exotic creatures as it was possible to think are not everything. </seg>
<seg id="17">In fact if you succeed in reading this chronicle then which due to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or "a particle of light" is it is "a courier" of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when one particle, having an electric charge, accelerates or changes a direction it "violates" the electromagnetic field in this particular place about as a stone, thrown to a pond. </seg>
<seg id="19">From this "violation" the electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), is born, and not what other as a photon - and, subsequently, one of the bosons "of the carriers of force" this wave is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A more stable field </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same happens also to boson Khiggsa, only that difference that, so that this boson appears the other field, Khiggsa field must be "violated". </seg>
<seg id="22">An only very large stone, to reach very and very high energies, as if the matter concerned about the pond the surface of which was able that has frozen to shake Khiggsa field is to excite him necessary is however much much more stable than the electromagnetic field;. </seg>
<seg id="23">Here why is the huge accelerator of the particles as one who is exploited in Tarna - the Large Hadron Collider, being a ring with the diameter of 27 kilometres! - for achievement of so huge energies, necessary.! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with an electromagnetic field is useful also also to the explanation of correlation between boson Khiggsa and mass. </seg>
<seg id="25">In fact not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="26">Some as, for example the magnets one interacts, different - there is: the sheet no paper, for example never won't *HOLD$ON* oneself on a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="27">Particles as though as not all interact with a field of Khiggsa: ones who interact, have mass, whereas other (as a photon by the way) haven't her. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Thus what "can all these investigations bring", does Mrs. Plamondon ask? </seg>
<seg id="29">They are used for science for a checkup of correctness of the Standard Model (centimetre), and it also allows the physicists to fumble with disagreement between results of observations and the forecasts of centimetre. </seg>
<seg id="30">Besides some of them passionately are willing that such a disagreement will transpire, by the volume to the smallest mismatch can open a door for "new physics" and stop up some holes of the Model. </seg>
<seg id="31">The last, it is necessary to say everything, else has the essential shortcomings not proposing any explanation for the which for gravitation (ouch) or dark matter forms about 80 % of the universe (ouch *THE*th)!. </seg>
<seg id="32">But as long as such disagreements haven't been found in Tarna. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Consequence </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">To predict benefit of these investigations to everyday life of the average person is more difficult, but it would be a mistake to suppose that there is no her. </seg>
<seg id="35">Look: at the very beginning of the 60th years the pioneers of investigations into a laser of Bell's laboratories wouldn't be able even also to suppose what revolution their works will cause. </seg>
<seg id="36">They foresaw their applications in science, but that is not more. </seg>
<seg id="37">Even the indeed deceased physicist Uillard Bojl who worked in the Laboratories of Bell where in 1960 the laser, was invented and which oneself has developed, the first continuous laser (previous were the impulse) in 1962 yrs, said that the laser had been initially considered rather as "laboratory gadget". </seg>
<seg id="38">Present… </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides that, the application can be found for the tooling accompanying investigation. </seg>
<seg id="40">The, for example one of most Uilliard Bojl during its optical investigations in 1969 has developed a small sensor of light. </seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, although it quite wasn't its initial predestination now serves as "the eye" for all the digital cameras of the world and has deserved the Nobel prize in physics 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">It, of course, doesn't mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider necessarily will change our life, but it only shows in fact that everything can be. </seg>

<seg id="47">Also some institutions, such an as a shelter Victor-Gadbua and a Society of palliative maintenance on a house of the Large Montreal specialize more or less exceptionally in departure of the cancerous patients. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="48">Just this large blank of a system of health protection of Quebec makes many doctors - of the specialists in palliative departure fear acceptance of a law, legalizing euthanasia and help in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="49">Beginning with October circulates the manifest, signed by leading lights of the domain of palliative departure, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and doctor Bernard Lyapuantom, also testifying to their disagreement with a similar initiative. </seg>
<seg id="50">According to the words of doctor Christian Martel' the system of health protection of Quebec is insufficiently effective to insure right of palliative departure of high quality before a transition to euthanasia will be resolved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She - speaks I saw the patient who has spent 14 days in the section on emergency aid, in fearful pains, and nobody, haven't recently - taken necessary measures to facilitate them. </seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that the patients wish to die only because they don't receive adequate departure. </seg>
<seg id="53">In the same time many oncologists try before the last day to salvage the patients notwithstanding the pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for Ellen's survival Richard have already been the minimum, when it stopped tiring out chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="55">When I reported to my oncologist that I stopped treatment, she has answered to me, that regret that I stop struggle -, she tells. </seg>
<seg id="56">In this case she herself told me that my days were believed! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no omnipotent departure </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Doctor Martel' believes that which ask 90 % of patients about death, thank the medical staff for the fact that they haven't granted their request, after the command over palliative departure relieves their pain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">It is however necessary to note that palliative departure isn't absolutely omnipotent in struggle with pain. </seg>
<seg id="60">According to the words of *Elsie* Monroe, the director from palliative departure in a Society of palliative departure on a house of the Large Montreal the patients are not receptive to anaesthetization in 8 % of cases. </seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life the doctors often resort to palliative sedatsii, at which the patient sleeps before a moment of its death, either from time to time, or permanently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">One may not more pretend that we don't know of these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="63">All more often and more often the patients who don't succeed in relieving pain will be able to have access to palliative sedatsii. </seg>
<seg id="64">The patients, suffering from pain, always say the same sentence: "YA want to die". </seg>
<seg id="65">But not necessarily it means that "I want that for me euthanasia will be conducted", it means that "I want that I shall feel more at ease". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"I wonder how this system after all means were let into an affair, Jacques Dyusheno, the deputy and the former chief of the police of Montreal jokes, spills". </seg>
<seg id="5">Just due to him the scandal as collateral in 2011 broke out, the result of investigation into official crimes, connected with the road construction contracts in Quebec, on which is prime minister of that time from the liberals Jean Share, have agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="6">"Dyusheno report" has established a direct connection between an industry, secret financing of the political parties and corruption. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"From the beginning of investigation in 2010, he, only the one Ministry of the transport underline, would keep a billion dollars on the contracts" if some restrained their instincts to take a share. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">The created in 2011 Permanent subdivision in struggle with corruption the vast staff of the governmental auditors, the investigators and the analysts has been included into composition of which has switched to an affair. </seg>
<seg id="11">And, besides that, the employees of the special subdivision "Hammer", who after 2009 have made "the drain cartel" of Montreal, stop overstatement are the costs of the contracts. </seg>
<seg id="12">Over a distance of the last weeks the series of searches was carried out, and accusations of fraud and corruption some municipal officials, in particular the Franc Zampino and Richard Markottu - the mayor of the small small town, were made. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">There is Gilles Vajyankur, having recently resigned from an office of mayor Lavalya, third in the value of the city of province Quebec, the office, on the queue. </seg>
<seg id="14">He is suspected of multiple reception of the bribes in locating of the state orders. </seg>
<seg id="15">Besides that official accusation was made several engineers of the service of the ways of the message of Montreal and the construction contractors of Italian origin of including Tony Akkurso and Lino with a Deputy beaten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The last has exploded a real bomb reporting to investigation "about a system" of reception of the state contracts. </seg>
<seg id="17">During several years of Deputy beaten gave back to of the 3 % cost of the contracts, made in Montreal, for a certain intermediary tied together with a mafia who in one's turn transfered money of the party of mayor Zheral'da Tramble "the Combined Montreal". </seg>
<seg id="18">In the 2000th years of Deputy beaten littered money to the right and to the left It has listed more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (there are 000 euros near 68) different the parties of the province, in the main thing the liberals that were having the power then. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">"The system" of corruption worked in Montreal faultlessly. </seg>
<seg id="22">Gilles Syurprenan, the engineer that was being over a civil construction in detail has described her in front of a commission: behind he has received ten years from the construction companies of gifts, invitations into the journeys, on the tournaments in golf, to the restaurants, on the matches in hockey also of the bribes there are 000 dollars altogether on 736 of which in exchange for the sewerage contracts the cost he overstated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other official persons, responsible for a construction of the roads, have confessed that they received on the paw overstating the accounts 30-40 % with the help of the false complements. </seg>
<seg id="24">Then one organizer from the party of mayor Martan Dyumon accused Mr Tramble of the fact that it deliberately closed the eyes with existence of the parallel budget that was filling the party cash desks with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="25">After these revelations Mr Tramble has resigned at the beginning of November immersing Montreal in a serious crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Shantal' *RULO* was alone from the first deputies in Montreal that have set up alarm. </seg>
<seg id="27">The mayor is Riv'er-environment de-Preri in the east of an island her, oppose since 2010 to a sale of the municipal bought area, 5 million are for the dollars and construction boom, resold… for 1,6 million to the developers in height. </seg>

<seg id="29">She says that in the investigation which in the final analysis will be begun, she "will pull the thread, allowing understanding of functioning of the system, swarming with the ants to stop gangrene and define culpable". </seg>
<seg id="30">This process she kharakterezuet as "is sickly, but is positive". </seg>
<seg id="31">We are in a process of cleaning of a wound, but the own investigation group and an observer, for Montreal will be necessary to avoid return of doubtful practices. </seg>
<seg id="32">As we tidy up at home. </seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Dyusheno notices from his side that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but a role "of the elective official officials, that knew of this scheme", but being not participating in machinations worries especially him. </seg>
<seg id="35">Taking into account that the share of dirty money of financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70 % he jokes: "I have been said that it was only pale reflection of reality". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec proposes to restrict up to 100 dollars of donation to the parties, but, according to its words, it won't change a situation: "As long as we shan't restrict elective expenses strictly there will be dirty money in a politician". </seg>
<seg id="37">He requires full rearrangement of a system of allocation of the state contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot lower lower; boldly bottoming the essence of the things, we shall be able to build a house on the more solid foundation, with the best control and legality". </seg>

<seg id="1">"PSZH - not the Soccer Club Barcelona"! </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you into PSZH attained an unusual scope. </seg>
<seg id="3">How will you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="4">It can be explained with individual consciousness, but can - also by new measurement PSZH. </seg>
<seg id="5">The great players have come. </seg>
<seg id="6">Next to them I grow each day. </seg>
<seg id="7">Also the technical personnel has introduced much. </seg>
<seg id="8">These factors make me daily raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="9">And during a match, it is simpler. </seg>
<seg id="10">Everything happens in football very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="11">But I don't incense. </seg>
<seg id="12">From the very beginning at the center of preliminary preparation into NIF into Klerfontene and before my coming in Sep-Et'en I always marched ahead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus you benefit a competition, set by Carlo Anchelotti… </seg>
<seg id="14">The replenishment of this summer must hold not the novelty the matches of the very high level. </seg>
<seg id="15">They know also that each training is very important. </seg>
<seg id="16">It results in the fact that such a player as me is willing to be at the level and bear down in the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="17">Besides that Carlo Anchelotti shows a support in my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="18">Such deputies as Claude Makelele who played at the same position that me help him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Anchelotti - the master of a position? </seg>
<seg id="20">Of course. </seg>
<seg id="21">Anchelotti enjoys respect the whole technical personnel. </seg>
<seg id="22">There today to him are no equal in the First League, and he is included into the number of the best trainers of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="23">He has vast experiment, and it has won many titles with the high-end clubs. </seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with the great players. </seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring the new titles for Paris. </seg>
<seg id="26">With me with him there was the talk giving hope in the January. </seg>
<seg id="27">Then I drew back from the entire series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence which he has me also explains my achievements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of season PSZH? </seg>
<seg id="30">In the First League Lyon has taken away the leader's place from us. </seg>
<seg id="31">But we, as before, are ready. </seg>
<seg id="32">One of our basic aims is the Champion's: League we were exquisitely qualified into one the eighth the final. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the aim of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="34">We shall try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="35">Henceforth everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="36">We shall be able to say our word by the face to the face with the very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="37">We at first want to finish in the first in our group, in front of *PORTO* to have a possibility to receive an answering match for one of the eighth of the final. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Will PSZH be able to become the first-class European club in short-term prospect? </seg>
<seg id="39">He for it has a budget already… </seg>
<seg id="40">It is for that to become the large European club for Paris necessary to win the titles and fasten the positions on long-term perspective. </seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="42">Financially PSZH have means to make this project real. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not to take a title in the First League as in past season, will be a large failure? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be large disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="45">In this year we strongly wish actual to hook in this champion title. </seg>
<seg id="46">In past season we were to it near. </seg>
<seg id="47">The disappointment in May was because we had everything to come to finish the first. </seg>
<seg id="48">It was very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="49">We have finished him with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="50">The champion's title supposes, as a rule, 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="51">But the other command, has played more more fantastic season with Montpellier. </seg>
<seg id="52">In this year, I think, everything will be in an order. </seg>
<seg id="53">Notwithstanding the fact that struggle for a title have started such strong commands as Marseilles, Lyon and Bordeaux I think that we have forces to win. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Don't you think that the mass media expect too much from PSZH? </seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that from us is expected much how much taking into account was inserted, and which the players with us are. </seg>
<seg id="56">We are completely ready for it. </seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we win the houses 4-0 against Trua and we are nevertheless found for what criticize, of course, a little it upsets. </seg>
<seg id="58">We have a question what primarily the people expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to win each weekend with score 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the Soccer Club Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="61">We try to introduce the project of a game. </seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed with the time. </seg>
<seg id="63">We have proved in the Champion's League that we can accept the modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="64">Look, on Manchester, united which doesn't succeed already two seasons in going into the one eighth the final, although they have too spent huge money! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Taking embedded sums into account we presented you on 15 points ahead already to the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="66">It would be neglect of our opponents and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseilles which weren't at the height in past season, was "awakened" by it new PSZH. </seg>
<seg id="68">It shows that the First League is to what extent fascinating. </seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we shall be able to smile and tell myself that notwithstanding all difficulties we have won at result. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">PSZH, it seems, completely depends on the feats of Zlatana Ibragimovicha. </seg>
<seg id="71">Well, and that, if it is told that some "Zlatanozavisimost'" exists. </seg>
<seg id="72">It only means that Ibragimovich is very successful, and that he scores many goals. </seg>
<seg id="73">He has come for it, and he proves that he is a star of the First League. </seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere where he played, he has shown that he is the great player and is a star of the world scale. </seg>
<seg id="75">In a group we esteem as a person and as a player him. </seg>
<seg id="76">He too esteems the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="77">The fact that it has made, it is indeed exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="78">It stimulates also different to improve its game. </seg>
<seg id="79">T'yago Silva which is one of the best defenders in the world, also justify everybody move ahead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you outlived by Euro-2012 from the national team of France? </seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="82">I strongly wished to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="83">Regretfully my injury has hampered me in snatching a little playing time. </seg>
<seg id="84">I saw many things there, and I have gone out from there more strongly. </seg>
<seg id="85">Today I succeed in holding the good qualifying matches. </seg>
<seg id="86">It is one, for which I hoped from a moment of my baptism at Blue. </seg>
<seg id="87">We have extracted the lessons from the fact that have happened in the Ukraine, and now have to behave exemplarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshama at the head Blue? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They for him are effective. </seg>
<seg id="90">He has the good positions in a qualifying group to world championship. </seg>
<seg id="91">He is a strict trainer, he is close to the players and inspires on a victory. </seg>
<seg id="92">Which Loran Blan was. </seg>
<seg id="93">But I wouldn't want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="94">Blan has achieved the aim, he qualified us into a Euro. </seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Desham will bring Blue to Brazil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The good deserved draw (1-1), torn out on 16 October in Spain, is the basic match? </seg>
<seg id="97">This match has given belief in itself to us. </seg>
<seg id="98">Each combated for everybody. </seg>
<seg id="99">Before this shock in Spain, in my career the similar matches weren't. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless the European central bank (ETSB) in its report of virtual currency, published in October, has got interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="10">He describes bitkojn as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with a dollar or a euro", also "similar to common currencies". </seg>
<seg id="11">Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as "the credits", used for advancement in the video game, which work too much in a process of the game, or to which buy (and occasionally also exchange) is possible. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network function? </seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users happens in fact between two electronic addresses, like an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="17">The user can choose the other address only for each new payment providing anonymity with such an image. </seg>
<seg id="18">The set of information, relating to this transaction, signs electronically, with use of a system of encryption with a double key. </seg>

<seg id="24">The computers "take" new transaction and add her number, everybody together is in front of that as "hash". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim consists in the fact to find the number which will give unique digital signature (many zeroes at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="26">Once this number is found other nodes easily check that it is correct. </seg>
<seg id="27">nerarzryvno the transaction in such a way turns out connected with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">If with a view on deception the user very quickly (less than in ten minutes) would wish to pay two times with alone also to a theme, only one of these two transactions was confirmed network - and other would remain unconfirmed, for they have different electronic signatures money. </seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that has solved a task receives 50 bitkojnov. </seg>

<seg id="4">Finding everybody off guard he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutive assembly would vote over a final text for the next day. </seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly the week ago the head of the state granted two additional months to a Meeting to finish work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The how Egypt leans against preliminary text which several times the corrections were made, which loosens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions, prompt already two years. </seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has only reinforced separation of a country. </seg>
<seg id="8">In his opponents' opinion the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" continuing "to break a given word" and "trample right". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In a camp of his followers sure that it is a way to finish with the institutional and political crisis accelerating a transitive process. </seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum must be conducted during fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="11">The very short period of the time which a text, the article behind an article make the Brothers give up intention to explain to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="12">For the president it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent rages over the whole country. </seg>
<seg id="13">Muhammed Morsi, convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively as he declared in one interview with an American weekly newspaper Time seems. </seg>
<seg id="14">All the more that the appeal for an accelerated voting resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave yourselves the extraordinary authorities" which, as is assumed, must finish after acceptance of the Constitution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constitutive assembly, the Islamists are from the *greater* part was voted for a text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="16">The liberals' majority haven't responded on call. </seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, shortly before a constitutional declaration they flapped a door feeling not in state to bring their opinion. </seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of the defenders of human rights, religious minorities or a civil society have made the same. </seg>
<seg id="19">So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, the spare participants were hastily added yesterday by the morning. </seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to Brothers-Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="21">Not surprise is that the articles had voted unanimously the majority of the cases. </seg>
<seg id="22">That fact that one of the few discords of day has arisen around… the time of a prayer, since some members of a committee have believed that the hours of the Constitutive assembly were incorrectly tuned by the way has amused the commentators. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text over which yesterday the voting walked some more consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="24">The object of universal attention the article 2 in the final analysis has remained the the identical article from Constitution is 1971 years old, saying that "the principles of Shariat are the basic source of right". </seg>
<seg id="25">Salafistskie the batches for which introduction of Islamic right is one of the basic requirements, "the principles" hoped to replace "with the rules" that would give a possibility of their stricter application. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">That fact that this article wasn't changed, *BE* an evidence of their goodwill and respect to other participants of an Egyptian society is for the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy" -, the liberals answer, which see only PR in it. </seg>
<seg id="28">Because in their opinion Islamization of the Constitution happens through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="29">The, they indicate especially, on article 220 which grants to the university Al-Azkhar the consultative role in particular in the fact that concern a checkup of correspondence of laws to Shariat. </seg>
<seg id="30">According to the words of the specialist in Egypt, the, the it calls worry, volume to "the people, decisions, called to receive Sophia Pom'e, not elected and haven't any democratic legitimacy". </seg>
<seg id="31">We can observe germination of theocracy". </seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals besides that are shaken up by the fact that, it will seem, the next rector of this university will be where less moderate than present. </seg>
<seg id="33">"There at the present moment is no particular religious intervention. </seg>
<seg id="34">We remain with this constitution within the framework of civil right. </seg>
<seg id="35">The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text, - *BE* this not ulemy, but the people are with university formation, some studied at a French system" - Aleksis Bloe calms which prepares a thesis on an Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="36">But he recognizes that "ambiguity can arise around the article 220 for the terms, used for it, are borrowed from a religious lexicon. </seg>
<seg id="37">It relates "to fikkh" (the divas in particular Islamic jurisprudence - the ed.). </seg>
<seg id="38">And a question, as far as the civil judges are comparable, to make the decisions on it can arise in the future". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Besides its religious aspect, the text accepted yesterday is subject to criticism, since she gives the wide authorities to the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="40">Brothers-Muslims assert that they have significantly reduced in comparison with which was at an old mode. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The other questionable moment: the authority of the army. </seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the servicemen's wishes consideration of the defense budget will take place not in the Parliament, but in the National council of defense. </seg>
<seg id="43">A court of the civil faces in the military courts, notwithstanding requests of the associations in the protection of human rights won't be also forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="44">The last have also expressed concern with the text which they believe ruinous for freedom. </seg>
<seg id="45">Responsibility for blasphemy is saved, and the insult, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, also especially for freedom of the press, is henceforth forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="46">Besides that not one of the articles is more say about the protection of a woman, Kheba Moraef from Kh'yuman Rajts Votch underlines. </seg>
<seg id="47">According to its words the ban on the tortures in the article 36 by the sole positive moment shows. </seg>
<seg id="48">The word which didn't appear in the previous Constitution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president had to act yesterday as an evening in television manifestations are planned today in the second half of day. </seg>

<seg id="17">And before the law has entered into force, many times have here the human rights activists had time to ask a question: and that, properly speaking, it will give in a press? </seg>
<seg id="18">What will change obligatoriness of knowledge of a language for both the Russians and the newcomers themselves? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Primarily - the representatives of a migratory service - answer that it will allow decreasing of the number of people, suffering "from labour slavery". </seg>
<seg id="20">Very many speak the protection of the labour migrants' rights, the head of the representation of the federal migration service of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev explains, now. </seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights must begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="22">Only the system of an organized set will allow on 90 % solving of the foreign workers' problems. </seg>
<seg id="23">The problems appear at the migrants without a profession, education, not knowing a language, not having medical examination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding of a language -, Sebelev - is sure, the future migrant is doomed to collide with the unconscientious people who under the kind of help will stick in him "to a voucher" to an eery tight hut where it and tens of similar to it will languish the months without food and the documents sticking 12-14 hours per twenty four hours each. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive a set of the complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="26">"At home him one, is promised and over arrival deceives them, selects the passports, doesn't pay salary - to promised", the head of the Main directorate of labour migration MS Tajikistan confirms Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">nasyal'nika don't swear! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, as long as many citizens of the central Asia republics, being going on salaries to Russia, confess that, a language of the country, into which but on own strive not only isn't known, is written with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is their not so much guilt, as is trouble: few Turkmenians, the Uzbeks, the Tadjiks can allow itself to receive even the intelligent initial education. </seg>
<seg id="30">However with their families one has nothing to even feed the children with not speaking already the fact to decently dress them, shoe and equip to a school. </seg>
<seg id="31">Growing to adolescent age such children at the first possibility depart on salaries. </seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of a language -, they confess. </seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel like humiliated and invalid". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">True with respect to a law of a language the human rights activists note one important moment. </seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="36">If there is - no status neither the examination nor subsequent official work will be. </seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime the immigrant workers' large part, as before, lives in Russia illegally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or an entrance to the Outsiders prohibited" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the newcomers assert that to receive an official status in our country is not so simple. </seg>
<seg id="40">The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and the still same language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="41">Besides the legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles. </seg>
<seg id="42">And it is possible to make the here false registration quickly and only in one and a half thousand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that we in the main thing have the false documents, there is no registration, hence also the cases of extortion are. </seg>
<seg id="44">"Hundred, two is asked on the cigarettes, tea" -, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov has shared with the journalists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Crash, don't begrudge, buy painting" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of entry into the force of law of a language it turned out that not the only migrantskie documents about a registration could be false. </seg>
<seg id="47">Several "lime-tree" certificates about a pass of the language tests are withdrawn by the employees of the federal migration service already. </seg>
<seg id="48">The false papers are printed on a common coloured printer. </seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners each of the migrants that were hoping in such a way to facilitate themselves a task of a pass of the tests has paid seven thousand roubles for a document haven't got them free:. </seg>
<seg id="50">It is by a factor of two-odd more expensive than the procedure of officially testing: she will cost the labour migrant to three thousand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In the fact that the main task for the near future - protect a system against corruption, so that it is impossible just to buy "the crusts" both the representatives of the power and the human rights activists converge. </seg>
<seg id="52">So far the authorities can promise to the immigrant workers that haven't managed successfully to pass testing from the first time, the time of study of the basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="53">Work in spheres, not supposing active communication with the people, will be proposed to the, besides that newcomers not knowing a Russian. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In this day some employees of the corporation of Walmart in which from the whole world 2,2 million people work abandoned their work places and picketed the shops of a corporation whose goods raschitan on the people of modest and middle sufficiency together with the trade unions and the left activists. </seg>

<seg id="12">Products in its shops on the average from 8 % to 27 % are cheaper than in the large supermarkets. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="40">They also required that in a sphere of quick supply the trade-union organizations had been created. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The American law forbids to an administration to obstruct it and punish the activists of trade-union movement with cavils and dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand the administration seldom facilitates them life. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="49">As New York Times have characterized having happened it was the largest share of such a kind in the history of an American sphere of quick supply. </seg>
<seg id="50">But in her participated only several hundreds of people, in which besides far not all of them were the employees of quick public catering borrowed, there are tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>

<seg id="10">The, for example prefix of Xbox and sensors Kinect is step ahead, and Xbox esteem not one today, without Kinect don't sell oneself for the gestural control is everything interesting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">-What else expects us ahead? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">-Notwithstanding the fact that Kinect has transfered interaction on the physical level hitherto happen on the plane screen, occasionally much into 3D. </seg>
<seg id="13">A withdrawal input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and so far not very. </seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change it, we work on the truly three-dimensional systems of reflection in a base of different technologies, including of projective. </seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to let out the computer world into us, physical, make him more palpable. </seg>
<seg id="16">It is however necessary for it to recognize not only a user, but space around him. </seg>
<seg id="17">Then we shall be able to supplement the real world with the virtual objects in a much more comfortable form. </seg>
<seg id="18">And primarily - to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">-What do you think about the vocal control? </seg>
<seg id="20">A popular piece, but isn't she overestimated? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">-Definitely to name him panacea - a question of privacy stands because one not always wants to notify others about the actions and intentions is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="22">In fact all kinds of interaction with the computers are good, but each in their niche. </seg>
<seg id="23">For example for the control of the devices in the public places we had the project in the frames of which we thought about gestures, but not sweeping, but so stingy, short. </seg>
<seg id="24">In this case gestures were removed not to a chamber of the device, but the wrist bracelet which fixed movements of the bones and the muscles. </seg>
<seg id="25">As long as he is large, but theoretically to reduce him to the size of the wrist hours is possible. </seg>
<seg id="26">But in general the future rests with mixed type of the control, for example zhest+golos. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">-It as? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">-For example as will you ask me to convey this jar of fizzy water to you? </seg>
<seg id="29">You will say and you simultaneously will show. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">-I usually just speak. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">-It on this will be very complicated to recognize. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">-Do i.e. you want to make the users adapt oneself what can, or cannot the machine for a given moment? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">-This reciprocally drawing together, but is quite optional. </seg>
<seg id="34">I think, in the near future we in the main thing shall have to work on the development of new types of the sensors which will allow more precisely defining of the person's reactions. </seg>
<seg id="35">It can be the, for example laser sensors, they give quite good permission in depth, it is very important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">-If one speaks your work on the sensors Xbox you have the which is Kinect complaints about the modern chambers? </seg>
<seg id="37">Isn't there enough resolution, depth or else anything? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The present generation - is in a principle one, is to to which possible push off in our work on three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, well obtain mega pixels by 8 with speed 1000 to/ of the sec.. </seg>
<seg id="40">But an affair not in mega pixels, and as a matrix also the depth themselves. </seg>
<seg id="41">From the last viewpoint all present technologies are us insufficiently good - it adds works for the designers of the algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="42">It is i.e. necessary to remember not only about Z permission over the axes X and Y, but. </seg>
<seg id="43">The speed of the number of frames per second is also very important. </seg>
<seg id="44">Enough for the person's movement is dynamic, and the present 30 to/, it from is frankly a bit too small especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Betishes from our Redmondskoj laboratory has made a sensor of touch the adjusted delay of treatment - from 1 to 100 ms, and the modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) index. </seg>
<seg id="46">Not everybody understands to what extent it influences interaction between a person and the machines. </seg>
<seg id="47">The equivalent of such a device, only not requiring touches that the frames per second were more, in my work would prove useful to me very much. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">-And to increase the number of chambers is not necessary? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">-Into Kinect now is, of which three "cameras", are one in fact - the infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of a reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="50">And the here already third chamber -, properly speaking, is a common sensor of visible range. </seg>
<seg id="51">She doesn't apply for definition of the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="52">The potentially *greater* number of chambers would be able to solve a problem… </seg>
<seg id="53">Or aggravate her increasing the necessary volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="54">It would be quite good to create flexible analog Kinect, poigrat'sya with curvature, how it will help to see, dispositions of the chambers and in three-dimensional definition of a position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">-The as far as I remember, to Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present public my spectacles. </seg>
<seg id="56">Doesn't it seem that from a viewpoint of everyday use of technologies of supplemented reality the spectacles are one of the most promising platforms to you? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">-I think: the, of course, all time to wake up holding a smartphone in the raised arms not very comfortably, but here what "passing" supplemented reality would be when on the basis of the cloudy platform you would be able to switch from the spectacles to a smartphone, projective display also further everywhere the steepest version. </seg>
<seg id="58">The spectacles - very personal arrangement, their in it force (only you see the private things) and simultaneously the weakness - supplemented reality on the basis of the spectacles won't allow you to work on the virtual objects jointly with other people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">-We shall imagine for a minute that the manipulation with the virtual holographic objects in air is accessible not only to Tony Starku from "the Iron Person", but a simple mortal. </seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem on which the critics of such often indicate are ideas: there is no tactile recall! </seg>
<seg id="61">The arms don't feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="62">What answers does your group prepare on this call? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">-In my lectures I often say that the supplemented reality is the seventh breakthrough in succession in interaction between a person and a machine. </seg>
<seg id="64">The I think eighth addition of the tactile feelings quite can become. </seg>
<seg id="65">So far one of the interesting tricks is use of the second arm as a peculiar undercoat for an image. </seg>
<seg id="66">She excellently registers pressing! </seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies which indeed are directed on addition "to here these pictures in air" of tangibility -, for example the interference of several directional ultrasound rays in a definite point where the finger, is, a feeling, gives, but so far it is very weak - like to you have blown on the hassocks. </seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets on the wrists which influence for nervous completions in the fingers - the too promising direction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">-And did you try to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="70">To make him think that he feels the fact that, does it seem, have to feel at that moment, when it sees anything? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">-Here it is good idea, we haven't tasted yet to so make. </seg>
<seg id="72">Here lurks one more task one over which is in for fighting else long - how make a person, physically being in very limited space, come to believe that he walks over open, practically infinite - we work and over the concepts of race tracks (quite not such as in the clubs), the moving platforms, as well as the huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="73">As long as deceive the brain turns out so-so works, more very for many years. </seg>
<seg id="74">Here what does the work on virtual reality of such, attractive to a researcher - many things in the absolutely rudimentary state. </seg>

<seg id="6">The pictures of Kirill Miller always gather the crowds of the spectators where they wouldn't expose themselves. </seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of the particularly Petersburg social-philosophic tale-tellers, the creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller - it is a bright person of Petersburg vanguard of the end of the 80th is beginnings of the 90th. </seg>
<seg id="9">Besides that he is a person of the city, by his appearance in the streets evoking smile at the townspeople, raising all mood. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> -Kirill, and why do you nevertheless go around the city in everything red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> -I have chosen red colour as a designer, dealing with the kind and an image. </seg>
<seg id="13">In this world red colour is compromise between the artist, imidzhmejkerom and a society. </seg>
<seg id="14">Although there is everything that is slightly not gray in the society cause aggression and excitation of an unkind property. </seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are directed on the fact that a talk has begun. </seg>
<seg id="16">The whole history of my provocative actions is invitation to discussion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> -And when you understood that you must be an artist? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> -On exhibition in the club Neva where my works were exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="19">I have understood that it is my way. </seg>
<seg id="20">Then the wave of the old free unofficial artists passed, and, new, free a fellow me true stories are unclear. </seg>
<seg id="21">I have begun to be on the friendly terms with with the artists of the new wave, from postgazonevshchinoj which has brought to "Pushkin-,the 10", also larger wave wasn't. </seg>
<seg id="22">I throw to a theatre, the clothes, music, into all genres, except a word. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> -And all of it has united in your Art clinic… - it was important for Me to find oneself at the center of culture of Petersburg where all the best creative forces must gather. </seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995 I occupied the territory, on Pushkin-10, and there, as long as repair, wasn't existed the musical-artistic club, the Bohemian club, the house of Petersburg Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="25">Many there were: born the nomes, I remember, as a Cord have brought Tekila jazz with the project "van Gogh's Ear". </seg>
<seg id="26">The cord and his friends sang easy songs under plywood, they were in covering the pants, there was fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin among them. </seg>
<seg id="27">When the group began to play *alive* she has become "Leningrad". </seg>
<seg id="28">Trakhtenberg was a host of many programmes before khali-galivskikh times. </seg>
<seg id="29">We have given Trakhtenberga to them, and his great career, has gone, and the basic education and upbringing he has received from us. </seg>
<seg id="30">A gallery "D. 137", the club "Griboedov is aftersounds from Art-a clinic. </seg>
<seg id="31">There our employees and the haunters have gone away. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="33">The polling was in 2000 in the press, the prize was "the People of our city". </seg>
<seg id="34">In nomination "Artist of the year" I was named, my culmination has ended. </seg>
<seg id="35">To work, I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the last century, in new times over the old rules is comfortless. </seg>
<seg id="36">In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity divide, it is possible to be popular, but not very cultural. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> -A recognizable fashion is inherent in your works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> -Many my pictures are the hits, relevance, by them brightly expressed, and is sharpness. </seg>
<seg id="39">I shall have programme exhibition, "the Russian museum in the clowns". </seg>
<seg id="40">The clowns are timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="41">I earlier was social, now to be such - it is sick is also fearful. </seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clowns everything gets smeared, the tragism films. </seg>
<seg id="43">I like grotesque, I have sanserif ideas. </seg>
<seg id="44">For example rescue of the world by a totalitarian disguise in the order order. </seg>
<seg id="45">Over *clothes* is now met orientating oneself to external mechanics, and not an internal person. </seg>
<seg id="46">And, maybe, to to him give the hand is impossible and to into erysipelas spit is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47">And the deception will be removed with the help of a disguise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> -And we have recently seen you in a role of an urban organgrinder - the Cultural city must have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="49">Who as not me, them must be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> -Well can, and can the commercial art be beautiful? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> -Now commercial art must be accurate, tactful sweet course. </seg>
<seg id="52">Disintegration of cultures takes place. </seg>
<seg id="53">The people were earlier beaten at the flocks, Bohemia liked, one, the simpletons, are other. </seg>
<seg id="54">Everybody has now broken into the micro communities, now everybody with difficulty will like. </seg>
<seg id="55">I am not one hundred dollar scrap of paper to please everybody. </seg>
<seg id="56">It now is necessary to think whom will please. </seg>
<seg id="57">100 admirers' now at each cult hero each. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> -And Stasa Mikhaylov comes on in several thousand! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> -On him come broshenki, there sex-social sphere works. </seg>
<seg id="60">And on cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 thousand won't come, and there is a less management, money, everything withers away in the total. </seg>
<seg id="61">I have the admirers, it is the main thing not to deceive them, not spoil acquired. </seg>
<seg id="62">I in adolescence painted such pictures that they hung the wall next to Falck and Larionov at one collector. </seg>
<seg id="63">I have begun with the pictures in which is usually finished. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Notions are often now confounded. </seg>
<seg id="65">Spiritual culture, culture of consumption are told:. </seg>
<seg id="66">No culture is, at consumption, it from the other opera. </seg>
<seg id="67">I am a person of yesterday culture, have grown on the examples of the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, declined money for the sake of drawing of the pictures. </seg>
<seg id="68">I am for such here a culture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> -Kirill, enough what for Petersburg there isn't? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> -The good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="71">There is such a notion: the official from culture. </seg>
<seg id="72">But not each of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="73">With the correct Tsars everything not so was, reign maybe, wasn't understood in culture very much, but they understood that it was necessary to hold the correct experts. </seg>
<seg id="74">Now there are the good counselors here in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="75">With us in Petersburg the people are, which could to be the experts, but they shut, for the higher experts who correctly will estimate these experts and will give a road to them are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="76">Now vkusovshchinka prospers. </seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but distinguish them, other museums who they honestly say that we receive not the whole modern art are such artists must look for ourselves for the fact that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> -What such for you is Petersburg? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> -Petersburg is not the cultural capital, in Moscow cultures are much larger, there soil is. </seg>
<seg id="80">And the on our stones art grow finds it hard. </seg>
<seg id="81">Cultural soil is for us necessary, and with us the writers now are more than the readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="82">Which here in Europe many asking people go on exhibitions, the concerts very much. </seg>
<seg id="83">With us this layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="84">It is for us necessary to make fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A head of the Main test-revisional control: the Checkup of the Schwarz system has fallen through over the politicians' guilt. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In a branch of the state purchases Czechia has the good organs of the control and, notwithstanding the presence of quality legislation at its disposal, lags behind its application. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This declaration of *Miroslav* of *FAECES*, the vice-president of the supreme test-revisional administration from an interview for the site Aktualne.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be ideal, but it must correctly, in my opinion there isn't - enough for us which, has commented on the current situation of *FAECES*, apply". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Joint inspection of the Czech and German organs of the control grants the similar conclusions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">An approach of Peter Nechasa to the so named Schwarz system as an example of wrong practice is led. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Has recently the prime minister declared, what GDP (the Civil democratic party) won't worry the businessmen with the checkups - it goes out forbidden or resolved? </seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be in any set way, and if it forbids, anything then also the prime minister cannot oppose to the work of the institutions, to which is imputed duty to check and demand execution of obligations" - state, *FAECES*. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At a session of the revisional committee in the deputies' Chamber you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German sides in the frames of which the legislation on the state purchases of both countries was juxtaposed. </seg>
<seg id="10">About what specifically did the matter concern? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is meant that the parallel checkup which we have begun probably, two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="12">More simply speaking, about the fact that European legislation asserts speech, in what way have to study, the state purchases, are further, also an application in practice follows national legislation and afterwards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The whole information was acquired also even in an else unfinished checkup, have transpired interesting differences - more simply speaking the legislation with us can be "the precise and unerring", however in a practician of an application we in some parameters are inferior to Germany. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows that it is insufficient to create still more, and more are the precised rules, it is necessary to concentrate on an application of law itself it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And can the properly how given project help you, what does he mean for you? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such a joint control can make a contribution to the efforts in a stop of rectification of laws, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it doesn't lead to positive result. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy means reception of a proper thing for fair (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and, perhaps, criminal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="18">But it is not the fact that we shall reach it decreasing a restriction on the orders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps this system will overflow "the papers" so that ones who will wish to find loop-holes in a given system will find them much lighter than if the restriction hasn't gone down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You speak the internal problems of a practical application of legislation on the state purchases. </seg>
<seg id="21">And how does the system of the control in Germany function? </seg>
<seg id="22">Does such an organization as us of Crewe (the Test-revisional control) exist there, or does it work otherwise? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What concerns the institutions one there acts as as our Crewe, Bundesrechnungshof, is made according to our principle, the board, working a little differently, also exists, but in the main thing both institutions function similarly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Besides that the authorities are before the definite degree similar, but there since Germany has a federal structure, one there are subdivisions of an audit and at the level of the federal lands - in it their system somewhat differs from us. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can control only federal money, we have state means at our disposal. </seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds in our regions and the municipalities are monitored at the level of the federal audit chambers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What concerns local legislation there more simply than at us? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general I wouldn't want to compare without particular data, but in some relation to take Germany behind a sample, but it is impossible to definitely say that it is better in everything is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Is it so, because they better cope with the control? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely isn't, but I shall be repeated, similar to me comparisons don't please. </seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to say that even the exemplary countries face many problems. </seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise wouldn't they gain any advantage from cooperation with our office probably? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If speak internal legislation then how has one been reflected on your institution of a correction of a Law of the state purchases, in any way are consequences manifested? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Taking into account that the legal force of these corrections is enough short she in any way yet hasn't been manifested in our works on the control. </seg>
<seg id="35">For we conduct the control over a fact it is necessary to take some delay into account. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We take it into account only in a process of preparation of the future checkups - we have begun to use our new instrument "detection of unthrift risk" across which we have passed almost 14000 state contracts We have analyzed them There, of course, these changes will be manifested, because the restrictions, change, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on vary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">How do you count the assertion this law will bring benefit or the additional load of a system of a bureaucracy? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law certainly is step in a correct direction, and, I hope, it will be confirmed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem which can arise is such that the rules "will toughen", and it will be impossible to observe them. </seg>
<seg id="40">The enterprises, in functioning of the previous rules monitored, are bound with a supplier (for example, the regional operative programmes - with regional advice) in the fact that any nonobservance of a law of the state purchases means violation of budget discipline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Stand in such an opportunity to toughen a law in such a way? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">What I think in not this way. </seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude ones who want to capture and abuse, but not punish ones who make a formal mistake, not influencing a solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system only will create the some more *greater* pressure on a bureaucracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And whereas go out from this situation? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let us realize that this way nowhere won't bring. </seg>
<seg id="47">Has recently the prime minister declared that GDP won't worry the businessmen with the checkups of the so named Schwarz system, What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="48">Is "the Schwarz system" forbidden or resolved? </seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be in any set way, and if it forbids, anything then also the prime minister cannot oppose to the work of the organs to which is imputed duty to check and demand execution of obligations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is possible to say: "We shall change this law and we shall resolve it", but it is impossible to say that will pretend, as if nothing happened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law of the state purchases contains the enough obligatory rules as also what must be formally conducted, and it, correctly It will protect the state purchases. </seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of the formal shortcomings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be ideal, but it must correctly, in my opinion there isn't enough for us which, apply. </seg>

<seg id="1">Shimon Ornest: On the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about the fact that the end of light must begin less than in a month? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It-is only one of the many alarming news, on which we, the people, so easily *come_across*. </seg>
<seg id="4">Together with a group of The Tap Tap we permanently joke on this theme and we say that we are the sole group in the world which will be able to assemble sufficiently positive energy to defer or prevent the end of light. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">More than that in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts are against the end of light. </seg>
<seg id="6">Would you be able more in more detail to tell about it the readers? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The matter concerns about the nationwide action of collection of means which we plan here already during two years. </seg>
<seg id="8">We have decided to use the marketing potential which a calendar of the Maya on the end of which announced on 21 December into 11: 10 possesses. </seg>
<seg id="9">In a day before this event, the 20th December in 21: 00 three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava parallelly start. </seg>
<seg id="10">They will end, roughly speaking, at that moment, when there is an hourly zone of which on the island of *Kiribati* in the Pacific ocean, 12 hours earlier than at us, the May calendar will finish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">For whom has this idea come to the head? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Primordially it was my idea, we further invented everything together with our artist Gonzoj Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="13">Besides the fact that we want to accumulate sufficiently positive energy and prevent the end of light we also want together with a community to think over in what state we once shall convey this world to our children. </seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of completion of the May calendar we have created unique collection of the items the footwear, the sport shirts, the bags and the original keys against the end of light, to buy These things on the site www.e-tap.cz and by that together show a support to us is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group of The Tap Tap has together with other musicians also executed anthem against the end of the light which is called "the End of light is canceled". </seg>
<seg id="16">Will sound the anthem on these benefit performance concerts, having already liked the listeners YouTube? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, at the very end if in a total everything turns out, and the end of light won't begin. </seg>
<seg id="18">All performers on all concerts will begin to sing him simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="19">Anthems simultaneously will sound also in live broadcast of Czech television. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The words to this song has written and has played Jesus' role in a clip Tomasz Ganak, X participate in execution also of Xindl… </seg>
<seg id="21">How have you begun to cooperate with them? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life, since we take many charitable actions and the concerts. </seg>
<seg id="23">We try actively to switch them to these projects. </seg>
<seg id="24">It has turned out that many like with us to work, are interesting to them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On what help from a concert against the end of light will go? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On a purchase of the equipment bezbar'ernogo the educational center STUDEO, the already sixth year we so work with civil union Tap in Edlichki institute. </seg>
<seg id="27">The teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of Edlichki institute and take cheerful and interesting actions with them. </seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves haven't means to depart to the teachers, and we try in such a way to grant this possibility to them. </seg>
<seg id="29">The building into which we shall move with this project within the framework of the project of an additional construction of Edlichki institute will arise separately in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On each concert several musical groups and the performers will come forward. </seg>
<seg id="31">What were criteria for selection? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to be the programme which will attract all generations of including the children. </seg>
<seg id="33">For example in Prague will appear Chinaski Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere from Danom *Bart* The Tap Tap, Mar'yan Bango and Irzhi is Dry. </seg>
<seg id="34">To all details find out on the site www.kpks cz is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Do you plan any similar "grandiose actions" in the future? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May will appear for the first time on festival "Prague spring" and we here, of course, shall prepare an interesting programme with the interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="37">In the next year we with pleasure would give performance in a Czech national house in New York, and I personally, already if we are in the USA, would want to appear in Washington and Chicago very much. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About the foreign countries with you the serious plans, you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="39">The group of The Tap Tap is a group of the people with the limited possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="40">How do you cope with a road from a viewpoint of the organization and logistics?? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not so fearful, as seems on the first glance. </seg>
<seg id="42">With us five participants on the electric invalid carriages, their carriages must journey in the baggage section, in addition of everything are the large quantity of the cargo and the boxes with the instruments. </seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, as long as the Czech airlines CSA coped with it without the problems, and British airlines British Airways always perfectly are prepared for true story for us what me how much once amazed. </seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow from where we have recently returned everything went without the problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Due to departures abroad you can compare the different countries from a viewpoint of availability, the attitude of the community to the invalids and so on. </seg>
<seg id="46">What did you face to the present moment? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxemburg, London and other countries where everything functions better than at us, in Russia we have become the witnesses of the fact that in the east everything else is at the basic level. </seg>
<seg id="48">The independent movement of the person on an electric invalid carriage at the center of the city in comparison with Prague in Moscow, very many barriers, are also here still is into wonder some more. </seg>
<seg id="49">Not in run such banal things as concede a road to an invalid in a lift are also there. </seg>
<seg id="50">The public organizations which try to pay attention of the people to the problems of the people of the limited possibilities fortunately arise also there already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And with what, permanently must conversely we catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Very many things is the level of execution of which far behind are. </seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to precise that the improvement and the improvement of a situation always depend on the efforts of those people whom it concerns. </seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is quite normal that the people with a heavy form of disability independently move in the streets, can come down to a toilet, to a museum, yes where *please*… </seg>
<seg id="55">The fact that the large number of people with the limited possibilities takes active part in public life, we outpace them with The Tap Tap a little it there is not very widespread! </seg>
<seg id="56">Respect to a community or bezbar'ernost' is one thing, but at a moment, when among us will appear the known sportsmen, the artists, the actors, the politicians or the lawyers, then everything also really will begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="57">As long as it is the unitary cases - the people with strong will. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group of The Tap Tap currently is very popular, but shall we return for two years back, what in 1998 made you organize her? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I have entered Edlichki institute as an educator, there were many young people who wanted to start to deal with something around me. </seg>
<seg id="60">And since me the musician himself and I play including and on a saxophone, the interesting musical circlet has together with a colleague organized that. </seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and with the time, as our host speaks, Making ready this Angelovich, a little have got out of the control (laugh). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Did the popularity come only in the last years, or do I confound anything? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is truth, the fact that we have begun to join the famous singers and actively work on a propaganda of a group has helped us. </seg>
<seg id="64">We have drawn a conclusion that the work which nobody can estimate in essence like exists. </seg>
<seg id="65">Due to means for the European union we can allow ourselves the skilled teachers, the equipment and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Did the aim so well to promote The Tap Tap face you? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the very beginning I felt their potential in an ability to make something unusual. </seg>
<seg id="68">In Shaw-business is full of augural, imitating each other. </seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical, everything new begins with caution, and lasts for it long. </seg>
<seg id="70">Very few rare things, but I shall dare to say that Tap Tap is alone exist from them. </seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression with the person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural… </seg>
<seg id="72">But this pity is perfectly excessive, because the people with the limited possibilities don't appear any suffering and all abandoned personalities which we must grudge. </seg>
<seg id="73">They are the people who can live full-fledged life and develop, of course, only provided they possess the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if the people with disability something can it is shift not only for them, but for the whole society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Has the fact that you are the strict leader to which you many believe insured success? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do work qualitatively we must be in many things uncompromising and hold definite discipline. </seg>
<seg id="77">But I believe that it is normal. </seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic presentation and fly in the clouds, and when it is found, out that two times per week are they have to go on rehearsals to attend preparatory courses and spend much time in a road, the enthusiasm is very quickly lost. </seg>
<seg id="79">But so happen in any group which wants to work and reach something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">The current in composition of the group of The Tap Tap 20 people. </seg>
<seg id="81">How much they were at the beginning in 1998? </seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and space. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week at a session of the ministers of the European space agency Poland was received by the twentieth member of the European space agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern block (after Czechia which became a full-fledged member of the European Space Agency on 12 September 2008). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland has begun close cooperation with the European Space Agency in 1994 and during the subsequent years has taken active part in the row of the projects of an agency. </seg>
<seg id="4">But Poland has begun the way to space much earlier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Before the Second world war yet the Polish enthusiasts dealt with the trips to space, but not always it met understanding. </seg>
<seg id="6">I shall resemble, for example about a lecture by A.. Sternfeld who on 6 December 1933 represented in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from my innovative work "Introduction astronautics". </seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of a young engineer (the yr 1905 of river) have left an audience for indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recollected that only doctor Jan Gadomskij had been interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="8">In the year 1934 in France Sternfeld won a prize of Robert Esno-Pel'tri and Andre Louis Khirsha for "Introduction astronautics". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Doctor Jan Gadomskij (1899 - 1966) about whom was told higher has later become the great propagandist of astronomy and astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="10">He has published hundreds of articles in the Polish magazines and has written the row of the books, dedicated by it to scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskij has become the known world propagandist of astronautics, and his contribution was estimated including by the fact that one of the craters on a reverse side of the Moon was named in its honour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in the year 1925 in Poland the railway railcar, equipped with the rocket engine, was built. </seg>
<seg id="13">Regretfully the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as also a detail on the project. </seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear whether even, for acceleration or for braking of a wagon the rocket had to be used. </seg>
<seg id="15">Information on this railcar is known only from the press of that epoch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Polish artillery has begun with 1933 to ponder the rocket arrows. </seg>
<seg id="17">The Section on technique of armament in cooperation with professors Mechislavom Vol'fke and Gustavus Mokzhitskim realized investigation. </seg>
<seg id="18">One from the materials that have remained can see that investigations have reached before the stage of the practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="19">But with coming of the German troops works were interrupted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The idea of the photo-electric rocket-destroyer which the *Rogozin* engineer has proposed, and in the next year the work "the Air rocket-torpedo and the aviation rocket-bomb" of author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotskogo went out in 1937 appeared in specialized print. </seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use of the rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="22">The Temporary scientific-consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated the whole work before war itself dealt with all projects of military use of rocket engineering. </seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was formed in 1937, but the work has ended after two years of its activity because of the beginning of war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work, dedicated to astronautics, appeared in the Polish press after a war, due to the work of the Polish society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="25">1954 years of the magazine "of a Problem" in which four volumetric articles on astronautics are published for the first time are mentioned in November number about a society. </seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them professor M Subotovich has proposed to found the society which will deal with astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="27">In that time the projects of the artificial satellites already grew, and it was clear that space investigations were a promising branch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of astronautics (POA) tried to enter the international federation of astronautics (based in 1951), and in already autumn POA became her actual member. </seg>
<seg id="29">And in the next year the first chairman POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became a deputy of the chairman of the International federation of astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="30">He remained on this job before most his death which has come in 1959. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since the year 1956 POA have made a significant contribution to the development of the tremendously successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which has become the first Polish rocket that has executed scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launching has taken place 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 metres, was into the length about 80 centimetres, and its weight equalled less than 5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="34">Hereafter the improved version RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 the tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were given on the Bledovskom vacant plot. </seg>
<seg id="35">This rocket was into the length about 1,4 metres, and its weight equalled about 11,5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the rocket was even able to do the present scientific work - the rocket RM-34 could overcome 14,5 kilometres, and observation of the high altitude wind was its task. </seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962 farther development was suspended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">A rocket Meteor-1, developed in a period between 1962 and 1965 years, has become the heiress of the first rockets of type RM. </seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as two-stage, its common length equalled 510 centimetres, and the initial weight is 32,5 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="40">Three types, (designated as a Meteor-,1A 1V and-1S) which differed in the size of the chamber for the scientific equipment were developed. </seg>
<seg id="41">The rocket Meteor-1A had space of the volume of 0,4 liters at its disposal, the Meteor-1V is 0,34 liters, and the Meteor-1S - 0 62l. </seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range of the flight at all three types was 37 kilometres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In a period between 1965 and 1968 the years in the Aviation institute took place the development of a rocket Meteor-2, and its first flying tests have begun in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="44">The rocket Meteor-2 with the starting weight of 380 kilograms was capable of deducing a useful cargo of the weight 10 kilograms on the height about 60 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="45">Then the versions Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is worth mentioning also about entry of Poland into KOSPAR (the Committee for space investigations) in the year 1960 and creation of the national committee KOSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="47">Besides that there is Inter space within the framework of the programme, Poland participated in investigations to space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot *Miroslav* Germashevskij became the second inter astronaut after Vladimir Remeka. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The cancellation of a law of public works is not a solution of a problem. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week the constitutional court annuled a law of public works. </seg>
<seg id="3">The decree has caused lively discussion in a society. </seg>
<seg id="4">It surely will be interesting to glance at given problem range from a wider viewpoint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberally-oriented economic systems in EU also as also in the globalized world are based on the principle of a plural, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="6">In essence it means that the separate economic subdivisions, the national economic systems are in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="7">It is connected with the principle of free trade and movement, to free anything not restricted, of the private capital together with ungovernable financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="8">Price tension arises as a result of considerable difference in the cost of the workforce (salary). </seg>
<seg id="9">Is by this notion necessary to understand state, when the producer by delivery of cheap goods tries to withstand in an economic competition by the fact that the competitor's cost "knocks down" with aim to take away oneself the large part of a market and, thus, increase the own income. </seg>
<seg id="10">Either the transfer of production abroad, or the cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance As a result increases, the unemployment in ones in the countries, where, in comparison with other, the cost of the workforce, is is high in the mass scale means it for the businessmen's majority. </seg>
<seg id="11">Since the private capital doesn't bear any social responsibility, including and behind produced by him unemployment unavoidable expenses of the state for social needs grow. </seg>
<seg id="12">On the whole the situation reinforces unwillingness of Messr businessmen to pay taxes and with that *MOST* compensate public economic and social damage, caused them in a chase of profit. </seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give particular statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="14">The unceremonious methods of the private capital create at the level of economies of the separate states of the situation, when the governments of the countries are forced enter a competition with each other to artificially decrease the social level of their population with a view on drawing in to a country of the foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="15">In other words the governments give back the own population on the tyranny to the private capital notwithstanding social degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="16">It finds its reflection primarily in the changes of active legislation. </seg>
<seg id="17">By aim own appears to economically make ??narod be subordinated to dictation of the private capital primarily in the region of salary. </seg>
<seg id="18">It acts as a system of economic coercion in a case of prolonged unemployment and in the same time serves as an instrument for cutdown of rights of the employees in a sphere of labour legislation. </seg>
<seg id="19">As a result, the level of poverty, and also the difference between the poor and rich increase together from by that. </seg>
<seg id="20">Public distribution of products over the poor which are not able to support itself by own labour exists already several years in the Federal Republic of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people approaches a million already. </seg>
<seg id="22">The cases, when the people, placed in a job, earn such a salary that the state must pay to them so that they receive the subsistence minimum permanently happen within the framework of an increase of competitivity of German economy. </seg>
<seg id="23">The similar scandal has become known to a community also in a case of the additional employees of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="24">The economic measures practically in all southern states of EU, surely, in which results to the same state the people, being under the pressure of catastrophic fall of the social status forced or to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or exist on the backyards of the society in hope on beggarly salary what ever will come to the country, are private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="25">Is however asked from where he will originate? </seg>
<seg id="26">If the capital comes from other countries of EU then poverty to move from one country into other, or he won't come in general, for a Chinese, the Hindu, the Brazilian, the Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still work any more for a share of European salary. </seg>
<seg id="27">It concerns the whole Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and the mass media before nausea assert that the state cannot participate in the capital of own economy that the controllable economy conducts to an economic catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital steadily insists on the fact that the state must not with actions be mixed up by the managers with economy. </seg>
<seg id="30">Is it necessary to answer with a question whether the private capital, now practically the manager don't act policy and of the themes most the entire state in own selfish aims further? </seg>
<seg id="31">Unambiguous answer - yes. </seg>
<seg id="32">Existence of the practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states is the proof. </seg>
<seg id="33">As result we have a hopeless situation, being manifested in corruption, the support of reciprocal profits, legislation where practically everything deserves punishment, however isn't crime. </seg>
<seg id="34">In the Federal Republic of Germany the situation is such that the state ministries because of a shortage of financial means entrust the private law firms which tightly are connected with an industry with the development of bills. </seg>
<seg id="35">The Bundestag afterwards asserts these bills. </seg>
<seg id="36">The whole power originates not from a people as the constitution of the western type, and from the financial-powerful groups, preferring own interests, says. </seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that the liberally-oriented democracy now quickly turns out in such ??situatsii as this, Appianom in work "the Crisis of the Roman empire in days of Caesar and Pompeii": "the State disintegrates, already for a long time, and the departments deal with violence is described. </seg>
<seg id="38">The bribes, illegal reception of mercies with the help of the stones and the swords. </seg>
<seg id="39">The bribery and the corruption prospered without the versatile bans, and the people went on an election with the beforehand sold voice"…, "the honest people in general didn't run for the ruler's job, the state has once eventually remained without a consul "Earnestly, have begun, to speak that that the sole rescue in this awful situation is, autocracy and the necessity of a choice of the energetic person", Appian thought that it would be Pompeii, but Caesar, who has finally replaced democracy with autocracy has become him, for eight months". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Own reckless interests without consideration of public interests as also in antiquity, in a modern society prevail. </seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital already in its essence isn't intended for an application in public aims. </seg>
<seg id="42">The present result doesn't differ from the past: unparalleled degeneration of the elite without any endeavour to conduct reforms of the deeper character. </seg>
<seg id="43">Mean a cause of appearance of fascist, and we must look for the communist regimes in reckless liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries. </seg>
<seg id="44">As of today it is possible the absence of these regimes and existence of democracy of liberal type to perceive the definite pause after which the next tour is expected how. </seg>
<seg id="45">The fact that the present elite completely ignores consequences into hundreds of the thousands of victims in the future the humanitarian and social catastrophes which we already now observe together with crimes are against of humaneness, how we know it from old and new history is primarily tragic. </seg>
<seg id="46">The cancellation of a law of public works isn't not a solution or at least forever. </seg>
<seg id="47">The government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for the ways for farther decrease in the social level of the population under the pressure of the competition in both international, and of the national and European levels. </seg>
<seg id="48">The tendency, by such an image given, has the system character. </seg>
<seg id="49">Special purpose political and social reforms which will allow strengthening of share participation of the state in economy, the citizens' role in the control of the state will reinforce and will loosen a monopolistic position of the private capital in a society in favour to the state are the solution. </seg>

<seg id="6">I don't want to speculate on one who is in these waves of murders - the criminal, and who, being periodically repeated, the victim, eventually, today's citizens of Israel, of including the self controllable territories, have been born for a moment of the current political situation, and wasn't the witnesses have begun violence. </seg>

<seg id="8">Some of my reasonings is confirmed with the historical facts, some of them are removed on the base of my own understanding of one, who or what group of the people *BE* the main engine of the events of modern history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of the mankind is primarily the history of struggle for the power. </seg>
<seg id="10">We can find the same Alexander Velikogo or Napoleon in each epoch. </seg>
<seg id="11">That it is not so clear whether whether always these people perfectly independently took their steps, or somebody, who directed their actions to beforehand planned aims stood behind their throne. </seg>
<seg id="12">It is necessary to assume that we live in the period, when world wealth is concentrated, and, which this concentration of money and the power, ensuing from them, couldn't, happen in several persons' arms in life of one generation. </seg>
<seg id="13">Some which could be considered as the head of the octopus, (I don't know, somebody over them, stands, but it isn't excluded) -, Rothschilds outstands among the astronomically rich families. </seg>
<seg id="14">About them isn't written much. </seg>
<seg id="15">Is understood. </seg>
<seg id="16">They bought the first agency of news (Rejters) already in the 90th years of century, 19, to stop the rumours, connecting their name with criminal actions in the highest spheres, in shadow of which they were, and which always led to consolidation of their power, an increase of wealth or simultaneously and to that, and to other. </seg>
<seg id="17">With them the large packages of the shares are almost in all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in whose central banks they haven't their share at their disposal, they lead or prepare a war (there were in all 7 countries before the intrusion Afghanistan, 5 countries, have become, remained, however in the same time the Russian government took only four after overthrow of Khaddafi, the central is a bank of their country into their arms after intrusion Iraq). </seg>
<seg id="18">Any who tried to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln has refused to keep a status of the central bank behind Rotshil'dovskim Bank of America, during a civil war he has begun to produce own own (understand - governmental) money and was killed in the year 1865 in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="20">John F. Kennedy, produce own money and wanted beginnings FED (the federal reserve system) to cancel was killed in 1963 Deputy Louis Makfadden was poisoned in the year 1936 after wanted to give to a court on FED for untying of the Great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst for the world power in a period from 1859 to 1871 years has brought to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great mason of the 33th level by Albert Pajkom. </seg>
<seg id="22">The, with a task of the first war was destruction monarchic states in Europe, the second had to destroy colonial predominance of especially Great Britain, and the third must bring to reduction of the world population approximately up to 0,5-1 of a billion people (sufficiently the support of their comfort and luxury will be the such number of slaves, and they won't consume many resources), creation of integral universal religion (the ecumenism cannot be nothing else besides as a prerequisite of such a project) and a final capture of the absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="23">A challenge of the crisis and subsequent offer of the solutions (order ab chao - the order from chaos) are the method with the help of which the group of the richest families, headed by Rothschilds, works. </seg>
<seg id="24">But these solutions are false and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the base FED which had to prevent repetition of a crisis, caused by them, in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, after they have succeeded in unleashing the First world war by the murder of the Habsburg's heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo they have destroyed Tsarist Russia beginning bolshevik revolyutsiiyu. </seg>
<seg id="26">The first world war has ended with abrupt, unfounded in military and economic relation by the capitulation of Germany (the necessity of a war for destruction of Tsarist Russia hasn't already been), breaking up with the central European state, Austro-Hungary, as consequence, has also happened. </seg>
<seg id="27">For relief of untying of the Second world war the bankers and the politicians have created a concealed uncooperative situation putting huge military reparations what to Germany, has been created a prerequisite of radicalization of masses, then, further, to create multinational Czechoslovakia with by strong German minority, which is have to was to play, and have indeed played a function of the fifth column, in kindling of a fire of war remained only toss up the Germans sufficiently having got poor strong, the convicting of culpable and proposing the Leader's simple decisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century Rothschilds provoked a base for Zionist movement, of which one branch strove, to create the Jewish state, is preferable is in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="29">The aforementioned declaration of Balfour has created a prerequisite of the Jews' mass immigration to Palestine, the first collisions with the local Arab population have begun to happen. </seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks happened from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="31">The Second world war has flashed, it is difficult to estimate whether Hitler has escaped from the chains, in which primordially the bankers, kept him, or everything, that it has done, was planned in any case of suffering of the European Jews in the concentrative camps have been created the prerequisites of recognition of the Jewish state as the world community. </seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially based in 1948 and, like that as Germany was provoked by military reparations to the 2th world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create focus of third war. </seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers succeed in untying her, the Jewish people, as also in the second world war will become a victim of the military operations on a line of the front, now already together with the Arab or, more simply speaking by the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is the like gigantic laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside a country, but at the international level (take only sharp separation of the people into the partisans and the opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty, and who is a victim in a Palestinian-Israeli conflict where the resentment causes resentment in an infinite chain of violence if everything has begun with the individuals' greed and their aspiration the world power? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It here is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because the bankers, as also at us international, fob off for the people for a voting in the election of only the own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="37">The present prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist, loyal to the international bankers, the politician, making everything to start the war with Iran which due to membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization of cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan)… will threaten to develop into the world conflict, and taking the control of Iran of the *Hormuz* strait, containing 20 % of all world reserves of petroleum (the navigable corridor is only only 2 miles by the width) -, into account also will result in destruction of world economy. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">In what light the words, said by David Rockefeller in 1994: "what is All for us necessary - it is a common crisis, and the people will receive the new world order" are now manifested. </seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their idea is a world of the gentlemen and the slaves. </seg>
<seg id="40">The world where the remaining part of the human population serves the handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort. </seg>
<seg id="41">Consecration oil where the chip with which it becomes essence, being under the total control, is implanted for each born body in birth. </seg>

<seg id="13">CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities has succeeded in taking them away from Iran, in this case has helped the extravagant legend of the cover according to which they have departed with the Canadian passports as the members of a shooting group that were looking about for a place for shooting of science fiction epic in a country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of the genres </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan which an expert "on evacuation" of Tony Mendes has invented required cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="16">So that the legend is certain, in the specialized magazines was written about the project of a film the press conferences were convened, the fictitious productional company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="17">The details on an operation stuck the long time in a secret, the film, based is on memoirs of Tony Mendesa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleka film is special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="19">An on the one hand real political thriller, the so named "film-cine opus", the history of successful contrivance, fraud - the row of the films about friends Oushena can be the example. </seg>
<seg id="20">In a film permanently vary moods - on the one hand documentary, the conceived scenes from Teheran (in the titles are the sign historical photographs of the events and that in what way the same situations were demonstrated in a film - of considerable differences in it isn't indicative). </seg>
<seg id="21">The Hollywood excerpts, on the other hand facilitated, intersecting irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="22">And afterwards else a scene from the headquarters of CIA and other institutions - the men in the suits discuss a situation behind the tables of negotiations, on the ladders of the institutions, by a telephone… </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleku has remarkably succeeded in making the re take-off of career. </seg>
<seg id="24">From a ridiculed actor have become a respectful director, also his game has stopped being an object of mockeries. </seg>
<seg id="25">"An operation "of Slang" its third full-length film after dark detective story "Farewell the my own darling, farewell" (2007) and a thriller "City" (2010). </seg>
<seg id="26">In the same time it is the Affleka first film which isn't shot in the native city of the director - Boston. </seg>
<seg id="27">The emotion of the atmosphere of place in this case relates to the qualities which elevated the earlier films of the director over Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="28">And Afflek reveals it in "Slang" where Canada "plays" Teheran. </seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes happen in a film in the streets, in a reconstruction of the real events - the entrance scenes of fall impress the embassies on their clarity which also conveys emotions of the confusion and unforeseenness which arises, when somewhere suddenly the history changes. </seg>
<seg id="30">Afflek similar effect and it the colleagues reach in the fictitious scenes (the false headquarters on Teheran bazaar). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The processes in too many places are too much. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to have an affair with the fact that the narration doesn't suppose a set of the exciting scenes of the cinematographic value. </seg>
<seg id="33">He enough successfully works with these few things, thinks - something through occasionally there all of it goes out not so elegantly (the scene in which telephone call in America prevents an approaching crisis in an airport of Teheran, and the chase on a runway look enough far-fetched). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Dispersion, connected with the necessity to show too many events in too many places, is the shortage "of Slang". </seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Gudman in the Hollywood colleagues' role are indeed very charming, however their characters would deserve *greater* space, and they are in a film far not the sole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleka film is in short supply a little *dramatic_effect* watch the film of which possible with moderate interest estimating production and retro-style re-creating it, the thrillers of the seventieth. </seg>
<seg id="37">But capture with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="38">However it is sufficiently reminder about one, still in the known sense of living story, as well as for an evidence of that as exaggerated idea of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services. </seg>

<seg id="1">The rules of inflation of the balloons, the bananas and a circus </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A competition "in the most absurd decree or the project from a workshop of EU", about yearly conducting a polling most absurd bank collections, have now decided to announce the portal www.bankovnipoplatky com. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"Us spodviglo to it in which EU plans to receive the last event have declared 40-percent quote for the women in the administration of the large European companies" - "Right" organizer of questionnaire Patrick Nager. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">There is a recent decision of the European court on a union with a stake of insurance payments for the men and the women among the absurdities, put forward nomination already. </seg>
<seg id="5">Hitherto the women had benefits to insurance of life, because for the insurance companies they objectively are less subject to risk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"The people can get farther incredible ideas from a workshop of EU from a competition before the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="7">The voting itself will take place before the end of February 2013" -, Nager has said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">To the questionable orders of EU relates, for example also obligatory addition of bio components into fuel, which, as a result, causes harm to nature, as well as a ban on use of the reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain, the relatively small number of dangerous substances, or the directive size are the cages for the hens, due to which in this year the eggs have considerably risen in price. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A factual ban on use of a term "sandwich oil" or a withdrawal from a sale of the classical bulbs has been subject also to the criticism. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The quality bananas must be the length of 14 centimetres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The all-Europe apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of that or different the trading or industrial lobbies the positions of which in Brussels are usually protected with any state or a group of the states (Czechia now even under threat veta advocates the requirements of their banks with such an image). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Interests of the lobby are such:, for example the bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to have the length of 14 centimetres and didn't dare to reveal "abnormal curvature". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In this case the European Commission was justified with the fact that only harmonize the existing scattered national rules which complicated trade. </seg>
<seg id="14">EU notwithstanding the resistance of some states has nevertheless softened standards, touching the fruits and the vegetables refering to the fact that existing directives will result in *squandering*/dissipation of products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate on gain in a polling can become also the last year's decree of the EU, agrees the air balls, to which selling themselves, necessarily must supply with a warning about the fact that the children are more junior than eight years they cannot be inflated without the adults' care. </seg>
<seg id="16">EU has appealed to the American investigations in accordance with which the air balls in a game are a potential cause of the children's death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="17">The similar restriction now spreads on the children before 14 years to which it is forbidden to blow into fair dudelki. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Amusing ideas are born also at home </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Sufficiently absurd is and governed, touched the European officials: each who has any official job in EU, cannot taking delicacy of the theme for Greece into account use the name of Macedonia, but have to instead of it say "BYURM" (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The portal Bankovnipoplatky.com in cooperation with a union with the liberal economists has proposed "the Principle of non-intervention" (Laissez Faire) for a voting, the absurd rules, besides several higher stated, for example, the rule of EU about the volume of the food reserves in the territory of the membership state. </seg>
<seg id="21">EU has set the maximum volume of the reserves of food which can be in the territory of the Czech Republic for a day of its entry to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="22">Czechia has hereafter exceeded, for example the set volumes of the canned mushrooms, for which her the heavy fine threatened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of questionnaire has also attracted also the idea to pay to some countries for that, that they haven't a sea, is also the idea of allocation of the grants for a declaration of reception of the grants. </seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas have arisen in Prague, and not in Brussels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We hold a disadvantageous position, because we haven't a sea. </seg>
<seg id="26">We shall ask the European Union about compensation", - the then minister of agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CHSDP) declared 2004 years in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="27">As argument, he has indicated that there was bountiful crop of a grain in the country, also as a result of the so named interventional purchases, the state had the full magazines of the reserves it was necessary to take which away. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the fact that Czechia is far from the ports, EU, according to a Palas had to pay hundreds of millions of euros to us. </seg>
<seg id="29">In a total the European commission has gone to meet the Czech Republic organizing tender of a purchase of a grain from the countries which haven't an exit to a sea. </seg>
<seg id="30">The grants for reception of the grant has proposed to the villages the Ministry of regional development, led by minister Pavel Nemtsem (US-DEU) in particular such grants had to go from Brussels on compilation of a declaration on the grant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: the Fancy orders are exception </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the decrees in the states-members easily become an object of criticism, the effort of EU in adjustment, as well as more effectively functioning and the development of the European Union confessions in many experts' opinion deserve rather. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Scooping of the grants from EU for the projects which haven't even the hint at anything common to a recess of European integration, which the states-members have however attained in discussion of a budget in the experts' opinion is the serious problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Cause emotions among the Czechs and the fact that the Republic, as also in other countries of the European Union Czech, must struggle in Brussels for right of specific identification of its traditional products, and not always it wins in this competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the Czechs after six years of battles with the Germans and the Austrians have kept a name "the Olomoutskie cheese curds", however "Tuzemskij the rum" traditions of which in our country go away with roots in a century, 19, our producers are have to, was to rename on "Tuzemak". </seg>
<seg id="36">Only the products from cane distillate, and not from the sugar beetroot can be called rum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In an official list of registered products EU together with marzipan from German Lyubeka or the Parma ham, worldwide famous for the cheeses "of *Fet*" and "gorgondzola", is narrower, it has turned, out, for example, the Karlovy Vary rusks, pogorzhelitskij and trshebon'skij, the carp and zhatetskij are drunkenness. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The people want me to protect the republic, but I am an amateur -, Okamura asserts. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr senator, how to run for the president's office comes for the person to the head? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't think about the fact to become oneself a senator or the president. </seg>
<seg id="4">If with us in a country everything functioned without the problems then I anywhere wouldn't run. </seg>
<seg id="5">But I cannot see, as in the last 20 years the country is plundered as here the thieves, fuss, taxes and pensionable age increase for the people already. </seg>
<seg id="6">I hadn't the ambitions to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="7">But I when I see somehow that don't please, me then try to find a solution as change it. </seg>
<seg id="8">And since I have already accomplished forty years and I an independent person, not relating not to, am the parties to which at, there is no me for the other possibility to influence the things except as run for an office of a senator or the president. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You have got to a Senate but have shortly departed to a presidential lock. </seg>
<seg id="10">Don't you turn from such an image by the back to the people who have chosen you? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I said all the time that I would join to struggle for a presidential lock of depending on result of the election to a Senate. </seg>
<seg id="12">I have later precised that I if I am chosen by the senator then shall run for the presidents. </seg>
<seg id="13">My aim isn't job, the job is the instrument with the help of which I can realize its glances. </seg>
<seg id="14">The greatest influence and the widest authorities therefore are for me necessary. </seg>
<seg id="15">But difficulty not only in the fact that we as a nation repine with us in a bar or at the TV set, but in this case is ready to trample any who will try to change something. </seg>
<seg id="16">The mass media which denigrate the person, and which confound freedom of speech with freedom of lie add to it. </seg>
<seg id="17">It was told that I gave the bribes to the journalists, or that I was adviser Irzhi Paroubeka me, for example about. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We shall pass to your glances. </seg>
<seg id="19">For a presidential lock you have started with the theses on material and criminal responsibility of the politicians and the reverse property declarations to sum above twenty million struggle. </seg>
<seg id="20">It is to realize it necessary to change a law. </seg>
<seg id="21">You, as the president, haven't such authorities, and only the entire senate can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this task? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I, as a citizen, lobbied the fact that the execution of excursions has become a free enterprise it has proved possible to advance it. </seg>
<seg id="24">The problem consists in intrigue - when somebody comes with good offer on left or on right, obstacles, are deliberately raised for him, and it restrains the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent nonpartisan person, I have the much *greater* potential for reception of a support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="26">I without party-spreading out over the shelves, without looking back at doctrines can take my advantage that me what appears best for our country also to use that, it from each party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you believe yourself the person, more relating to right or left? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">It seems that the people class me sooner among left from a Czech viewpoint to me. </seg>
<seg id="29">A little to the left or a little to the right are in general not important for me. </seg>
<seg id="30">It is important for me that we walked ahead. </seg>
<seg id="31">The matter concerns not about what somebody relates to right, and, somebody, to left, I want to combine the people. </seg>
<seg id="32">I always shall support any decision whether will propose him KPCHM or GDP, good for a society, and I exactly as shall be against bad idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You are angry when somebody says that you are a populist. </seg>
<seg id="34">But don't you prove it by the fact that you have said? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create business-plan for a company you also have some ideal aims and glances. </seg>
<seg id="36">And you try to approach it. </seg>
<seg id="37">It is possible to name it populism, but about which I say all offers, already functions in the world, or the eminent experts speak them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But only the slogans will remain without your support of the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="39">And with it you long won't hold out in a politician. </seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that when you will go out to the people and will you speak them then you will succeed in realizing criminal and material responsibility? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I haven't the other possibility. </seg>
<seg id="42">Only to convince the politicians, the journalists and a community and try to lure them away on their side, so that we attain own. </seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected to president then wouldn't make up a problem, to organize TV live broadcast, in which I shall appeal to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with appeal to legitimate material and criminal is responsibility for the politicians of the state the serving, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="44">And they in a case of a refusal will be have to report why it isn't wanted. </seg>
<seg id="45">If the strong personality which will vocalize abuses is then it will be possible to exercise the pressure on a political scene. </seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president - it was merit of the pressure of the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I say directly that I am an amateur, and is not a genius and is not an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="48">I try to look for the allies to advocate my convictions and glances. </seg>
<seg id="49">I only beginning am in a politician, and I for my programme shall try to find a support of majority. </seg>
<seg id="50">I try to advance the affairs independently; I in that case if it doesn't prove, possible shall finish in six years and I shall return to a private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It partly sounds so, like Okamura must salvage Czechia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not no saviour. </seg>
<seg id="53">I know that alone I shan't do anything, I have therefore bypassed a number of known people with offer to run to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="54">I have gone to Radimu Yanchure, he has refused in connection with the large volume of work. </seg>
<seg id="55">Also I have at least supported journalist Yana Lorentsovu which has disclosed fraud with light fuel oil products conducting investigations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I have put forward my candidacy because the people also really are non satisfied, but now I feel myself on the weights. </seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of people haven't gone on an election, and the majority of ones who have gone, the representatives of an establishment have been chosen. </seg>
<seg id="58">We independent only two are in a Senate. </seg>
<seg id="59">The people have chosen a Senate so that changes will come true with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="60">Notwithstanding it I shall struggle for my glances, for example for the direct election of the mayors and the governors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about a base for an own party? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The about it me yet not thought, because at there is no me time of the fact to check the purity of past each potential partisan, and I am not at on it of money. </seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money also on a presidential campaign, there are only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent bill. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Haven't you money? </seg>
<seg id="65">Do you speak the property declarations, and how are your own affairs with it? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The personal property is estimated approximately at 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="67">With me well also several more million in an account are, the area is in Prague of the cost of about 25 million, the apartment on 10 million, one more apartment on 8 million, collection of products of art approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin on 3,5 million and Skoda Superb on a million. </seg>
<seg id="68">To the purpose Aston-Martin has appeared at me because it was my boyish dream - me always pleased Dzhejms Bond who rode a machine, was gallant with the women and in the same time struggled against meanness and lawlessness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do you do Aston-ride on Martin, do you possess a property on 60 million and at you, is there no money on a campaign? </seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but you specially don't want in it to invest own money. </seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very persuasive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I haven't 15 millions on a campaign. </seg>
<seg id="73">Must I fall in debts? </seg>
<seg id="74">I have inserted in a campaign already 2,5 million. </seg>
<seg id="75">It is that fact that I haven't the sponsors, testifies to the fact that my programme is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="76">And I must not pay for the election campaign from my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="77">Senatorial salary will cover expenses for a campaign over of essence to me. </seg>
<seg id="78">But on this money I wouldn't live, for example, couldn't pay to a son for the English school which costs 30 thousand monthly. </seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted only to make money so anywhere wouldn't run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Then further will you deal with an enterprise, so that it is possible to live? </seg>
<seg id="81">Didn't you really say that you would reduce this activity? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it doesn't depend on the size of salary. </seg>
<seg id="83">As I also promised, I have partially reduced my activity. </seg>
<seg id="84">My deputy in spring will become, for example manager director of the tourist agency. </seg>
<seg id="85">The people would want, which which I was bessrebrennikom, will store, the republic. </seg>
<seg id="86">But it is for me too necessary on something to live. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much have as a businessman you got accustomed to receive monthly? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What I also further from two hundred to four hundred thousand receive. </seg>
<seg id="89">And if I have become a president, then would finish one's enterprise. </seg>

<seg id="2">"This building seems cheerful, it looks futuristichno, it finally with us again is possible to see something interesting -, Lizette Verkhajg speaks, the passer-by is on an edge of the road to me". </seg>
<seg id="3">And Stephen Spermon, the specialist in IT on a situated nearby large enterprise, believes so: "No this building is indeed beautiful". </seg>
<seg id="4">But do I ask myself: what we need one more library today for? </seg>
<seg id="5">Everybody has the Internet, the iPad and the electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="6">Does already nobody now voluntarily go to such oldfashioned libraries probably? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">An unusual record belongs to the sleeping small town near Rotterdam, Spejkenisse-small notable. </seg>
<seg id="8">The population quantity his 80.000 people have the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="9">For struggle with this vexatious circumstance it several years ago was decided to make a contribution to common formation and build seven fictitious bridges which are depicted on the banknotes of the euro, as the pictorially coloured miniatures from ferroconcrete. </seg>
<seg id="10">The success in this enlightening initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="11">And then the fathers of the city understood that in them had remained the sole possibility to overcome statistics: build a library here! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Accuse Maas from the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, the expert on the brave *STOLBCHATYJ* diagrams and the author of even the witty, occasionally cynical constructions, have treated a task with their common imperturbation and have appeared on competitively listening in the year 2003 with five books under a mouse and grin on the face. </seg>
<seg id="13">And as long as the members of a jury puzzledly looked around and *SHRUG1* of the shoulders, impudent Maas has made up a pyramid in size for their original gift and has completed speech in defense of their project the next words: "about the Respectful townspeople"! </seg>
<seg id="14">It, my offer: here are "the Book mountain" is in Spejkenisse so named Bukenberg! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">After nine years this mountain of the cost of 30 million of a euro has grown. </seg>
<seg id="16">She is the part of the project revitalizatsii which includes also an underground garage, the supermarket, the dwelling houses and taunkhausov altogether on 50 apartments adjoining them will esteem also several. </seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November "the Book mountain" was noted the second prize of the competition "the Best library of the Netherlands of 2012". </seg>
<seg id="18">Also the project provides a national Dutch competition in the wooden buildings 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In such a way the faceless suburb which before couldn't propose anything except a postmodernistic pedestrian zone and the surprisingly ugly town hall of which the white facades are led to the idea of a dairy has become richer in one modern work of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="20">But most important - into Spejkenisse has appeared a public building of cultural destination is the first in the history of this small town. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A long road to a book </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: book *EL'DORADO* is under a hood for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="23">Only one lift, going at the center of mountain range, for the real admirers of architecture and reading will prefer to investigate this locality on foot, is here. </seg>
<seg id="24">The glazed from all sides the room is light and easily is comprehensible floors from a burned brick also the elegant street lanterns unerringly create a feeling of the public urban area. </seg>
<seg id="25">The urban medium is re-created ideally. </seg>
<seg id="26">Involuntarily look for glance the benches, the boys and the girls, also playing the dogs in football. </seg>
<seg id="27">And the books, the books, the books are everywhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"The usually book regiments stand along the facades, and in middle is a large dark hall as a rule, comfortless and faceless", - speaks Accuse Maas. </seg>
<seg id="29">We have placed classical configuration of space from the legs on the head and have extracted a zone for reading from within outside. </seg>
<seg id="30">Internal space of the book mountain is used skilfully: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the ecological center and the technical rooms are at the center. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A sabot: "the Germans must play a more important role" </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has abstained in a voting about confession of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="3">In opinion of Stephen Sabo, the expert on the connections between the USA and Europe acting so Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic track. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany at first allowed understand that she will vote against an application of the Palestinians of reception of a status of an observer at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained in a voting. </seg>
<seg id="6">Why? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Sabo: Germany doesn't support action of the Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="8">It is now for Germany necessary to be cautious in connection with its special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9">But simultaneously I believe that it also doesn't support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - at it not appearing too critically Israel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany has also abstained in a voting about introduction of a forbidden zone for the flights. </seg>
<seg id="12">In the total of NATO have conducted this offer. </seg>
<seg id="13">Does Germany find it difficult to hold a distinct position in the complicated international questions? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is so. </seg>
<seg id="15">The matter is that it is in a process of conversion of its foreign policy, namely passes from policy of which so to say the USA were controlled to properly German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is additionally complicated with the fact that coordinated integral policy is absent at the Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="17">Thus the Germans again turn out between two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they to it haven't got accustomed from them. </seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that as long as they only fumble with my role, but is on a way to "more normal" foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="20">Such a foreign policy which France or Great Britain conduct. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What does the "normal" foreign policy from a German viewpoint specifically mean? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is readiness to hold a position, not depending on a position of the USA or the European partners, in its national interests. </seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy i.e. from export and the connections with the definite regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="24">Economic interests of Germany to a significant extent differ from interests of other large states, and therefore Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Have influenced these economic interests on a position in the Middle East conflict and on a voting in the UN? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First Germany has the large markets of a sale in the Middle East in particular in the states of the Persian gulf. </seg>
<seg id="27">It therefore is for her necessary to show caution not to insult a community and the elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="28">In any case it plays its role. </seg>
<seg id="29">But I wouldn't attach too great importance to it, it is not a completely unilateral connection. </seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case it plays an important role in calculations of the Germans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Has Germany harmed to its relations with the USA abstaining in making of the important decisions, such as a voting about Palestine? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in Europe and even to the USA prevails understanding of a German position. </seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore I don't think that it was the same dramatic fracture as in a Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps Germany will even acquire respect, by such an image defined. </seg>
<seg id="35">However it signals the fact that it is necessary to perceive her earnestly as a player on international arena and that behoves to reckon with its interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Different opinions about a Palestinian initiative exist in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="37">The USA have conversely distinctly spoken out for veto. </seg>
<seg id="38">Is there disagreement between opinions between the USA and many European states? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Owing to American inner policy such differences existed always. </seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the government of Obama in the depth of the soul has sufficient understanding of a European position. </seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with a local political situation the government, of course, cannot openly hold such a position. </seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that essential disagreements in opinions are quite not so significant, as always seems. </seg>
<seg id="43">You if you consider relations between Obama and prime minister Netanyahu then will notice that Obama is quite not in admiration for Netanyahu's policy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Does Germany find it easy to combine its close connections with Israel and the USA on the one hand and a position of the most important partner in EU from other? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think just it makes a situation of such difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the Germans would find it somewhat simpler if integral, non-contradictory European policy, existed, but now it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore they cannot appear within the framework of wider approach and is forced instead of it act leaning against only the own vision of a situation. </seg>
<seg id="48">Just so they treat a euro. </seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the production of a common European position on *MYSELF*. </seg>
<seg id="50">It is understandable that for Germany it is not simple at least because of the connections with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="51">This theme always was ticklish. </seg>
<seg id="52">But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany itself sees itself in a role of an important international player - won't she take the indeed main role on herself? </seg>
<seg id="54">Or is else heavily still the leading role given to Germany? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany hasn't got accustomed to it yet, to play a significant role hitherto and, for the obvious causes, hitherto always heavily yields is always disagreeable for her. </seg>
<seg id="56">We shall view, for example, when the crisis of the euro is each time Germany takes an important role on ourselves, most different anti German emotions are manifested. </seg>
<seg id="57">The Germans must not just cope with it. </seg>
<seg id="58">Properly speaking, it is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded with the hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="59">From this viewpoint Germany holds a significantly heavier position than the USA. </seg>
<seg id="60">She must take into account of the most different neighbours and opinion, and it is not simple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Does influence of the USA in European policy thus permanently weaken, but at a given moment of EU don't fill in this vacuum, who then remains? </seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans just will have to play a more significant role. </seg>
<seg id="63">Even if it doesn't please you, it is disagreeable or reinforces your - dislike the life is such! </seg>

<seg id="1">"The protection of the goods signs" is in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly will become Chinese </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani - worldwide known trademark Polo Ralph Lauren - too. </seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo such? </seg>
<seg id="4">This name which hasn't anything common to the companies from the names of which it is formed, perfectly officially registered in China. </seg>
<seg id="5">It will be nevertheless guarded, until the owners of the initial names file for a suit. </seg>
<seg id="6">But it is then unclear whether it will prove possible with him to advocate the rights. </seg>
<seg id="7">"The foreigners find it still more difficult to protect their goods signs in China" - the, Thomas Pattlokh speaks, lawyer of a company of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of rights of the goods signs in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="8">On my table by each week appear in a new affair of such a kind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For the imitators sufficiently to add in all a couple of letters to acquire right to register one's trading signs. </seg>
<seg id="10">So from Gucci turns out Lu-Gucci, it instead of Prada is possible to register Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="11">The German enterprises, for example, the producer of sports goods of Puma are legally copied by the same mode. </seg>
<seg id="12">Pattlokh opens a folder with the recordings of the department of a registration of the goods signs in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 September 2010 the Chinese company registered trading sign Zegna DF Puma, the artificial name for which also the name of the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna is used there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese are the champions of the world in copying and violation of rights of an intellectual property, known. </seg>
<seg id="15">There in the large cities are multistorey department stores, selling almost only the counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="16">Which the opposes fact that the Chinese enterprises perfectly officially acquired a he however is Pattlokha affairs not such On assignment of his principals right to use name is narrower is guarded somewhere else from the department of a registration of the goods signs. </seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese name it "ban a share, the mark-passenger are the ministry". </seg>
<seg id="18">This word associates itself "with ban dakuan'". </seg>
<seg id="19">The women who hunt for the rich men are so named. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities don't recognize guilt behind them </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It causes damage to business, to struggle, - with it is necessary", Pattlokh is convinced. </seg>
<seg id="22">"The trademark diffuses, the unique position gets lost, the image very strongly suffers". </seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and judicial expenses in branches that have suffered are calculated with millions especially in a case of expensive copied products. </seg>
<seg id="24">According to data of the company of investigations to market CLSA China with the volume of the sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third in size and most quickly growing market of a sale of the items of luxury. </seg>
<seg id="25">To attain removal of the doubtful recordings in register of the trading signs is however difficult, and it costs dearly. </seg>
<seg id="26">The process can last up to nine years, with unclear outcome. </seg>
<seg id="27">Pattlokh tells about the affairs, into which the court rejected the suits, for upon expiration of the long time the contested name has become "reality of market". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff hasn't luck then he will even have to pay to a plagiarist, for have caused damage to its trading sign in China, Pattlokh speaks. </seg>
<seg id="29">Occasionally here the law of the jungles corrects. </seg>
<seg id="30">There are also famous cases of the graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the company of Daimler lost judicial argument with a producer of construction machines Sany, the enterprise which has shortly before that acquired a company-producer of concrete-pumps Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore the Chinese hitherto have right to use emblem, similar to a star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="33">The company of Geely that has bought Volvo initially used a blue-white logotype, a process is BMW; that was reminding, Geely was successful, one has had to change him. </seg>
<seg id="34">The producer of fashionable goods of Lacoste has lost in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore at which the famous crocodile saw the other side. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities don't believe themselves guilty. </seg>
<seg id="36">The department of a registration of the goods signs CTMO in Beijing confirms that in the year 2010 because of a shortage of the personnel and the equipment of the rooms there had a place of difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year "the return from emergency in a working process to norm" happened. </seg>
<seg id="38">So the number of crude affairs over objections has diminished by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57.000 such affairs were closed 75 percent more than in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="40">Productions in a department nevertheless still else expect 81.500 complaints. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It dearly is worth struggling with it </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As very frequent in China figures impress. </seg>
<seg id="43">In the last year in CTMO more than 1,4 million declarations of the protection of the trading signs entered almost the third more than into 2010. </seg>
<seg id="44">It also means, which China for the tenth time in succession has headed, the record, a department reports the list of the new registrations in the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="45">The same concerns the common number of actual trading signs, in all 5,5 million pieces. </seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 1,8 billion yuans of collections were paid off. </seg>
<seg id="47">If simplify it means that each registration stands on the average in 1280 yuans or 160 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is worth contesting many times more her as an affair of the German family enterprise of Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="49">Over a distance of more than seven years the concern struggles against a Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans have succeeded in attaining the fact that the illegal production by him of the false automobile details was liquidated. </seg>
<seg id="51">The imitator has however allotted Chinese rights of trading sign Freudenberg for himself. </seg>
<seg id="52">It was an own omission, for the last names in Germany must not is *PROTECTION*, Khanno Venttsler speaks, the head of the board of administration Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="53">And the department of a registration of the trading signs CTMO has rejected a complaint myunkhentsev. </seg>
<seg id="54">True in the both next instances Freudenberg has won, but the opposite side continues struggle hitherto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It is necessary to it be on the alert </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the question is on consideration in the Supreme court. </seg>
<seg id="57">Venttsler hopes to bring up an affair to good termination and praises professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "the Process is exceedingly expensive and takes away much time, money and the nerves from us". </seg>
<seg id="59">Internal expenditures hardly yield to a registration, the archive of the company, one has had to view even the acts of a centennial prescription to give the proofs. </seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago Freudenberg without results proposed "large six digit sum of a euro" for settlement to an opposite side. </seg>
<seg id="61">"It hence is clear how dearly it costs - us", Venttsler speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Dangers of the Far East threaten to bandy even to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="63">Namely the in that case if imitators will register the unprotected trading signs there behind them. </seg>
<seg id="64">So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name of Freudenberg for the footwear and products of the skin. </seg>
<seg id="65">The concern has long ago stopped production in these regions, but notwithstanding it could prevent a registration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It is necessary to it be on - the alert", Venttsler speaks. </seg>
<seg id="67">Both he, and lawyer Pattlokh recommend to the German enterprises to be very cautious of China. </seg>
<seg id="68">It is insufficient to rely upon the international theses on the protection of the goods signs rather the foreigners, it follows, Venttsler speaks, "that in any way it is worth protecting everything, register also in China" -. </seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can manage much dearer than a registration. </seg>
<seg id="70">It is actual: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of a trading sign, then to pay license collections to an opposite side for an own name, will be have to, Venttsler explains. </seg>
<seg id="71">We shall be otherwise forced out from a market in a questionable segment. </seg>

<seg id="4">At first sounds heeling: the cowboy high boots, the basketball gym-shoes, the lady boats and the male slippers pick up the time on the parquet floor and quickly find him. </seg>
<seg id="5">The time-two-three-four. </seg>
<seg id="6">Only after it the voices of the singers - the viola, the bass, the tenor and a soprano - they advance, charm and follow each other slowly grow. </seg>
<seg id="7">Khopf, and *phita* a 29 year-old conductor, almost bounce out of one's cloth shoes, when lead them with flexible and expressive gestures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">An evening of Monday, the in a musical hall institute of medical, psychology in Khajdel'berge the chorus of Imbongi rehearses new song. </seg>
<seg id="9">Fifty participants of a chorus from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in genetics of a person to a janitor have come on rehearsal. </seg>
<seg id="10">"Ohm" Obani" - not simple thing, each voice of the chorus has its text besides, in the perfectly alien language: which the, *Zulu*, eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique speak and in some parts of Swaziland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help is for self-help </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to the grade of Unaids of the programme of the United Nations of struggle with AIDS about 34 million HIV-infected in the world exist. </seg>
<seg id="13">23,5 million from them live in the south of Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland 000 orphans of AIDS live in 245. </seg>
<seg id="15">In this case more than 40 percent of the population by HIV-are positive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village Esitzheni union Voices for Africa has found the chiefs in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them visit a school, preparing for a farther instruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros per month it is possible to take patronage on oneself. </seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees money on the center to a child the school, Gogh's-school uniform and, daily hot lunch in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi in a *Zulu* language means a narrator or voskhvalitel'. </seg>
<seg id="21">In this hall isn't told fluently, on for the bow on the other hand is *CAN1* to sing. </seg>
<seg id="22">The chorus learns almost ten years songs in this alien soft language and from time to time even brings them again there where they for the first time have appeared: to the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="23">The village Esitzheni which depends on the voices of the German chorus is however at the distance of 8733 kilometres of summer from Khajdel'berga, in the north-west of the kingdom Swaziland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There about 2000 people some hitherto in the simple huts from clay and a straw, there are many children among the inhabitants are lived. </seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them have remained without the parents who have died from a virus ICH. </seg>
<seg id="27">Into Esitzheni in a miniature is reflected the disease of the whole Swaziland: the highest level of HIV-infection, the expected duration of life according to data of UNICEF, lowest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="28">Cutting of the extreme flesh have the men which dokazanno decreases risk of infection half, among the population, it isn't almost accepted. </seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry a virus of immunodeficiency in oneself, the death is on the middle of the fourth ten - not the rarity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The chorus has opened this village in a joint journey Africa in spring of 2005, but before, participants Imbogni have seen a set of the children in the streets for which there weren't enough not only parental care, but just everything: food, the clothes of education. </seg>
<seg id="31">No chances without school formation with a person are in a poor country in general. </seg>
<seg id="32">At first it was private obligation of the individual participants - for several euros per year send a child to a school and grant a possibility of times per day to it to receive hot food. </seg>
<seg id="33">But after already a year the chorus has based the union "Voices for Africa" which since then almost professionally takes care about the orphans of AIDS into Esitzheni. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">The facts of about infections conveyed by the sexual way </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important diseases, conveyed by the sexual way? </seg>
<seg id="36">Syphilis, khlamidioz and a gonorrhoea (the gonorrhoea) is classed among bacterial IPPP. </seg>
<seg id="37">Viral IPPP are frequent, HIV, the human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="38">The pubic pediculosis and the scabies relate to parasitic IPPP. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the basic struck groups? </seg>
<seg id="40">The syphilis and the gonorrhoea occur in the main thing at the men which make love for the men. </seg>
<seg id="41">The institute of Robert Koch proceeds from the fact that the minimum of four of each five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, the transfer happens as a result of sexual contacts between the men. </seg>

<seg id="43">The dissemination of HIV among the heterosexual adults with us is comparatively low - however about 20 percent of new infections of HIV fall on this group. </seg>
<seg id="44">One occurs among the youth khlamidijnye infection considerably more often than among other groups of the population. </seg>
<seg id="45">According to European data, three quarters of all infections strike the young people from 15 to 25 years. </seg>

<seg id="4">The space department of the USA has proved the presence of ice on planet Mercury to NASA. </seg>
<seg id="5">There although she is situated closest of all to the sun there also is water that has frozen as emerges from three investigations, published on Thursday in Science special magazine. </seg>
<seg id="6">Probe "Messendzher" has found the proofs of the fact that the region of the planet, permanently being in shadow, is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="7">Its thickness must equal the minimum of 30 centimetres, and, perhaps, even before 20 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Presumptively water originates from comet or, a, perhaps, asteroid that has collided with Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="9">Nobody connects opening of ice with existence of life on a planet, the scientific leader of a probe Sean Solomon has said. </seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature on Mercury can be the 426 degrees of Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="11">However these discoveries would be able to help to explain how water and other construction elements of life have got to other places of the Solar system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Imperceptibly for the inhabitants of the earth the probes, the telescopes and the small robots, for example, "the Phoenix" investigate the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="13">From time to time they send on the earth the images: the small windows into infinite distances. </seg>
<seg id="14">The image enters from the chamber which the German researchers from the Institute of Max Planck have developed. </seg>

<seg id="17">This fragment of the infrared photograph of telescope "Spittser" represents "the family portrait" of the countless generations of the stars: the oldest stars as the blue points, as it is more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" stars in star circle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This region of *ZVEZDOOBRAZOVANIE* - the scientists non romantic names his W5 - opened with a telescope "of Spittser" in constellation *Cassiopeia*, at the distance of 6500 light years. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">The photograph, published by the European Southern observatory, shows haziness, removed on several thousand light years, of Trifid in constellation of Sagittarius. </seg>
<seg id="35">Trifid name has originated from a Latin word trifidus (triple, three separate), for the dark bands of dust are divided into three if the incandesced heart of the cradle of the stars had done rapidly. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">In constellation of *ZMEENOSETs* the astronomers have photographed presage of space collision: at the distance of 400 million light years the nuclei two Galaxies, from the earth poured out, rush to meet each other and unavoidably will collide. </seg>

<seg id="49">The researchers suppose that she has arisen shortly before the Big bang, when in the main thing there was hydrogen in the universe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our glances to the universe: the most important telescopes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Probably the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem - else before Galileo Galileo has year later started observation of the stars. </seg>
<seg id="52">Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became still more - and accessible to their glance spaces are still deeper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">During "*KHALA*" in an observatory of Fallen *MARA* is 30 years namely from 1947 to 1975 old the telescope near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror depicted here had diameter five metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the USA "the Large binocular telescope" is set. </seg>
<seg id="56">He allows seeing of space with the help of two mirrors, each by diameter 8,4 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"Grain Teleskopio Kanarias" has a gigantic internal device - the diameter of alone of only the mirror reaches 10,4 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror "of the Large south African telescope" in the South Africa is segmented - for the sake of decrease in cost. </seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless in diameter it reaches about eleven metres. </seg>
<seg id="60">A shortage of inexpensive constructive execution: the telescope rigidly is fastened at a vertical angle - it restricts its mobility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope "Hobby-Eberli" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="62">Its peculiarity: the high light-assembling ability. </seg>
<seg id="63">She reaches - the parameters of the largest world telescopes notwithstanding the comparatively small diameter of the mirror -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of the radio telescope into Aresibo (Puerto Rico) the researchers listen to the extraterrestrial signals in space. </seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has diameter 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="66">Participating in the project "Search for an extraterrestrial mind" (SETI) any owner of a computer can help granting his computational power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">A view on an observatory of the European astronomical service (ESO) in Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="68">Here stands "a Very large telescope" - completely corresponding to its name. </seg>
<seg id="69">Its four mirrors allow illuminating of even the average infrared spectrum in a visual pipe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">In the Chilean observatory ESO the installation "of a European Very large telescope" is also planned. </seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror must spread out on the entire 42 metres - will be also made up for almost 1000 mirror elements. </seg>
<seg id="72">It however is necessary not to expect the photographs earlier than 2018. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Before 2007 both telescopes "Kek" on Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were believed largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="74">Two mirrors of diameter ten metres are installed into them. </seg>
<seg id="75">Telescopes "Kek" are included into composition of the observatory Mauna-Kea which together with them sees also the sky with the help of telescopes "Subaru" and IRTTF. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Besides that the new gigantic telescope - with a mirror of diameter thirty metres on Mauna-Kea must appear. </seg>
<seg id="77">It here for them is possible to admire illustrations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">Space telescope "Hubble" however delivers space the most important kinds. </seg>
<seg id="79">Since 24 April 1990 he delivers the pictures of the far worlds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">From March 2009 space telescope "Kepler" looks for the planets beyond the limits of the Solar system - primarily such on which the life is possible. </seg>
<seg id="81">On 2 February of the year 2011 of NASA reported, that 1235 planets-candidates were is detected from the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="82">In the photographs the last preparations of space telescope "Kepler" are imprinted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The space telescope of James Uebba (JWST) won't be sent to space earlier than the year 2018 on a board of the rocket "of Arian 5". </seg>
<seg id="84">The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has diameter 6,5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: he must from the world of the first stars and Galaxies look for the Big bang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The scientists suppose that there on the southern pole of Mercury is ice. </seg>
<seg id="87">There are however no certain data on it for "Messendzher" revolves closer to the northern pole of the planet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements over a distance of the decades pointed the fact that there on Mercury is ice. </seg>
<seg id="89">Due to a year, thrown into 2004, probe "Messendzher" - first which revolves about Mercury - the scientists now are sure in it. </seg>

<seg id="9">However they all, hitherto hopelessly dissociated, are in lost opposition, fear is felt. </seg>
<seg id="10">Fear of the religious state on Nile on mercy "of powerful Brothers-Muslims". </seg>
<seg id="11">Mohammed Mursi hardly whether not excusing has said that he temporarily cut down competence of the constitutional court and has expanded his competence "to salvage a revolution". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However the 61 year-old engineer, having the degree of a doctor of the American university of the Southern California, what in fact wants to salvage is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Will the judicial power be deprived of force? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Night 15-hour download through in fact 234 articles succeeded in pulling in a constitutional meeting from 100 participants, and it partially causes fears with obstacles on to islamistski tuned. </seg>
<seg id="15">As also in the previous constitutions, in the project it is told that the legal procedure leans "against the principles of Islamic right". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what means "the principles"? </seg>
<seg id="17">It was both more strict interpretation of Shariat remains interpretations and the, it is possible to fear that, Islamists will use the affair a nebulous statement and legal play for, arising in connection with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least at it hints, one innovative article: it is necessary to attract the university to advice there is Al-Ashar in all the affairs touching Shariat an islamistic institution is the most important is the countries the one that has the high authority in the whole Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19">It is not have to, but a restriction on the judicial power can mean that the clergy oversees legislation that de facto would have by investigation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the project of the constitution is an item of interpretation much </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">One more problem: suability of the civil faces to a military court must remain. </seg>
<seg id="22">These courts in a period of the power of Mubarak served for suppression of the oppositionists. </seg>
<seg id="23">Up to 11.000 civil faces after overthrow of a dictator were in military confinement. </seg>
<seg id="24">Also, as said the project is in the state must guard "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its moral and the values". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Juridically it is formulated so indistinctly that the state institutions with the help of this article will be able to monitor even the keeping of a movie and literature. </seg>
<seg id="26">By the open text it means none other than the censorship. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In general not an article single, sets equality of the men and the women straight. </seg>
<seg id="28">But other forbids to insult and defame prophet Muhammed and his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="29">But that such an insult also as it must be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="30">Doubtful also seems a statement, which is forbidden, "insult of the people". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Will sufficiently caricature of the president or joke about a legist be? </seg>
<seg id="32">The question of interpretation as also much in this project which Mursi proposes on signature and which, according to his words, it "is very quick" will be presented to the Egyptians on referendum. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Norwegian rakfisk: the most badly smelling fish in the world? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">At the five million population of Norway one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but in the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="3">Somehow is the perhaps mystery of success of this country connected with local predilection for one exceedingly rank fish dish? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take several pieces of cheese that have become overripe. </seg>
<seg id="5">Place them into heap of the dirty and sweaty sports clothes. </seg>
<seg id="6">Leave them there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="7">The smell rakfiska - of one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies striking smell you will be able. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small small town by name Fagernes in three hours of ride from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="9">Round there are the picturesque kinds, covered with snow, It very beautiful, but in air poured out ineradicable characteristic smell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It is a Rakfisk - trout is strewn with a salt and being wandering around water before a year, into dependence from what just that odour it is necessary to attain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As twilight thickens, and it grows colder, the crowds of the Norwegians gather on festival in Fagernese, dedicated to it itself, the dish, we shall say so, capturing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"She is eaten with raw and takes to drink the wineglass of aquavit, local caraway vodka" -, Khavard Khal'varsen, explains, the local fireman is by a profession and in pluralism "the rakfiskovyj general" which leads execution of festival. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Everywhere around us the people eat a fish, sliced off the small cubes, and wash her down with the considerable portions of alcohol. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Aquavit more pleases than rakfisk - Khavard speaks somebody". </seg>
<seg id="15">This beverage is capable of interrupting smell. </seg>
<seg id="16">I taste a couple of pieces. </seg>
<seg id="17">If it proves possible to carry a piece under the nose then everything is not so already and badly - in few things differ from the portion of the dry spell which you long carried with it in a bus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk - it is Norwegian product from quite different times, times of poverty, when before appearance of the refrigerators yet the fish in autumn was soaked in the hermetically closed barrels with salty water. </seg>
<seg id="19">Then in deep winter, when the fish already well and solidly began, to ferment she was extracted and, fading down perception by alcohol, used into food. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">On the memory of the past generation yet it is that fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced abandon the country in search for work and emigrate in the main way to the USA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Now the population swiftly grows - the immigrants whom the work places, the high salaries and a developed system of a social support carry here are more than 13 %. </seg>
<seg id="22">The inhabitants of Sweden (long-standing the rival, and yet not so long ago, and more are able of a well-off neighbour) in a mass come here to work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is perceived, an element of the past of Norway is as a certain important symbol, indispensable, just also somewhat rank. </seg>
<seg id="24">It is one of the most expensive local dishes. </seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand here everything is expensive - the small goblet of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds sterling (14 US dollars). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway seldom appears in world news, and, it seems, the majority of the inhabitants of a country make it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The people here hitherto reluctantly mention name Andersa Brejvika of the racist and an extremist of the right use in the last year that has shot and has killed 77 men, the women and the children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Not mentioning his name terrorist action is named "having happened on 22 July". </seg>
<seg id="29">To the Norwegians come to believe that in their peaceable country one of their fellow citizens has turned out capable of similar brutalities and murders is very difficult. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Growth (from the beginning of the seventieth) of one of the largest oil and gas branches in the world provides basis of today's well-being of Norway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Petroleum - is not however sole the cause of our prosperity" - Anna, says, our waitress, is a woman, delivering the trays with self-possessed rakfiskom, with the thick light hair and the strikingly blue eyes incarnation of Nordic well-being. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">How you name - it we are such a people - prudent. </seg>
<seg id="33">As also the Norwegians' majority she beautifully speaks English. </seg>
<seg id="34">We don't like to be exhibited on a show, we are not boastful. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway very sparingly handles its petroleum - the large part of the incomes of oil and gas branch is invested in a special fund, created for good of the future generations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the years that were preceding the world financial crisis, when everybody littered money which they hadn't, Norway parsimoniously counted all expenditures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as it is possible to roll the skis in winter and go into expeditions in summer it is sufficiently happiness" -, Anna speaks. </seg>
<seg id="38">"And rakfisk, - is", she adds with unconcerned laughter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in a queue for some food - from me there will be enough rakfiska in snow. </seg>
<seg id="40">A hamburger with elk meat - exotics here is it is the already precise tasty juicy meat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the else *greater* whole quantity of the same fish with unforgettable smell in the evening expects us. </seg>
<seg id="42">The special dedicated supper, rakfisk in the process of which the visitors by the voting define best or, the, perhaps, most flavourous fish is conducted in my hotel. </seg>
<seg id="43">Live TV broadcast in which the host in tie-butterfly of surrounded with the plates from rakfiskom is shown takes place. </seg>
<seg id="44">It is similar to the song competition "Eurovision". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Thus, what grade Torus-Yurgen have you delivered behind the best fish there with you in the mountains"? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Yes Khavard our estimation is here"…. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Everybody laughs and applauds. </seg>

<seg id="26"> -I thought that I would die in this cage". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Finding in Kvantiko, Manning, according to his words, conducted the large part of the time in a small chamber - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours per twenty four hours - in full solitude. </seg>
<seg id="28">Manning reports that for him it has been permitted to leave only a mattress, the blanket, several items of the clothes and the spectacles are the bedroom slippers. </seg>
<seg id="29">He says that he tried to move, for to sleep or even just lie in daytime forbade the rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The light, penetrating outside a chamber, according to the words of Manning during sleep, him permanently beat at the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="31">If the guards didn't see his face, when it turned over in a bed in the night then according to his words he was awakened and made turn over to the back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Manning's lawyer has given official objection concerning illegal treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="33">In April 2011 Manning was transfered to a military prison into Forth-Livenvort, the state of Kansas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Besides that on Friday the judge inquired Manning about the declaration which he has made during testification on Thursday of the fact that after in the night it was once made to sleep stripped in his chamber into Kvantiko, he has been starved into to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners on the morning checkup. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning has declared that he hadn't a possibility to cover oneself with a blanket during a checkup. </seg>
<seg id="36">Answering with the questions of a judge on Friday Manning has said that he has understood from an order of the guard that it must throw a blanket with which would be able to cover oneself but have recognized that nobody straight ordered to it to throw him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On Thursday Manning declared that in the previous night it had been made to sleep naked because of his attempt to show to an officer that he doesn't constitute danger for himself. </seg>
<seg id="38">Manning has reported that he has told the officer that he would be able to use the cowards' elastic or the bedroom slippers to traumatize himself, but haven't made it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In that night according to Manning's evidence his bottom linen, the bedroom slippers and the spectacles took away from a chamber. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His lawyers hope that the judge at least will take the fact that it has had to outlive during confinement, and considerably will reduce a term of confinement if Manning is recognized as culpable by the military court which must begin consideration of its affair at the beginning of the next year into account. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Protection has declared that it plans to propose to Manning to recognize guilt of less serious crimes, and dispute other accusations as excessive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The resumption of hearings is planned for this weekend, it is expected that the side of accusation will insist on the fact that the conditions of keeping in custody were justified. </seg>
<seg id="43">Pentagon asserts that Manning was present in Kvantiko in accordance with the rules, adjusting keeping of the prisoners with a maximally strict regime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Pandering for Manning to an opponent, illegal assistance to promulgation in the a furnished Internet transfer information, concerning national defense, and stealing of the state property or the documents are reckoned among made accusations. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination - the American's short story is of Mexican origin. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the author's opinion many Mexicans were forced abandon Mexico because of the absence of the possibilities to realize oneself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Mexicans are apt to accuse ones who have left, because they remind the inhabitants of a country complicated times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">*Ruben* Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin burst between two cultures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent journey to the Mexico city I have gone around a corridor for coming, have approached a zone of the border control and have congealed at a place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The signs pointed two queues: alone for Mexicanos (the Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (the foreigners). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I was faced several seconds with them not knowing where to walk. </seg>
<seg id="8">I have grown in the central California, and I was named the whole life the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="9">This just conditional name, like how my friends in Boston name themselves the Irishmen, and the friends from New York believe themselves the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="10">I have later stopped on a complicated construction "American of Mexican origin". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="12">The need for the conditional names or the complicated constructions wasn't here, at my grandfather's home. </seg>
<seg id="13">I was just the American. </seg>
<seg id="14">I say in the Spanish way to ask the questions or answer sufficiently with good for that them. </seg>
<seg id="15">But my dictionary reserve is poorer than that of the carriers of a language, and I cannot get rid of an American accent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">I have therefore come and have stood into a queue for Extranjeros by my American passport. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I recollected this history several days ago, when again elected president of Mexico Enrique Pen'ya N'eto visited the White house and has met president Obama. </seg>
<seg id="18">The questions: about immigration, the drugs and trade, habitual for the meetings with the presidents of these countries, stood on agenda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The president of Singing of N'eto willingly spoke rise of Mexican economy due to which, the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico instead of the fact to get across to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to sign an agreement on the partnership with the USA and Canada and create a certain north American trading block like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="21">Besides that the president of Singing of N'eto has promised to continue a war against the drug cartels in Mexico, no particular offers have however sounded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico relations with the United States are the heavy and full of old resentments question. </seg>
<seg id="23">The Americans' majority have never pondered the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and under the muzzle of the rifles have forced her leaders to decline the half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="24">But the Mexicans think the centuries, and not the minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It therefore is worth missaying only any state worker the USA by just the word of criticism to a side of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society the complaints about the fact that the Americans encroach upon sovereignty of the neighbours here sound. </seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants are filled by bellicosity with Monte's bag. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin, living in the USA, in this case are the most complicated. </seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to speak about resentments? </seg>
<seg id="29">They are sufficiently. </seg>
<seg id="30">There in Mexico are winners and the people who find in this country for themselves of the possibility, and ones for whom there are no such possibilities that have lost. </seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is so many people of Mexican origin only for one cause: at some moment of their family story anybody is a father or is a grandfather - hadn't a possibility to realize himself in Mexico and was forced depart to the north. </seg>
<seg id="32">The most often of all it was the Mexicans of definite type - swarthy, insufficiently well-educated from the poor peasant families. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we remember about it. </seg>
<seg id="34">It is seen in Mexico otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="35">Today our life - it is incarnation of American dream we studied at the good schools and have settled down on good works, but us not forget the fact that even this dream - American, and not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination is entangled and it is unclear, but we know what country to believe own. </seg>
<seg id="37">The united States of America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Besides we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite of the also governing class don't love us. </seg>
<seg id="39">We answer with the same to them. </seg>
<seg id="40">They see reminder of the humiliating defeats in us and treat us as to the people of the second sort as to the factitious Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="41">We insufficiently well speak Spanish, and our connections with Mexico are insufficiently strong. </seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence for them itself is explained with the failures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico they wouldn't leave. </seg>
<seg id="44">We wouldn't turn out now behind the silk curtain, finding full life in the USA but losing the spiritual connections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife has been born in Guadalajara and has legally moved to the USA as far back as in childhood, and reminds of it me the fact that between the real Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin exist definite frictions - the Mexicans more distinctly understand their national identity, and Mexican origin it it hurts the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="46">She the citizen of the USA also believes, which to both these countries belongs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In the same time many my familiar Americans of Mexican origin feel belonging not to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to a Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we love also Bruce Springstina. </seg>
<seg id="49">Receiving the best from two worlds you unavoidably lose roots. </seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we are the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="51">And in the USA we are named the Mexicans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I have elucidated during my journey, as though our relations without that insufficiently is entangled, some Mexican leaders and the representatives of the intelligentsia want to restore relations with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as the their kind ambassadors of Mexico and awaked her interests to the USA. </seg>
<seg id="54">We would be able to tell our friends-Americans about it is what beautiful country also as to visit her superbly is, and the political leaders could be persuaded to strengthen the connections with Mexico. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It aha is finite. </seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing will be produced. </seg>
<seg id="57">Resentments in the past are too much. </seg>
<seg id="58">And taking rupture of the rich and poor, rampancy of corruption and drug trade, into account many of us quite don't believe this country of such already beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="59">Excuse, but understand it oneself, amigos. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And it is just. </seg>
<seg id="61">If the Mexicans' part hitherto cannot forgive the United States that how they have treated Mexico, one and a half centuries ago, they will have to receive, and it is that fact that some Americans of Mexican origin all in resentment that in Mexico have how quite recently treated their kinsmen yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes already. </seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps with us more common than to me seemed. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battles are in the new Middle East </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The agreement on cessation of a fire between Israel and grouping of the Hamas can become the fragile foundation for the farther world </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Is long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East possible? </seg>
<seg id="4">The next round pushes bloodsheds from a conclusion of futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="5">One sounds, who is the first have started; meaningless arguments on that that have become habitual, the set of the buildings is converted into ruins; six Israelis; the rockets, for the first time in the time of a conflict, launched from the territory of sector Gaza, have fallen into killed above 140 Palestinians whose majority have been the civil faces, and vicinity of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Changes however notwithstanding the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians have hopelessly bogged their conflict since early *TIME1* have come to the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="7">Is to possible treat it differently, the events "of Arab spring" have however begun to whirl in a rebellious storm a set of realities that have settled down, and the Palestinians and the Israelis haven't succeeded in remaining aside from whirlwind that has shocked the region. </seg>
<seg id="8">By what, perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even bloodier earlier. </seg>
<seg id="9">The causes, giving hope for an exit from this deadly lockup, however exist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war without the winners </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On the first glance the situation that has been formed doesn't give the causes of optimism. </seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cessation of the fire on which the agreement was signed on 21 November realizes itself collisions that have happened in this week have only strengthened the positions of the power structure people from both sides. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of islamistic movement of the Hamas that has come to the power in sector Gaza in 2007, will be declared, from, the fact that they have forced Israel to retreat notwithstanding suffered by them losses. </seg>
<seg id="14">Notwithstanding the fact that some leaders of a group were destroyed, and the inhabitants are blocked with 1,7 million in one of the most populous and problem corners of our planet Israel hasn't succeeded in destroying the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="15">In fact the Hamas accrues its popularity on the West bank of the river Jordan - one more Palestinian territory, monitored currently by the more moderate movement of the Fatah. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More than that the leaders of the Hamas quite can draw a conclusion that the time works in them. </seg>
<seg id="17">The new influential and rich friends in the process of growth of influence of islamistic movements in the Arab world appear at the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="18">The regenerating regional the leader Turkey which long ago was the nearest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, has come forward with a support of the Hamas; its example, Qatar, has followed, one of richest and is dynamic developing states of the Persian gulf. </seg>
<seg id="19">The triumphing partisans of the Hamas declare the Hizballah about creation around Israel of an islamistic crescent - from Lebanon in the north in which the militarized group governs before Syria the in whom, still more are further before Jordan, where the authorities of the king are the proislamistic insurgents very soon will overthrow power Bashar Assada, and the allies of the Hamas threaten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The the most significant change of balance of forces has occurred in the region on the southern borders of Israel, in the itself populous and important Arab country, in Egypt where the influence of movement Fraternity-the Muslims with president Muhammed Mursi has hardened. </seg>
<seg id="21">Khosni Mubarak who governed Egypt during 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator that wasn't giving close attention to a support of the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="22">Brothers-Muslims conversely are an organization, in much similar to the Hamas, and their leaders are apter to populism. </seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic arrangements the Hamas can become a significant player whose voice even Israel and America won't succeed in choking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the same time the partisans of a "rigid" line in Israel will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="25">In a military sense the Hamas was plunged. </seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli antimissile system "the Iron dome" has justified expenditures for its creation and has successfully destroyed many of the rockets, launched by the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="27">The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least some is time. </seg>
<seg id="28">What concerns diplomacy the USA have remained faithful to their invariant position; many European countries have also laid guilt of the beginning of the last round of violence on the Hamas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">One more important factor is economic prosperity of Israel especially push forward the government Bin'yamina Netanyahu who to a significant extent ignored a peaceful process. </seg>
<seg id="30">Notwithstanding the fact that since 2004 approximately 30 Israelis have been killed from the rockets, launched from the territory of sector Gaza, Israel has succeeded in reducing the problem of the terrorists-kamikazes partly at the expense of the wall which enters the territory of the West bank of the river Jordan - the significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements which continue to be expanded notwithstanding illegality of such actions from a viewpoint of international legislation to the minimum. </seg>
<seg id="31">The position of prime minister Netanyahu, Likud whose party are within the framework of preparation for the election - have united with the conservatives, even more aggressively inclined, under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman planned for 22 January very comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="32">What sense to connive with the Palestinians and present the own state to them? </seg>
<seg id="33">If give back the whole power in the territory of the West bank into their arms won't they begin to launch a rocket from there to a side of Israel, as do their brothers in sector Gaza make it? </seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to keep them behind a wall and rigidly suppress any attempts to raise the heads. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the partisans of a "rigid" line will win a victory; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="36">The internal problems at the fact that the Islamists who come to the power in Egypt and other countries feel not the warmest emotions about Israel will become their priority task. </seg>
<seg id="37">The defense part of a budget of Israel is larger than that of its all Arab neighbours together taken. </seg>
<seg id="38">Untying of a war with a regional superpower hardly will help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen own economy. </seg>
<seg id="39">Pragmatism of the president of Egypt Mursi which jointly with Barak Obama worked on cessation of a fire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of changes with itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel to a not smaller extent must take long-term consequences of its policy into account. </seg>
<seg id="41">In the process of approach of democratic changes of the Arab countries deprivation of the Palestinians of self-determination right is the bomb of delayed action which early or late will explode in the occupied by Israel territories, like a bus, exploded in Tel Aviv in this week. </seg>
<seg id="42">The repressions already blow up fundamentals of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is growth of the Arab population - only aggravate these problems. </seg>
<seg id="43">For the bloody operations which are performed each several years in the territory of sector Gaza for suppression of movement of the Hamas one has to pay with growing discontent of the international community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need the external impulse </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Remains the sole solution for which tirelessly the sensible representatives from both sides, as well as the large part of the remaining world and our newspaper: formation of two states and concessions by Israel of the territories in exchange for security call. </seg>
<seg id="46">Hope, not too imposing in short-term prospect, - hope what cessation of a fire will allow other countries remain, it is more effective to influence the sides of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt is a for which long ago time to make decision to overlap deliveries of the weapons sector Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have an advantageous position to persuade the Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, accepted since the year 1967 of the one that considers exchange of the territories and joint use of Jerusalem, at its disposal as never. </seg>
<seg id="48">Other Arab countries also must make the efforts conciliation of movements of the Hamas and the Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="49">It would make more for creation of the Palestinian state than the forthcoming voting in the UN result of which confession virtual statehood of Palestine can become. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Also president Obama must play his role in the fact to seat Israel at a table of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he after all hasn't presented an own plan of peaceful settlement. </seg>
<seg id="52">After return from the White house he, as before, demonstrates unwillingness to switch to a solution of a given problem. </seg>
<seg id="53">It is a catastrophically shortsighted position. </seg>
<seg id="54">The united States are vitally interested in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="55">It is possible only in a case of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>

<seg id="1">In Australia the law of a unified package for the cigarettes has entered force. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The warnings about harm of smoking and the image of struck with the diseases of the parts of the body are contrastively allocated on the cheerless green boxes, similar for all trademarks of the cigarettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The first in world practice Australian law of a similar package of the cigarettes and the tobacco articles has entered into force, replacing the logotypes and the coloured finalization of the different trademarks the similar box of cheerless-olive colour of the eery photographs of the parts of the body, struck with a disease, and with the children's images, the health of which are blown up by smoking of their parents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Besides the different pictures and the inscriptions, warning the sole distinction between the packets of harm of smoking, brought in in an obligatory order from this Saturday - the name of the marks which are printed by the similar shallow font. </seg>
<seg id="5">It is the conditions of finalization of the packages of the tobacco articles, sternest in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia declares that it is aim of this measure to retain the youth smoking depriving this bad habit of the fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="7">Results of investigations that have shown that the people that haven't begun to smoke before 26 years in 99 cases from 100 so never also became the smokers have lain down into basis of such a solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"It is obvious that even at the youngest age the children understand the sense which the tobacco companies try to bring with the help of finalization of a package" -, health minister Tanya Plibersek explains refering to investigations that have shown that, for example the crown in a logotype associated itself with the children with the princess' idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries from least in the world of the smokers' shares, so that these changes not specially tell on the profit of the transnational corporations, also the different countries however consider the possibility of taking of similar measures already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The representatives of tobacco industry intensively counteracted acceptance of this law. </seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies assert that it only will increase a share of the black market on which the cheap and accessible cigarettes will sell themselves. </seg>
<seg id="12">"This law will have serious consequences, different from ones who were conceived by his originators" - Scott Makintajr, the representative of a company of British American Tobacco in Australia believes. </seg>
<seg id="13">The producers of false produce from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for a sale in the streets of Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For somebody conversely new laws contribute to growth of business. </seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Kha from the small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd assert that how the demand for the cigarette cases and the silicon etuis, concealing the disagreeable pictures on a package, swiftly, has grown (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies of British American Tobacco British Imperial Tobacco Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco has lost a case in a high court of Australia where tried to appeal against a given law. </seg>
<seg id="16">According to the words of Sandra Kha the company of Zico has already realized about six thousand articles of wholesale trade to the enterprises and expects a new batch. </seg>
<seg id="17">For us it is good business. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Popularity of social networks among just that part of the population on which these measures are directed is in the experts' opinion potential hindrance to effectiveness of similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="19">After acceptance in Australia of a series of laws that have made illegal TV advertisement of the cigarettes and a support by them of sports actions, as well as forbidding to the sellers to exhibit the cigarettes at a visible place advertisement of the tobacco articles has moved into the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="20">The government of Australia has forbidden to the local companies and the websites to locate advertisement on network, but it cannot restrict the foreign sites in it. </seg>
<seg id="21">"if *YOU* *VEND1* *tobacco* *ARTICLE1* *ALSO*/*EVEN1* *YOU* *HAVE* *ONLY1* this small *LOOP-HOLE*, *IDEA* *BE* *ADVANCE2*/*FURTHER* own *GOODS* on *INTERNET1* *SEEM* *YOU* extremely *tempting*", - *EXPLAIN* *bey* Friman, *INVESTIGATE*/*RESEARCH2* *QUESTION1* public/social *HEALTH* at *UNIVERSITY* *SYDNEY*. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman notes growth of the number of reviews of the trademarks, written from the face of allegedly the common users, how there is YouTube on the such social networks for twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="23">Does the question - whether this affair of the arms of the ordinary citizen who so likes cigarettes Marlboro that haven't pitied forces and the time and have made video, or does the advertising company stand behind it is actual arise? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Australian section on a company of British American Tobacco asserts that now more are occupied by adaptation to the new rules with a branch than advertisement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The representatives of tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsoring of the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for contestation of the new rules: these states make the complaint in the frames declaring that that trade has been subject to the world Trade organization unfair, the restrictions, notwithstanding the fact that trading relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant. </seg>
<seg id="26">The solution of WTO is expected to the middle of 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to the words of Tanya Plibersek the government discussed a possibility of acceptance by them of analogous laws of a package with other countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001 Canada introduced for the first obligatorily locating of the photographs, warning of harm of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="29">Now this rule is received in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of toughening of laws is considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The set of the smokers in Australia ostentatiously doesn't obey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures don't graze me. </seg>
<seg id="33">I just don't pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="34">"You just snatch away a cigarette and you hide a packet to a pocket" -, Victor El' Khejg, buying the cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor of the oral cavity on a packet, explains. </seg>
<seg id="35">It is honest saying the sole that can to make me throw - it is my small daughter. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">To miss in the world of electronic networks and the constants of wiring-ups - it is not so already is also bad. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this Day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport, because at our plane have transpired mechanical malfunctions and have replaced him with the other plane for which we also waited. </seg>
<seg id="3">Thus with me it was sufficient the time of reflections on nature of boredom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I shan't deceive you. </seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day in an airport in expectation of a trip is indeed boring, and here neither the books nor the magazines, nor an iPhone, nor even the magazines of duty-free trade strongly will help. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, in towards the last time still more scientists and the specialists children's development speak out in favour to boredom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in the definite situations for us and for our children not to miss so already is also bad. </seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain to abstract on the interesting adjacent themes, which perhaps contributes to creation. </seg>
<seg id="9">And since in the modern world we all permanently are in front of some screen, advantages of boredom pass by us. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Can it be for us necessary to strive boredom? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">And. </seg>
<seg id="12">And in the same time *ISN'T*. </seg>
<seg id="13">We shall return some more to it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Earlier I as also many believed that boredom was invention regarding recent times, when at the people appeared more free time. </seg>
<seg id="15">It is not so, asserts Peter Tui, the professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, the author of a book "the Fascinating history of boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History Yale University Press of 2011).. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact boredom can boast about very ancient history" -, he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls the Latin inscriptions, about boredom dated the first century, are detected in Pompeii. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In this case the question about that, as we understand boredom remains open. </seg>
<seg id="19">The problem in, John D.. speaks, Istvud what, understanding and vision of boredom are the adjunct-professor of the University York is in Ontario, Canada, often varied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Studying the materials of investigations into this theme and asking a question for the target group there is a person professor Istvud and his colleague in 100, send to the next definition: boredom - it when the people "want, but cannot deal with the fact that would give them satisfaction". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between boredom and apathy, he speaks, consists in the fact that the missing person doesn't make anything that would want to make. </seg>
<seg id="22">One doesn't want at apathy to do anything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main thing in experienced boredom, he, speaks, this "violation of attention and deterioration of mood and a feeling of the fact that the time stretches slowly, connected with it". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Over a description boredom can seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="25">However professor Istvud asserts that notwithstanding a possible connection between these states the missing people see the causes of the problems in the ambient world and circumstances, and the people experiencing depression, see the problems in himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">It seems that we feel boring, when in fact we find it just difficult on something to concentrate occasionally to us. </seg>
<seg id="27">In one's investigation "the Unoccupied mind: definition of boredom from a viewpoint of attention", professor Istvud, with the colleagues refer to the experiment, the published in September production of a magazine of Perspectives on Psychological Science carried out earlier, of which the participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The participants alone heard also the loud sounds of broadcast, included in a neighbouring room, not relating to an affair, other heard the same sounds on low of loudness, so that it hardly was possible to disassemble them, and the third group listened only to a recording of the voice without the outside sound track. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard the TV set with the low level of loudness noted, by what they felt boring more often than other - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn't know its cause and ascribed it to boredom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to concentrate attention in the difficult or fascinating task interruption of attention can cause boredom, Marc Dzh.. Fenske, the adjunct-professor of neurology at the University of *GVEL'F*, Ontario, and one of the authors of given investigation speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we make anything uninteresting, "for example scrutinizing a stream of the articles on a conveyor in search for defect distracting music can help to avoid boredom". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is believed, he continues, that when the people begin to rock on a chair or draw scribble on a sheet of paper, they make it from boredom, however now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The investigation has shown that the children who *ISN'T* forbidden to dodge about and revolve, study better and memorize more information than the children which require to sit quietly" -, professor Fenske asserts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">At some moments we all test boredom: in the delay of a trip (as in my case), listening to monotonic speech, viewing an uninteresting film. </seg>
<seg id="35">However the different people demonstrate the different degree of inclination for boredom. </seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980th years for measurement of such individual peculiarities the researchers developed a special "scale of inclination for boredom". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The questions and, for example, "Much from the fact that I have to make assertion, monotonously and monotonously" or, "is too much interesting therefore there isn't enough for Me time anything" are used for definition of estimation by such a scale. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The with the help of such questionaries, the researchers have defined that the boys miss as more frequent than the girls, - Steven Vodanovich, the professor of psychology at the University of the Western Florida, - says especially push forward, presence of the versatile external irritants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However on the whole the teenagers in general often miss. </seg>
<seg id="40">There is Reed Larson in 1991, the professor of personality and public development at the University of Illinois, has carried out the experiment in the process of which he communicated almost with 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times per day with the help of a pager. </seg>
<seg id="41">He has received the next results: 32 % of teenagers have declared the fact that they feel boring is at a school and during execution of homework, and 23 % have declared the fact that they feel boring is beyond the limits of the school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In this case only 3 % of parents have noted that they feel boring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson notes that he hasn't data which similar data on boredom would be now after 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="44">However he knows that "on adolescent age falls a peak of inclination for boredom" in the main thing, because the children and the teenagers aren't allowed in the full measure to decide they must with what start to deal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Shall we return to my initial question: boredom is useful? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Occasionally isn't, because in the extreme manifestations she, as investigations show, can push the people from absurd and dangerous in physical actions, the venturous gambling games or abuse of the definite substances in attempts to get rid of boredom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand many philosophers and the writers pondered a connection between boredom and creation, professor Vodanovich that has dedicated to study of this problem more than two decades speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"So our brain prompts us that it is necessary to start to deal with something else; it also is boredom" - Gary Markus, the professor of psychology at the New York university speaks. </seg>
<seg id="49">However not always know this most brain, is with what just better to start to deal. </seg>
<seg id="50">If you will feel boring, and you will direct this energy on a game at a guitar or culinary experiments, you will make for yourselves better. </seg>
<seg id="51">However if you begin to see the TV set you will feel better only for some time, and soon it will elapse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Therefore if your child misses, and you give an iPad to him he will stop missing, however he won't learn to struggle with boredom independently or somehow the other mode control his time and occupancy -, professor Fenske speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"And such skills in independent adjustment are used for the most different situations" -, he asserts. </seg>
<seg id="54">Your child studies not only independently to occupy himself with something, he also studies the *SELF1* control in general. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that to extoll boredom is necessary somehow. </seg>
<seg id="56">It however isn't worth counting her in anything bad too. </seg>
<seg id="57">It rather is necessary to study to feel comfortably even beyond a continuous stream of actions and technologies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Istvud agrees on it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We see it is so that it is for us necessary to more often test boredom at the fact that to start to deal with something meaningful - is the boredom is extremely disagreeable strong wish", he speaks. </seg>
<seg id="60">In fact the people strive somehow tune out great cares and just relax. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In the modern world we have got accustomed to permanent excessive stimulation of the organs of emotions -, he - speaks, and when silence, sets up, we get lost and we don't know that make". </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">It is so far unclear how the new law of legalization of marihuana in the state of Colorado will apply </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orosko, the nineteen year-old player of the football team and a student of a public college in the south-east of the state of Colorado is accused of committing of criminal crime, consisting in the fact that it soon will be perfectly lawful in the whole territory of the state: storage of the small portion of marihuana and the tube in which he smoked her. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Orosko says that once in September he was with the friends into Lamare and went by automobile over a prairie near the border with Kansas, when them stopped the policemen. </seg>
<seg id="4">After the policeman has detected marihuana in a machine Mr Orosko, summons to a court has come for storage of the drugs and possession of gadget use of the drugs - shallow delicts for each of which, a fine into is due the size of 100 dollars - and the date of the judicial session is appointed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"One handles as with the criminals - us", Mr Orosko speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But is he the criminal? </seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the ambiguity which continues already several weeks after the state of Colorado has voted for legalization of use of marihuana in small quantities for entertainment, the solution of hundreds of shallow judicial affairs doesn't depend so much from a law how much from a place of consideration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Accusations of shallow delicts, connected with marihuana, film in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington which has taken analogous measure already. </seg>
<seg id="9">The police areas have already stopped making accusations of the the people age are 21 years and are older for storage of small doses, which will come to be believed lawful, once across a couple of weeks the law will enter force, old. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In the more conservative districts of Colorado the prosecutors have however made a decision to consider the existing cases, connected with marihuana, and over previous make responsible for storage of this drug. </seg>
<seg id="11">In the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain districts of the West is voted for the fact not to allow appearance in their places, new, licensed by the state of the magazines over a sale of marihuana. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All of it develops so swiftly that I even don't know what to expect further" -, Daniel Dzh.. Outs speaks, the head of the police, there is Aurora in the east of Denver in the small town. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The representatives of the monitoring organs in the state of Washington too perplexed scratch the heads. </seg>
<seg id="14">They are in for forming of the rules for definition, about licensing of breeding, treatment, dissemination, both are the sales of marihuana, and to all of it make before 1 December 2013 is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, it is or it is bad good outpaces the majority of other states settlement of the questions of marihuana use at first in medical aims, and now for entertainment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"There is a more ordered market in Colorado, therefore they will serve as a good example" -, Bryan I.. Smith, the representative of the council for adjustment of production and a sale of alcoholic produce in the state of Washington explains. </seg>
<seg id="17">But now nobody can make more, Mr Smith recognizes, than make some offers and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="18">"We haven't real precedent to which we would be able to orientate - oneself", he speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Bill of the state of Washington I-502, is named, will enter force 6 December and for the entire year will plunge the state in state of ambiguity, when of the system, there is no state-licensing more, and the right of marihuana possession is legitimated already. </seg>
<seg id="20">And exist however not the else simple technical aspects is to which necessary solve in this period, for example as find equilibrium between an order of the state "for adequate access" to licensed marihuana with a ban on her trade at the distance of 1000 ft from the schools, the parks, the playing platforms and the kindergartens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It will be especially complicated to locate the licensed enterprises of marihuana trade in a line of the cities in particular in Seattle and its suburbs" -, Ben Livingston, the representative of the recently formed research group "Center of marihuana legalization" explains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November the head of the police Outs sent a message of the fact that the prosecutor's office of the city more won't make the faces that have been at the age of 21 years responsible for possession of the small quantity of marihuana, and that the police stop proving the people guilty of given violations "beginning with this moment" from Aurora to his subordinates by an e-mail. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The head of the police Outs has reported that the police will watch observance in the city of the rules, adjusting activity of the faces, breeding marihuana in medical aims, and will pursue the illegal dealers and the spreaders of the drugs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The prosecutor of a district of Ueld in the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a stricter approach to this question. </seg>
<seg id="25">After a voting over a bill he has declared that the prosecutor's office will make as before responsible for possession of marihuana in the main way to impel her using persons to study course for treatment. </seg>
<seg id="26">At a given moment accusations of storage against two and ounces of marihuana, are although many of them are accused also of other violations less are made 119 faces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"It is duty of our institution to pursue for the actions which are believed criminal at a moment of of them accomplishment" -, Mr Tank in the declaration has said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reaction was ambiguous even in such places as Mesa rural district where the participants of a voting have refused offer of marihuana legalization. </seg>
<seg id="29">The police Grandee Dzhankshn more don't make the largest city in a district responsible the adults for possession of the small quantity of drug. </seg>
<seg id="30">District prosecutor Pete Khauttsinger has supported this solution, but has also decided not to drop accusations in even the open affairs, connected with storage of marihuana. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I believe that to insure observance of a law, until it varies is our direct duty" -, he speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Notwithstanding the fact that 55 % of inhabitants of the state are Colorado, this solution, inclusion of the questions of use of marihuana for entertainments into the state and legal system have supported having taken part in a voting won't be simple. </seg>
<seg id="33">And the inhabitants' contradictory reaction in the different places of the state has stripped ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to experiment of the state with marihuana. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The cultural barrier - with the district prosecutors exists, explains Sean McAllister, the Denver lawyer, awaking the convicts' interests for storage of marihuana, and the local representative of the National organization of reformation of laws over marihuana, in this question". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They so long prosecuted the people for it, that now cannot really reconcile oneself with that that it *BE* already not the crime" -, he speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington - the first states in which the marihuanas relate to small quantity as as to alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in a scale of the country for a checkup of the idea of legalization of the drugs itself. </seg>
<seg id="37">The partisans of legalization and the officials of the state, it is planned to expand the territory of legalized trade, but in the same time, they with caution expect indications from federal the authorities which are as before, volplane to consider a sale and breeding of marihuana as federal crimes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The partisans of marihuana legalization hope that the Control will be inferior to justice in this question. </seg>
<seg id="39">The federal government in the majority of the cases has given notwithstanding several arrests of the dealers and the patients that have received wide resonance being using marihuana over the medical testimonies for trade in marihuana in medical aims in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states kindly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The agents of a Bureau of struggle with the drugs hardly will break in into the houses to confiscate small the small package the marihuanas, however they hardly will begin to close the eyes with the shops, adjusted by the authorities of the state, which resolved according to a new law, Kevin A.. Sabet, the former adviser on the questions of struggle with the drugs in the administration of Obama believes, of recreational marihuana. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Any cities in Colorado wouldn't wait for actions of the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="42">Before the presidential election yet some local administrations have approved of a moratorium on the discovery of the new shops over a sale of marihuana which also so wouldn't be able to open earlier than in a year. </seg>
<seg id="43">The *of_six_months*/*six-month* ban on marihuana trade which in all probability will be approved in the next week in the last week of Montrouz put forward consideration the city in the western part of the state. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to turn out in such a position that we shall give to somebody a license, and then it will cause the serious problems at the federal level" -, Bob Nikolson, the member of the urban council speaks. </seg>
<seg id="45">Our city has voted against this correction. </seg>
<seg id="46">Contradiction between results of the local voting and that for what the state has voted also now with us is evident. </seg>
<seg id="47">Else very many unsolved questions remain. </seg>

<seg id="3">How much I remember myself, I always dreamt about entering the *Oxford* university. </seg>
<seg id="4">My father and the elder brother studied in Oxford and described him as the training institution, best in the world, the modern analog of ancient symposium, laying two fundamentals of a civilization, is free thinking and is tolerance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless after two weeks of learning of the historical faculty Vusterskogo of the college of the Oxford university at the end of the eightieth, I have packed the suitcases and have left, which has poured out into the first real scandal in my life. </seg>
<seg id="6">My father hasn't withstood and has begun to weep. </seg>
<seg id="7">The friends were muddled up. </seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper of The Evening Standard asserted that I had given up a college, because I haven't liked that my classmates make love in a neighbouring room. </seg>
<seg id="9">The writer E.. Northman Wilson joked that I had left, because I had to drink from the chippy cups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In fact everything was not so amusing. </seg>
<seg id="11">I have run down. </seg>
<seg id="12">Yes have run down because I was systematically hunted down and intimidated. </seg>
<seg id="13">Quite not because of my enough unusual name or the fact that I studied at a private school. </seg>
<seg id="14">I was hunted down only for one cause, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it looked real barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, the now deceased Vudro Uajett, were known adviser Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was the conservatives' partisan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Will you ask what for to to recollect it now? </seg>
<seg id="16">According to the latest data the new generation of the students, sticking to right-centrist glances, is subject to the the same baiting. </seg>
<seg id="17">This institutionalized and permanently growing hate for students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that in the last week the group of such students required the same protection of its rights as one who presents himself to the invalids for sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The conservatives from the student club of the college Building of Christie in Cambridge declare that they "often actively isolate them, subject to the personal assaults and make feel like the unwished guests" because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="19">They want to bring in an additional representative to a committee for equal rights of the college to insure freedom of expression of their opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation has only aggravated a 2 documentary film about the politician in student medium "Country of the miracles: young, clever and right" in whom the conservatives have been represented as the eccentrics and the neo-Nazis, having gone out recently to BBC. </seg>
<seg id="21">In a film Joe Cook, the former president of an Association of the conservatives of the Oxford university which rides in Rolls-Royce, wears the silver suit and a walking-stick with the silver knob was shown. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities students-conservatives complain that they make "the goats of absolution because of an increase of pay for learning" of them. </seg>
<seg id="23">The hatch of Blek of 20 years, the vice-president of an Association of the conservatives of the Nottingham university in an interview of one of the Sunday newspapers have said that "in university medium skewness to a side of the left glances increases. </seg>

<seg id="26">"It is threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, and just the normal life of the members of the club" -, she speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">I was the first several weeks in Oxford not just in minority, I was alone. </seg>
<seg id="28">I entered there in September 1986 by the timid and shy of eighteen girl. </seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford had fever from hate for the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="30">In a year before it the university by the voting deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of reduction of the budget allotments for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere it would be comfortless even the Stalinists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of freshman week when the students get acquainted with each other and the teachers I for the first time felt that had expected me ahead. </seg>
<seg id="33">I haven't known that the teachers not only saw through the fingers baiting of students-conservatives, but with pleasure took in it part oneself yet. </seg>

<seg id="36">"Miss Uajett -, teacher the now late Harry Pitt - has said, please, translate the first paragraph". </seg>
<seg id="37">The text yielded me with difficulty, I stumbled. </seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was a very bilious person with the face, similar to a cake. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Doesn't Tetcheristy fundamentally teach to the French, or aren't - there enough for them just the brains" has he asked.? </seg>
<seg id="40">Other students have chuckled. </seg>
<seg id="41">With me the tears on the eyes have appeared. </seg>
<seg id="42">"I advise on you to take several initial lessons on the French in the free time if you, of course, aren't occupied revolving in a society - Pitt has grumbled very much". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I have returned to my room of perfectly miserable. </seg>
<seg id="44">In that evening in a college I sat behind lunch alone; then somebody patted me on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, the student of the second course from a faculty of the English language which has seemed as a member of an Association of the conservatives of the university. </seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who are you - he has said friendly. </seg>
<seg id="47"> -Regretfully the affair is in a following way: </seg>
<seg id="48">Over each who is suspected of sympathies to the conservatives, will mock. </seg>
<seg id="49">It is for me myself uneasy, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore you will find it more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="50">The majority of the freshmen-conservatives pretend that they are the labourists". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in a local pub I cowardly tried to dissemble. </seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted on the fact that agree not on everything that Margaret Thatcher speaks. </seg>
<seg id="53">The cunning hasn't proved possible. </seg>
<seg id="54">The freshman of the faculty of philosophy, policy and economy which studied itself in Eton has said: "You are the fascist pig's daughter. </seg>

<seg id="63">Shall I be forced to conceal physique lejboristkoj and my real convictions? </seg>
<seg id="64">The forthcoming me three years have begun to seem hell, full of persecutions and solitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Norman, the stone, the professor of modern history were the sole teacher in my college that wasn't concealing their conservative views. </seg>
<seg id="66">He was hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but for the fact that he was adviser Thatcher on the questions of foreign policy and one of her speechwriters. </seg>
<seg id="67">He practically didn't appear in a college. </seg>
<seg id="68">He despised him provincialism, meanness and adherence to Marxist-deterministic glance at history. </seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he received professorial job at the university Bilkent in Ankara Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you won't be happy" -, he has told me. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I have begun to ride to Oxford from a parental house in London trying to find refuge among the kinsmen and the open-minded metropolitan friends. </seg>
<seg id="72">I have told the father that I hate Oxford and have explained a cause. </seg>
<seg id="73">He me didn't come to believe. </seg>
<seg id="74">During its learning in the forties any political views there were received. </seg>
<seg id="75">"But for it is the best university in the world -, he has said pitifully. </seg>
<seg id="76"> -There not capable of such only not in the city of the napping spires… </seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends-communists always behaved irreproachably". </seg>
<seg id="78">His humid eyes have grown turbid. </seg>
<seg id="79">"Don't make the wrong decisions. </seg>

<seg id="81">You will break me the heart if you throw the university". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was tired out by the constants for the journeys to London and washing emotional protection weakened. </seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also the conservative, haven't withstood pressure and have given up their convictions. </seg>
<seg id="84">In the next week during the seminar, when the next teacher of history perfectly seriously named me "the enemy of a people" I decided to act as. </seg>
<seg id="85">In a shower burning shame I have confessed that "the parents have washed for me the brains", have also named them "the old fools". </seg>

<p>
<seg id="86">The respite was short. </seg>
<seg id="87">Into a lid of the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to nail up the last nail for my father. </seg>
<seg id="88">In that time he wrote each week in two columns for editions, belonging to *Rupert* Murdoch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="90">I didn't go out, and after five minutes my persecutors have given in. </seg>
<seg id="91">When they went away I have packed a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="92">I after all haven't returned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can name me the cry-baby and a rag. </seg>
<seg id="94">But into eighteen years nobody must become an object of such a fury and intimidations in the training institution. </seg>
<seg id="95">It is in that sadder that it was Oxford which has not only let out the Tory's, fourteen prime ministers but till this day hides behind an undeserved reputation of the university in which the equality and free thinking are appreciated. </seg>

<seg id="1">The heaviest profession is in the world: the miners from Kavakh-Idzhena </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros the Indonesian miners risk life and health bringing in 70 kilograms of sulphur on apex of the volcano over the steep stony paths </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people, for which their work is hell, and other literally work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="4">Which among them Anto Vidzhajya earn one of the 400 miners for life with extraction of sulphur in volcano Kavakh-Idzhen, situated in the east of Indonesian island Java. </seg>
<seg id="5">Each day Anto descends to a most bottom of the crater, where sulphureous gas, rising from the depths of the earth, congeals at contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="6">Hackling the huge pieces of sulphur of which the common weight can equal 70 kilograms he puts them to two bamboo baskets, shoulders the baskets the shoulders and carries them upward along a precipitous stony road. </seg>
<seg id="7">Before apex of the volcano the height of which equals 2.386 metres, only only 250 metres, by the emaciated heavers is however required more than 40 minutes to rise by tortoise step with difficulty retaining equilibrium and cautiously fumbling with a road not to misstep and not fall from breakage. </seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one wrong step can cost them life as it has happened to one tourist from France which fell from rocks Kavakh-Idzhena several years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The miners from Kavakh-Idzhena earn 5 Euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur which is obtained </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Turning out at the top they lay themselves a road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were the monkeys from a circus, and, wearily carrying the heavy baskets, three kilometres to the weights, which the mineral resource company has aligned slightly higher, at the height of 1.850 metres march. </seg>
<seg id="11">The speech suits about PT Kandi Ngrimbi the enterprise which exploits the Indonesian rupees are approximately like 1960 not to also say, this volcano the year is and better its employees to whom it pays 662 (5 Euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells him for 10.000 rupees (83 Euro cents), however this mineral to petrochemical productions, is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of the matches, fireworks, *COSMETICS*, dynamite and even for bleaching of sugar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"For norm is portage of 70 kilograms we earn about 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) behind each *KHODKA*" -, explain to us Anto, which usually executes three daily portages. </seg>
<seg id="14">He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels like broken, however they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of day. </seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems *MIZER* for such a superhuman effort it is three times larger than the fact that it would earn in a floor. </seg>
<seg id="16">"Char pay to the miners is very high by the local measures where 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros) in a day are paid for collection of coffee, and the the average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)" -, a heaver explains, which earlier worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="17">There its salary reached 75.000 rupees (6,2 euros) in a day, and the area wasn't so heavy, but Anto has returned with its family in Ban'yuvangi, the small town is not far from a volcano, for the weighty cause which in Indonesia is the the same crushing as sulphur: "YA married a girl with Bali where the Hinduists alone are and have brought her to Java, so that it receives Islam". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At Anto asthma, he breathes with difficulty, permanently coughs, and with it the eyes tear because of toxic gas </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Into the 27 years Anto has spent three years risking himself into Kavakh-Idzhene whose sulphur has already begun to tell on it notwithstanding the presence of the mask and the special spectacles. </seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, permanently coughs, and with it the eyes tear because of the toxic gas which a volcano secretes. </seg>
<seg id="21">It is the price which it must pay for achievement of its dream. </seg>
<seg id="22">"I shall work two more years, because I want to open a shop or study the Spanish or is French" -, he promises on more than acceptable, English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The pleasant and clever young man, punished with life, this, would be able to be the tourist guide, the waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead of it he does the mule's work. </seg>
<seg id="24">Dividing a dirty wooden hut into other porters he rises each day per two hours of night, because sulphur doesn't stop leaking out over the nights, when its characteristic yellow colour converts into blue and shines among gloom. </seg>
<seg id="25">Being a challenge to shadows Anto descends to a crater illuminating a road to oneself with a small lantern, which he himself has bought connected with his helmet on the money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters drag the baskets with sulphur on the shoulders from a bottom of the volcano </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Notwithstanding high profits the mineral resource company didn't mechanize extraction of sulphur for economy of expenditures and don't grant any equipment to the porters who work on its bill and with such deprivations. </seg>
<seg id="28">In fact they don't receive even the part from 30.000 rupees (2,5 euros) of the collection for photography which together with the input ticket is for 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of this reserve collect from the tourists who come to photograph a volcano and his people-mules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work for the cattle, and not for the people" -, Badrusin declares, the dumpy porter of 42 years which has spent three decades on Kavakh-Idzhene since has abandoned a college. </seg>
<seg id="30">Capable of raising up to 110 kilograms he assures that he will tolerate work "so much how much will be able" because money on education of its three children at the age from 18 to 10 years is for it necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I shan't go away on pension, I shall die here, because the volcano is whole my life </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense posts of smoke, going out from a volcano, they are so strong that not one doesn't complain about their severe diseases…, the obviously, habitual problems, more serious than them, of breath, arthrosis, pains are in the knees and ulcers are on the shoulders which deformed under the weight of the baskets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing a basket on the back Unajnik now only can raise 50 kilograms per the 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="34">Each day he and his companions take out 15 tons of sulphur from a volcano which transport three lorries to a magazine into Tamansari overcoming the distance of 18 kilometres over a narrow path among the thickets. </seg>
<seg id="35">"I shan't go away on pension, I shall die here, because the volcano is whole my life" -, Unajnik declares widely opening the mouth, in which don't grasp at several teeth. </seg>
<seg id="36">From his five children, senior, 30 years too work the carrier of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="37">The time passes, but poverty perpetuates from a generation into a generation one of the heaviest studies in the world: one that is dealt the human mules from Kavakh-Idzhena. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried to make much, for example, realize a launching of the spirits with the pheromones or organize the parties of quick acquaintances (the blitz-rendezvous). </seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas perhaps were creative, but have unobligingly worked. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">Who not perceives it so thoughtlessly is a government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="17">It spends 1.300 US dollars in a year on policy for inspiration of the citizens on birth of the *greater* number of children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The state package for married couples and the parents grants up to 15.000 dollars for a child, extends leaves over pregnancy and also provides the kinds with tax benefits. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is, also the rich and high technology state-city in the South-eastern Asia famous for conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The level of birthrate in Singapore, according to its national administration of the population is at the level of 1,2 children on a woman currently. </seg>
<seg id="22">The last time he was below 2 - what is known as percent of replacement - in 1976. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes of social norms contribute to growth of the number of bachelors and storage of marriages and the children's, birth, as a result of which, the level of birthrate in Singapore has gone down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the meantime the immigrational policy which is directed on a considerable increase of immigration for confrontation with reduction of the population causes perturbation among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="28">There in Singapore are websites where the hardly concealed xenophobia with respect to many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticized for maintenance of salaries at the low level and unwillingness to be integrated prospers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the causes of the fact that in the last year the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in an election since times of independence. </seg>
<seg id="30">There was attempt to solve a problem, with the help of quotes and more than high taxes for the foreign workers after the election. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments of the area of 46 square metres very well sell themselves. </seg>
<seg id="37">There nevertheless is opinion that they can contribute to an idle lifestyle and deprive the developers who want to build the large family dwelling of a stimulus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lima YU. Put, general director of the house building, the companies EL Developers, says that their "footwear boxes" much quicker than the more spacious specimens sell themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular in that sense, which such apartments will be snapped up several days even weeks quicker than an apartment of *greater* size. </seg>
<seg id="40">As its result, our money-entering increases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless he recognizes that new norms give the clearer orientators for the developers in whom earlier obstacles placed if they wanted to propose too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too overstrained </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is the city-state. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules can be step in a direction of an increase of national birthrate, after a talk with the Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center it seems that they won't have special effect. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="45">"The people are overstrained very much, the dwelling is expensive also as also the formation, and because of it many people put - it aside", a young manager speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have the children. </seg>
<seg id="47">"But it is important for me to have the own money and the time - at one's disposal", the other young man of 20 years speaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The men and the women mention their career, stress and the prices of a dwelling and formation as the causes which hamper them in acquiring the children. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the words of the specialist to speculate their the most effective mode which make such show that confidentiality the children and the teenagers, - to ask the questions is. </seg>
<seg id="48">"To tell them that they didn't make it is useless" -, she adds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Does Porras then list any versions: are there things which you wouldn't tell the stranger, why do you so make it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="50">Or, would you like if photography had been published you like one that have published you about your friend? </seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know that other publish about you? </seg>

<seg id="53">And to one, more know, is for all necessary, what do you do at each moment? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">One more point - it allow them understand that they must behave the on-line mode as as is made, it is the off-line mode. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Korrea which participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of the south American nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, has declared state television of Peru that the Europeans "killed each other during the Second world war", and in other collisions, "they are however now practically one fatherland". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">He protected in this context the project of an establishment of the south American citizenship of which the countries-participants UNASUR approve. </seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to attain free movement of the citizens and working over any south American country, how it already happens to the members of the Andes community, but there hitherto are reactionary sectors which want to return us to the past" - he has warned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Ecuadorian president has revealed himself besides that by the partisan of a resumption of an Organization of the American states (*OAS*) under a prerequisite of decrease in influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and acceptance into attention of ones who have signed a Pact of San Jose of human rights. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Ones who give talks never take on no obligations on themselves, and we, the south Americans, conversely, sign everything. </seg>
<seg id="8">"Inexplicably what inter-American the commission for human rights will walk enough in Washington also is financed by the United States" -, he has declared hinting at political refuge, given by Ecuador to founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Korrea has assured that don't regret this solution, because with it he didn't betray the principles, but observed the "deep values of democracy and human rights". </seg>
<seg id="10">He has added that "there were definite suspicions of the fact that Assange will be extradited to the third country, and a process won't be observed" in his time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He has criticized besides that, the Swedish justice is for a requirement to come to its territory for interrogation concerning supposed crime while there is "the Swedish legislation itself on the sexual soil, believe possible to realize him by, to make with the embassy of Ecuador in London was of which is for the video conference possible". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Korrea has confirmed that risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange exists. </seg>
<seg id="13">"Me not said from by him since he has come to our embassy, but, the ambassador has reported to me that at him, a small pulmonary problem, the Ecuadorian head of the state has said, was, nothing serious" -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">What indeed is is danger of deterioration of its physical and mental health because of incarceration in small space without a possibility to do exercises on air. </seg>
<seg id="15">"It influences any person's - health", he has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Korrea has specified that a solution of the problem of refuge, granted to Assange from June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by allocation of a guarantee of the inviolability which will allow him to go to Ecuador, are in the arms of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs and have emphasized that negotiations in London on search for a solution of the problem of incarceration of the founder WikiLeaks were. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We don't conduct negotiations on human rights, we don't use this word for a given case, but permanent discussions were. </seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution of this problem is found in the arms of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs, because the lawyer of Assange, Bal'tasar *GARSON* leads a series of the processes in the different European instances" - he has mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And have expressed opinion that "if Great Britain tomorrow gives a guarantee of inviolability it will end". </seg>
<seg id="20">Also if how Sweden her beautifully allows her legislation, and how she has already made in other cases, will interrogate seigneur Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or will interrogate him Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Korrea has used a case to reveal oneself as a defender of print freedom and has emphasized that don't tolerate "a mediocrity, the unconscientiousness and lie which distorts freedom of expression". </seg>
<seg id="22">"The main enemies of print freedom, he has said it is not the perverse villains-politicians, but are the bad journalists, supporting profit, blackmail and extortion" -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He has remained glad that more narrowly neither these journalists "nor are the bankers, nor the bourgeois countries-hegemons don't reign in Ecuador" from this aspect and has added that being reelected "will deepen a revolution for continuation of development in a true direction". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Korrea has also supported a decision to keep veto of Paraguay into UNASUR at least before the next election substantiating it with the fact that an organization "have to be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a support of upheavals under a mask of legality", because in reality "it has destroyed legality of Paraguayan democracy". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Ecuadorian president has believed besides that "perfectly reasonable" a wish of his Columbian colleague of Juan Manuel Santosa to conduct negotiations with Nicaragua on the sea borders between two countries after the solution of the International court of justice of the Hague which has turned out in favour to Nicaraguan sea sovereignty now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For a given moment this solution isn't observed. </seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between the south American and the central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="28">The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome by the wish to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="29">It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and continue to move ahead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also he has voiced hope for good termination of the argument on the sea boundaries which is held in the same court of Peru and Chile, and has voiced, which "is correct for the Latin America to appeal to the international instances if two countries pledge to make a decision however heavy it was". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Concerning a possibility to act as as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run on the third term in succession, he has indicated that he considers this possibility "with large optimism and joy, although occasionally it is enough heavy". </seg>
<seg id="32">Korrea has assured that if lose in an election in February 2013 then will give public life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In a personal plan I have been never interested in the power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social-economic poverty can be corrected only on the part of the political power. </seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement has believed that just I guaranteed this probable victory, so that one has to recognize this responsibility" -, he has said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In a case of a victory it would become my last term in the president's job, and then we go out from public life. </seg>
<seg id="36">If the same loses. </seg>
<seg id="37">He has confirmed "this solution" -. </seg>
<seg id="38">Korrea has also mentioned new course for treatment of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have just said with Venezuelan vice-president Nicholas Maduro, which have told me that he departed on the routine treatment which has already been planned, and that it is expected that it will pass a campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="40">"It doesn't mean aggravation of state of the health of president Chavez" -, he has explained. </seg>

<seg id="1">Taking ratification by the appellate court of the United States of a solution into account which annuls restructurization of debt of the Group of Vitro, reached by competitive production in Mexico, the script sets fatal precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country which has the problems of solvency. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems that the procedures in a support of survival of the companies which are permitted by Mexican laws aren't actual in a country of the bands and the stars, in contradiction with the international agreements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In a practical sphere approval of a decision, made on 15 June by judge Kharlin Hale in a court of bankruptcies of the northern district of Texas, leaves defenseless the Mexican companies in front of a possibility of an imposition of an arrest on their property on that side of Rio Grande. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However the decree opens the doors for the leading producer of a glass in Mexico for appeal to the Supreme court of the United States leading three mismatches into a proof. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">As entry, while the judge of an affair notes that the creditors must be adjusted by the Code of the USA about bankruptcy the Appellate court of the fifth district, situated in the New Orleans, says that the basic trial concerns competitive production, considered in Mexico. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point means cancellation of international judicial cooperation in the cases of insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact Type law of the UN over a unification of right of international trade with this aim was created defining as a referee the American institute of right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly the verdict establishes that without an intercompany voting, restructurizations the indebtednesses, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production, which had in front of a maternal company branches Vitro, majority, necessary for assertion, weren't reached are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Mexican laws nevertheless recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="10">In fact Vitro wasn't the first case, when this scheme is received. </seg>
<seg id="11">Half a dozen of examples is among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose intercompany debts the Federal institute of competitive productions guaranteed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is true, also also the fact that subtracting the voices of branches, it is anyway is the creditors Vitro who struggled against him in the courts of the United States namely the funds "the vultures" like Aurelios Capital Aurelios Convergencia Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, wouldn't reach majority. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The voting would be 45 percent against 37. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Appellate court omits these data. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand he accuses Vitro in the complicated situation with which the one has collided beginning since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis which has overtaken the United States delivering the blows at a country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">As long as what the company of the family Gonzalez of the Garden shows, the appeal against a solution into is the appellate court, itself that the voting has reached his plenum, i.e., five judges in view of the fact that only three have been voted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In a case of a failure the intercession for the certificate which will require revision of a process on the part of the court of the supreme instance, in a given case of the Supreme court of the United States will be shown. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Worst of all the fact that the court has rejected a document, directed by the government of Mexico in a role amicus curiae ("the friend of a court") in which the process which should Vitro within the framework of Law of competitive productions, signaling the fact that he releases itself from observance of the agreements, signed by both countries to connect with an article of Law 15 of the USA of bankruptcy, is described, she. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It besides that is noted that the country has been subordinated to the principles of the Commission of the Organization of the Combined Nations for international trade, i.e., the rules, introduced for the cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for the debtors and the creditors. </seg>

<seg id="1">Hector "of Khetin" Rejes: "the Basketball was my life" </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Inveterate basketball traveller Hector "of Khetin" Rejes was more than 60 years connected with this sport and, due to it, has maneged the whole world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico bear so many basketball stories, as Hector "of Khetin" Rejes in the memory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And however before than the haemorrhage from the brain has enchained him to an invalid carriage in 2008, Rejes was immersed into sport during more than 60 years, as a player small categories, the player the Supreme basketball league, the representative and the leader BSN and Cowboys Bayamona and the president of a Federation of basketball. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I executed many roles in basketball over a distance of my life, including somewhat simultaneously how when I was president BSN, the general director of the National team and the president of a federation in the 90th years" -, Rejes during a visit of Primera Hora to him recollects home where in Bayamon he lives in my faithful spouse from Isabel', over a distance more of 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="6">"The basketball was my life". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Rejes doesn't exaggerate making this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="8">Walls of its house almost all, decorated with the photographs and the memorable things, gathered behind its long way, testify to it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamon in the heart </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the greatest emotions he stores that which remember his way across the Cowboys beginning with the middle of the 50th years as a player before the year, 1982 when accomplished 15 years of his departure into the roles from-an agent or an agent of a contract. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"It was my best years which I enjoyed most of all, because had a possibility to be the part of the eight championships of the Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, from-an agent or a leader. </seg>
<seg id="12">Five championships that have passed approximately 1971 were many years of joy, including till 1975. </seg>
<seg id="13">And afterwards I said goodbye to one in the year, 1981 per year of debut of Jerome Minsi into BSN. </seg>
<seg id="14">From that moment also henceforth to lead has begun "Kuko" Ortis, which was the great manager" -, Rejes has specified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Ginas *Bart* which started here and was, at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), have told me: "I for you have a very strong player in growth 6' 7". </seg>
<seg id="16">"Do you want"? </seg>
<seg id="17">And it was Minsi beginning one of the best players whom Puerto Rico had. </seg>
<seg id="18">Then recommended *Bart*, sniper Raymond Gaussa, who has received citizenship has also become one of our best bombardiers. </seg>
<seg id="19">Me I remember that have said that if Minsi has brought championship Bayamonu has helped to conquer Gauss one more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">I have enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys and Gauss, but already at distance, because by 1988 have already appeared the head of a federation. </seg>
<seg id="21">To that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements of Minsi in a national team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember, as we have won for the first time from the USA during an olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="23">Then the world Championship of the year, 1990 on which we have received the fourth place and came, it had to be bronze if *would*, not that Canadian judge, who has made us outplay a final game, Rejes has said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">That command from the world Championship of 1990 is the best picked team which you have ever seen? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What she among best as also one has won from Dream Team on the Olympic games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="26">But one, was, which from the Pan-American games at Cuba in 1991 when we won, my favourite, gold has also broken the national team of the USA which was enough similar to one who has won bronze in world championship from us. </seg>
<seg id="27">In that command Minsi not only again played Gauss, *Ramon* Rivasa Fiko Lopez and' Pikulina' (Ortisa), but, whom also young (Xavier)' Ton'ito' Colon and James Karter, brothers Leon (Fransisko and Edgar) and Mario' Kikhote' Morales couldn't participate in the year 90 because of injury of the knee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The command which perhaps, was not the best in a plan of personal composition, but Argentina has brought us a golden medal and great joy, was a command of the Olympic qualifying tournament of the year 1995 in Neukene. </seg>
<seg id="29">With the role players like' Kanito' N'evesa of Pablo Alisea also of young Rolando Khurruitnera instead of the players, temporarily pushed aside disorder of the Pan-American championship, *Mar_del_Plata*, we have won gold despite all forecasts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Pikulin Ortis was without versatile doubts this. </seg>
<seg id="32">Its indexes on the international tournaments impress. </seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody dominated in Puerto Rico at this level so, as Pikulin made it. </seg>
<seg id="34">And without a registration it is its careers in the different leagues in which it played. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is a very complicated question. </seg>
<seg id="37">We had very good young, including *Julio* Toro, the Flora Melendesa Carlos Moralesa, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torresa. </seg>
<seg id="38">The work of Leo Arilly from young pleases me very much. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you believe your main achievement in a federation? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Participation is in the most glorious epoch of national team between the 1988 and 1995 years, and what at the beginning of the 90th years in BSN was before 17 commands in season. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What has had you to make? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The things which I wanted to realize were, for example *REGIONALIZATSIYa* of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="43">For example that the boys from Ponse played only in their region and only against the commands from other parts of the island there is playoff in national. </seg>
<seg id="44">Now the children journey and play too much, and it is excessive. </seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the fruits of obligatory certification and course for the managers, the officials and the judges. </seg>
<seg id="46">It delivers pleasure to me. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you now do? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen to music, I see musical videos of my epoch on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and I go from time to time on the basketball matches. </seg>
<seg id="49">And, I, of course, enjoy a society of my spouse Icabel' who always was with me. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">The Mayas have never predicted the end of light; it is just the key moment in a calendar, Restall has said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he has noted that the apocalyptic anxiety in the western culture which counts several centuries, where the people react to changes around it predicting the end of light exists. </seg>
