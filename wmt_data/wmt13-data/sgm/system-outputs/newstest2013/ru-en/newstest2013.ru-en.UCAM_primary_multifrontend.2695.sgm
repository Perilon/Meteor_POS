<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican strategy of resistance to the renewal of Obama's election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat the falsification of the election.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in the center believe the last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is for certain: These new trends will have a negative effect on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to the Canadian American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why most state governments since 2009 take laws, the process of registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, only one 2011 was adopted 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in the 41 state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyayut the right to voter registration on the day of the expression and take away the right to vote of citizens who have a prior conviction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, not one American state not oblige the voters to present photo identification.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana became the first state, which introduced a similar requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, passed in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past two years, they have initiated bills, forcing voters to present photo ID, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that in contrast to the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity card, a health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people, have reached the required voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by the governmental authority of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a document.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity often exceed a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who easily earn less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students - voters, who are believed to vote for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use photo identification issued by their educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">But these same states permit members may benefit fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans, voting to use certificates issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no state required evidence of the presence of American citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Starting in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures, apparently aimed to limit voting immigrants from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is estimated that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, the laws, uprazdnyayushchie registration of voters on the day of voting in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also have limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction has not been without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for voter registration has helped make the lists of about 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall of 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing early voting period.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who voted in advance, were, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same thing happened to come from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast to the white, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted in advance amounted to only 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several projects laws was vetirovano gubernatorami-demokratami.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most ambiguous laws was suspended when the intervention of the attorney general of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This allowed in part to limit the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring charge photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules, joined the action, of course, the implementation of suffrage in the 2012 elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics of the Democrats condemn the bias laws adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the 2012 election results in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">Report of the Brennan Center of 2011 demonstrates that states that implemented these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative effect on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Screening prostate cancer: pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In fact, the test PS is sometimes erroneous results, false negative and sometimes false positive that lead to useless Mu medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">Men, and so reluctant undergoing dispensary, and there is good reason for doubt even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Walk test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the research, conducted in the United States, observed numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the findings difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the European found differing levels of mortality for those patients who have been screened, and those who do not it took place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also showed, after a 12 - year observation that the likelihood of metastasis 30-40% higher for those who have not passed the screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men African-American origin also at increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is the right decision, as soon as the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cancer can be as aggressive and sluggish current.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient needs to clarify the extent of the risk of cancer, offering him options, without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not a danger to life in the long term, and given the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men who have indicated a cancer, will not undergo a course of treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not represent a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will them to offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly, we exactly define criteria for making a decision about who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine or not to pass this test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the test on the dog.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of scientific research, the observance of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all the people are nice and quite moving, 30% of cases could be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one smoked more, this figure increased to at least up to 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is a risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is doing immense harm to health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today, in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," said Press Secretary André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Promising fact: 10 years after giving up smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to Kar, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," adds the Association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The association also recommends that limit consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancer of the colon.</seg>
<seg id="41">To avoid the meat products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The past can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists engaged in research on the impact of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But for the moment, the results of these studies can not be called clear.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In an assessment of the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also no full clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">However, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family medical history is important to discuss with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgs boson in the details</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Summer a message that scientists may be able to detect the Higgs boson, caused a real boom - - and with good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that the boson explains the mass of particles in the universe, as much.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model, our best, or at least, "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter, "but which had not been able to find an experienced by.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physics are not fully confident that we are talking about bozone Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that it strongly reminiscent of the Higgs boson, predicted the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data presented this week at one major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it confirm the full confidence of some of the data still lacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Imagine all the same, that we are talking about bozone Higgs, because the chances of a mistake appear to be minimal, and see what it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There are, in this world one law is inevitable, said that two things can not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">To circumvent this rule there is no way, do not try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of the Pauli exclusion, which suggests that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" is a "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">On this basis, physics share particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermionami, who wisely subject to the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the other, the gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - - at least to this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the site (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory Berkeley, these are divided, in turn, into two groups: Meson, of which we are here to say we will not, "particles and forces," by which apply the basic forces of nature and that in some ways applies Higgs boson.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These most, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly bozonu: fotonu, or "light," which is a "courier" electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, when one particle, which has an electric charge, accelerates or changes direction, it "violates the" electromagnetic field in this particular place, it is like a stone thrown in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the "breach" is born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc., etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photo to date - and, therefore, one of the boson "vectors of force."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same is happening with the Higgs, with the only difference being that, in order to this boson appeared to be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs field much, much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to stir to achieve very, very high energies, as if it was a surface which could only be shaken by very big stone.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated in CERN's Large Hadron Collider, being a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - in order to achieve such enormous energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful and also to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson, and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all particles and not all of the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, he never will keep in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who interact, have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) do not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what "can do" all these studies, asks Ms Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">In the science they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (see), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts see.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, some of them passionately yearn for, to such divergence was discovered, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for "new physics" and plug some holes model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oj-oj!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But CERN such differences are not found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The benefits of this research for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.</seg>
<seg id="35">See: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not even imagine what kind of revolution will bring their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They foresee their application in science, but not more than that.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratory of Bell, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and who himself has developed the first continuous laser (previous were) in 1962, said that originally the laser was seen rather as a "laboratory gadget."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, the application can for tools, accompanying the study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same will and Ara Boyle during his optical research in 1969, has developed a small light sensor.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though it was not his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and has earned the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider and necessarily will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all can be.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, razrushavshij inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was given five years, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the orphanage palliative care Viktor-Gadbua in Belúil, where arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease does its work: unbelievable weakness, which does not give themselves to go to the toilet and even on their own to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees to him have helped to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He bodritsya, even manages to smile, to talk to strangers, who work around him, bring him drugs, lead it in the bathtub.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage before normal death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest desire to me cured the diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this malaise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"For the life we teach that a man has to urinate standing up," said Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the orphanage Viktora-Gadbua.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regress to the child - for some with an unbearable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It all depends on the ability of man to come to terms with the decline," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, in the opinion of many people involved in care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who received palliative shelter Viktor-Gadbua, all sick with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts looking into them to a maximum of three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more help, called "therapeutic."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ms. A., 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has enabled me to know their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children," she added.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I want nothing more in life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask, remove emitted breath.</seg>
<seg id="27">She is still waiting in the coming days last visit his son, from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the orphanage Victor Gad Bois with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is the palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can not be done.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make death more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one place in the institutions of palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, "explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors shelter.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether it comfort physical, emotional or spiritual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">We agree to provide wash of brandy or Pepsi, though he will ask.</seg>
<seg id="36">We no longer control blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening we had brought beer Mr relates, who died today at night.</seg>
<seg id="39">On the morning of his son to drink a beer in the feet of late.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help close, as well as patients," said Nathalie Savard, director of the care of the sick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the orphanage Viktor-Gadbua no day is similar to the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to the 93-letnim old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and pereprobovashij all, in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancerous patients under the age of 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients taken to an orphanage Viktor-Gadbua, coming from the house, and 47% of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care, that is available to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in the orphanage.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some agencies, such as shelter Viktor-Gadbua and society of palliative care at home of the big Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is this big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors - specialists in palliative care to fear the law, computerizing and assistance in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October circulates a manifesto, signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and doctor Lyapuantom and endorsing the their disagreement with a similar initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr Cristian Martel, Quebec health system not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before they will be allowed to transition to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already been minimal, when she stopped chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I reported my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said to me that regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the same time, she I said that my days are numbered!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Care no</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who asked about the death, thank medical personnel, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the team on palliative care facilitates their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsa, Yukon and Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care in the home of the big Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain inflexible in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient is sleeping to the moment of his death, from time to time or permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Can not be more pretend that we do not know about these suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not necessarily mean "I want to held," which means "I want to me easier."</seg>

<seg id="36">The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but, according to him, it will not change the situation: "While we do not strictly limit elected costs policy will be dirty money."</seg>
<seg id="37">It requires a complete overhaul of the system of granting government contracts and financing parties: "We can not go below; bravely in the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"Paris St Germain, FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season you have achieved extraordinary scope.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this growth?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by individual unawareness, but it can - - and new measurement of Paris St Germain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Profit great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">I next to them every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Technical staff also brought a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during the match, it's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything happens very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not LA.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the start in the center of the preliminary preparation in the Klerfontene and prior to my arrival in saint-étienne I always Chagall forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">So, you are learning the benefits of competition, established by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">Topping this summer is not a novelty play matches a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to a player like me, eager to be at the level and place to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">He help deputy like Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the owner?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti inspire respect the technical staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in the first league there is no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with top clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring new titles Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I was with him off the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I wandered away from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust, which he has me, also explains my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think of the first part of the season?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first League Lyon took place at the US leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still ready.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is the Champions League: we spectacularly qualify in one eighth of the final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, all can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say their word face to face with a very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish first in our group, in order to be able to take the return match in one eighth final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Whether a first class European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has a budget ...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win the titles and consolidate positions in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially Paris St Germain have the means to make this project real.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Do not take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a huge failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we warmly wish to get the champion's title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were close to it.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, it was a disappointment, because we had to come to the finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think it's going to be fine.</seg>
<seg id="53">Despite the fact that the fight for the title have entered such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expected too much from Paris St Germain?</seg>
<seg id="55">It's normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are fully ready to do.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we are at home against Troyes and we find that, of course, it's a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what in the first place people expect from us.</seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4 - 0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We do not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to implement a project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester United, which has two seasons fails to pass one eighth final, although they too have spent a lot of money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the invested amount, you were 15 points ahead of the winter break.</seg>
<seg id="66">It would be a dereliction of our opponents and to the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" the new Paris St Germain.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows just how fascinating first league.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paris St Germain, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of Ibrahimovi.</seg>
<seg id="71">So what if they say that there is a "Zlatanozavisimost."</seg>
<seg id="72">It only means that very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came to do this, and he proves that he is the first star of the league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">As a group we respect him as a person and as a player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people that surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he did, it's really only.</seg>
<seg id="78">It stimulates and others to improve their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">You survived the Euro - 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I warmly desire to participate in the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me a bit of game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw many things there, and I came out stronger from there.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I managed to play good qualifier matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I hoped for since my baptism of the blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first months Didier Deshama at the head of the blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They are effective for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">He has a good position in the selection group for the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="91">He is a strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would not want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has achieved its goal, he qualified us into the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead Blue to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Good honoured draw (1-1), 16 October in Spain is at the heart of the match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match has given us faith in themselves.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought for all.</seg>
<seg id="99">The shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on the central bank, numbered transactions between the receiving parties C commission fees on their processing.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as often happens with these technologies, clear political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, invented (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (convertible into dollars, Euros ...) and secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand sites take bitkojny for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The course bit coy on, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 Euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before return about to ten dollars (courses are given on the website of the bit coin charts. Com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing special compared with the global exchange real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.</seg>
<seg id="10">He describes the bitkojn as "the most successful virtual currency," "a rival the dollar or the Euro" and "similar to the common currency."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitkoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as "loans" used to promote the video game, which is made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchanged).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Social network Facebook also has developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the operation always exchange controls and processes of any central authority.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Bitkojn all nodes of the network are at the same time, holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers exchange, pokupatelymi and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Functions the network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users actually going on between the two electronic addresses, like e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information relating to the deal, signed by e-mail, using a system with double encryption key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network also can check the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to check that bit coy also used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounts book, sent Noah across the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A key step is the registration of new transactions in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It passes through the mathematical tasks, sent by computers, determined that, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase of hashing file, that is a large file conversion a digital signature, short and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers take "a new transaction and add it to the room, before" all together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number is found, other sites it is easy to check that it is the right thing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Transaction thus turns nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the digital signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the purpose of cheating user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice among and subject to money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed network - and the other would have remained unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="29">Computer, determined to task, gets 50 bitkojnov.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, the award regularly is divided in half, probably by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitkojnov in circulation therefore limited to 21 million, but they are up to one stomillionnoj, that leaves a reserve of ...</seg>
<seg id="32">The complexity of the tasks also increases with the increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Life Network already experienced the ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sites providing services, were subjected to attack, and bitkojny were stolen from the reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Used by the defect does not apply to the protocol," said Pierre well, who recently launched the pay company payments real money using the network bit coin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB said of the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But cash also have this disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="38">The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the blog software WordPress, their permit.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book and found that almost 80% of the bitkojnov are in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Giant sell-off" were announced in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," pleased Jon, working in Coinabul, which deals with conversion bitkojnov in gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Nuaza, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as operating network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or non-contact payment via mobile phone, but she uses to verify the transactions is cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The holder of the better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Enough to tell the address, which you can take pictures and recognize the "phone, specifies Pierre Nuaza, not to worry, because he has already thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general trend revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before bit coin to establish ourselves, will be some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to review a variety of risks, considered today elevated, in the success of this system.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Heavy birth of the constitution of Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This is a new risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play all out.</seg>
<seg id="4">Finding all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text of the following day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a week ago, the head of state has provided the Assembly two additional months to finish the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, in which several amendments that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative is only reinforced the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the president persists in its "autocratic delirium," continuing "to violate the word" and "flout the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be held within 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which makes the brothers to give up the intention to explain to Egyptians text, article after article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi, it seems, convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with American Weekly time.</seg>
<seg id="14">The more that the call for accelerated voting like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, "or you vote for my text, or I leave emergency powers," which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, for the most part, the Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most liberals not responded to the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to deliver an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="19">That the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare, participants were hastily added yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to our Muslim brother.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that in most cases, the articles were progolosovany unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators, by the way, the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day came around ... time to pray, because some members of the Committee thought that the hours of the constituent assembly were incorrectly configured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which yesterday even as the vote went, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of universal attention, Article 2 at the end of the day remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafi party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" to "rules" that would allow them more strict application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists the fact that this article has not been changed, is a testament to their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy," meet the liberals, who see in this a PR.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their view, the Islamization of the constitution is going through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point in particular to Article 220, which gives the university Al-Azhar advisory role, in particular, with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the laws of Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommiers, it is alarming, because "people to make decisions, not elected and do not have no democratic legitimacy."</seg>
<seg id="31">We see the emergence of theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals, of the fact that the next rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, "it is not, and people with university education, some trained in the French system" - calming Alexis, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledges that "around Article 220 ambiguity may arise, because the terms used in it borrowed from the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, "note ed.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may question how civil judge competent to pass judgment about it. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to their religious aspects, the text adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood claim that they significantly reduced compared to what were under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will take place not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests associations for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also expressed concerns about the text, which they consider subversive of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and from now on is forbidden to insult, that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, none of the articles no longer speaks to the protection of women, highlights the Kheba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word that does not appear in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">At a time when the Egyptian president was to speak last night on television, manifestation are scheduled today in the second half of the day.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million guest workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the most part, the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The law came into effect on December 1, according to which every labor migrant is obliged to take the test on knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">As long as this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the services, housing and utilities, life and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, over time, "promise in the federal migration service, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The surrender will have not only the language, but also Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will have to verify and to obtain, and to extend work permits.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exception is valid only for the citizens of those countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not subject to the law and people have to get certificates and diplomas on education to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The benefits, being doomed and protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language, Pushkin, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pass the tests migrants will in all cities; in Russia have opened more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to introduce testing supported and deputies of the State Duma, and the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="17">But human rights defenders, before the law took effect, many times had time to ask a press question: what is, in fact, will?</seg>
<seg id="18">That will change the language, and for the Russians, and for the visitors themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, say representatives of migration services, "this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor of slavery. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Many say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the representation of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">Protection of their rights should start before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only organized system will set at 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems appear the migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding the language, "said Sebelev the future migrant doomed to face a dishonest people who under the guise of aid vsunut him" putyovku "close Barack, where he and dozens of his kind will be months languish without food and documents, 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We get many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"At home they promise one thing and on arrival they deceive, select passport, not pay promised salaries," confirms the chief management labor migration MC Tajikistan Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not rugajsya, nasyalnika!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country, which seek, but also on sobstvennykh-to write with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it is not so much their fault as the trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive even primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because their families can not even feed the children, let alone to their dress decently, and with the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Dorastaya to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if not with knowledge of the language, they admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and shallow."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, in respect of the language of the law, human rights activists note one important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there are no status - there will be no examination, no subsequent official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the visitors claim to get official status in our country is not as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason is bureaucratic and all the same language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Staff of the Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, there is no registration, hence the cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Not, buy painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it turned out that there are not only false documents for registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">Few "sham" certificates of completion of a language tests already seized by the federal migration service.</seg>
<seg id="48">Fake paper printed on ordinary color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is more than two times more expensive procedures official testing: It will cost Labour the three thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption, to "ID" could not be simply buy, converge and representatives of the authorities, and human rights activists.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the meantime, the authorities can promise am, not who managed to successfully pass testing the first time, the study of basic language course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, visitors who do not have knowledge of Russian, will be offered work in areas which do not involve active communication with people.</seg>

<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market was there "through the fault of the officials, whose work is related to the weapons," the report said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17% of cases, the weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur theft at the stage of the production of weapons, 5 percent of the "black archaeology."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="52">Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">Former military Victor Huperzia tried himself in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid - 1990s, when it was preparing to publish an article about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">The scheme, he said, have not changed.</seg>

<seg id="5">Shares support trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to raising modest salaries, who receive ordinary employees of Walmart and fast food system, the aim of the co-sponsors of the protests is the establishment of trade union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this sector of the economy hardly stirred with the trade union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Shares began last week, after a day of Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America fallen orgy of cheap sales, with millions of average citizens, and sometimes accompanied by.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which all over the world work 2.2 million people, have left their jobs and picket secretive together with the trade unions and left-wing activists shops Corporation, whose goods provided for people of modest and middle-class.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all in the world, from the cradle, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Many underpaid workers Walmart only in their work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap in part because little is paying their workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The past also complained about the heavy working conditions, for example, the lack of trucks or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded higher salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">The typical worker Walmart, 9.5 dollars per hour, this expenditure not afford, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley, argue that if Walmart will increase salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart entirely wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will do them all 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year they will spend some 12 39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart fairly point out that the protests have occurred only in the nine states and not caused corporations or malejshchego damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total of the cash registers produced in "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Corporation spokesman Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post, that Jobs left a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just "another gimmick" a trade union.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">"Free cash!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (in this city does not favour, and so they are not), "MacDonald si" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="31">At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7, $25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food restaurants over time increase, but not much, and on average their ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less than them in this expensive city no one earns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How can you be in New York for the money, incomprehensible to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through "MacDonald si" took place almost a quarter of American teenagers and their after school, living with parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw it as a main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now I am constantly coming across' Web interview with workers "MacDonald," who complain that must live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the Forum newspaper, the Wall Street Journal hanging commentary, whose author notes that irresponsible to have a child, if you do not know what you are going to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday, "MacDonald's" on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum earnings.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that the fast food in the area of trade union organizations have been created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration rarely makes it easier for them to life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But cover Union fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Not consonant</seg>

<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests were held on that day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highlight of the action was in the middle of the day rally of McDonald's near Times Square, which made by several local Democrats, in particular, member of the Dzhumejn Williams, insisted: "McDonald's says that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even give you the hospital and does not pay you for honest work!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the City, Bill de Blasio, insisted that "we need to vigorously join in support of the fast food workers so that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every nyu-jorkets!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described what happened to the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it involved only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which New York tens of thousands of people.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Fool the brain is medium"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among fans of modern technology theme, rich augmented reality recently taken seen largely through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">First summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it was known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A conversation with the head of the group of Interactive in Kembridzhskoj laboratory Microsoft Sharamom Izadi follows that for scientists of the company points - passed stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Tell me, please, in general, what does your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time, are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">As humanity mass at the stage of the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at five to 10 years ahead and foresee the drastic changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the prefix Xbox and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, after all interesting zhestovoe management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">What are we waiting ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- despite the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction to a physical level, much still going on the flat screen, sometimes in 3 D.</seg>
<seg id="13">Enter information improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, working on true three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including proektivnykh.</seg>
<seg id="15">Need to release the computer world in our physical, make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complement real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell these stupid virtual reality helmets!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about the voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">The popular thing, but do not overestimate it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It certainly is not a panacea - privacy question, because they do not always want to notify others of their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own market niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project, in which we thought over gestures, but not over, and over such being parsimonious, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, the gestures filmed not camera device, and naruchnym, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">While big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of wrist watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Like?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- for example, how do you ask me to give you the bank?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"I usually just say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- that is, you want to force users to adapt to what can or can not at the moment the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think in the near future we mostly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will more precisely define the human reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"If you're talking about your work with sensors Xbox kin, what you claim to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Lacks permission, depth or something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"In principle, the current generation is what can make a start in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a rate of 1,000 a / s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not in themselves, as the Matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">The last point of view of the current technology is not good enough for us - it adds to the work of designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is, to keep in mind not only about resolution on axes X and Y, and Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">Traffic rights quite dynamic, and the current 30 to / with frankly not enough, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Beriev be quieter with our P laboratory made the sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - - from 1 to 100 m with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60 - 100) index.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction of humans and machines.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would in my work is the equivalent of such a device, not requiring kasanij to frames per second was more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- and the number of cameras increase does not need?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- There are three "chambers," one of which in fact - infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And this is the third camera is, in fact, the typical sensor of the visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially more cameras could solve the problem ...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount of settlements.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be a good idea to create a flexible counterpart kin, play with the camber location of the cameras and to see how this will help in 3 D determining provisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"As far as I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not presented to the public their points.</seg>
<seg id="56">You do not think that in terms of everyday use of technology, rich augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"Of course, all the time, holding a smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but that's what I think: The most steep option would be" "reality, when on the basis of cloud platforms you could switch to points on the smartphone, projection screen and then everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Points is a very personal device, at the same time, their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time, the weakness of the reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in" Iron Man ," but also an ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem, which often indicate critics of this idea: there is no tactile recall!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands do not feel anything!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing for the challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">In his lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh account breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth may well be an additive of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - Use of second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It perfectly registers clicking!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are technologies that are aimed at giving this "the images in the Air" - for example, several aimed ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense, but as long as it is very weak - as if you on the pads.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets at the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers is a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">"You tried to deceive the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Make him think that he feels that seemingly must feel at the moment when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"That's a good idea, we have not tried to do so.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lies another task over which will have to beat for a long time - - how to make a person physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is an open, virtually endless - work and the concepts of cross-country tracks (not, like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">The fool the brain is a medium, the work is still very for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is what makes working on virtual reality such attractive to researcher - many things in absolutely its infancy.</seg>

<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian dressing in order.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now on clothes are met, based on foreign mechanics, not the inner man.</seg>
<seg id="46">And, perhaps, his hand file can not be and should be.</seg>
<seg id="47">And deception will be lifted with the help of dressing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> "We recently saw you in the role of the city. - cultural city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, like me, they will be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> "Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Now commercial art has to be orderly, considerate, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">Is disintegration of cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier, the people pressed in the pack, La Bohème one loved, another.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now all crashed mikrosoobshchestva, is hard to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not one hundred dollar paper to all like.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - come to broshenki there sekso-sotsialnaya sphere works.</seg>
<seg id="60">The cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10,000 not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, do not spoil acquired.</seg>
<seg id="62">I wrote in his youth such paintings that one collector they are on the wall next to the Falk and Larionov by Hung.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with the paintings, which usually finish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often confusing.</seg>
<seg id="65">Say: the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture of consumption, it is of another opera.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of culture yesterday, grew the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I for this is culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill, which lacks Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> "Good cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such a notion: official from the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all of them can do culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">The right tsars was, the Kings, can not really understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is in Moscow now good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">In St. Petersburg people have to be experts, but they are, need higher experts who correctly appreciate these experts and will give them an opening.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now thrives vkusovshchinka.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we take, there are some artists who should look for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - what is for you - St. Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> Petersburg is the cultural capital of culture in Moscow, much more, there is soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">And our stones art grow hard.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">Here in Europe a lot of people are curious. Who go to exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">We have this layer.</seg>

<seg id="5">In order to save humanity, the question arises as to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is small.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, these planets only two, which you can explore at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's Venus and Mars," said a senior researcher at the National Astronomical Institute named after P. Sternberg (sh) Vladimir sur Dean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if Mars conditions more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus - temperature to 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus ... in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">A half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations grown in orbit peas are no different from their terrestrial varieties.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then in orbit insects, tiny fruit mukh-drozofil.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, space sent eggs quail, to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We get on exit absolutely normal young bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">But further problem begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem related to the fact that this nestling must find support, he must get back on its feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Not finding support, the Chicks indiscriminately.</seg>
<seg id="20">And after 10 hours in newborn took place full atrophy instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks do not react to light and sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And there the trouble was that after four days they just died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And the two times we vyluplyali chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the space Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Animals last time biological "minikovcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">The biosputnike "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The experiment with rats, which were sent into space with the fruit.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there found nothing supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It was just the bio satellites, but again, this is an isolated experiment, and such research should be conducted," said Vladimir Si.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After the landing of the space rats appeared offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the approach to the problem of reproduction directly in space until it happens.</seg>
<seg id="32">Not an easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals, losing, usual environment, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">The man, in contrast to the beast NIS, in principle, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create an emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ethical reasons such experiments are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women in space travel for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the most precious, that humanity, is a woman's body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Chaika flown, and no one on Earth could not say whether he will continue after the flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">If she can give birth to a child after the flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, no one responded to this question," said veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child Andriyan Nikolayev was a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second Svetlana Savitskoj, twice in orbit and in outer space, was born the son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have very little units there are astronauts, who after long flights all cost, and growing healthy generation.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if more, it is dangerous even under orbital flight," summarizes a cosmonaut and hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia's Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And yet, humanity should look for some new ways of biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="51">Here in the zero astronauts skills in outer space.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If the adult water, albeit comfortable, but the alien environment for infants - native element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ikhtiandry seemed to confirm - life on the land came out of the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months mother in "one liquid, it is easier to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, is only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is a very little to something to forget," says instructor swimming Marina Aksenov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In short, if a child born weightlessness more natural state, for women necessary gravity, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Very quickly in weightlessness dryakhleyut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls ability to expel the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">Oh well, skip it, relying on stimulants generic activities.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, it.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And then what?" Asks not trivial questions Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Not feeling of Earth's gravity, the body does not form a skeleton and muscle system.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special suit for training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will be deprived of what it will be vital.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment, we will go with you, kept the birth of a child in the environment, will lead to what we on Earth completely dezadaptirovannogo man," foresees the head of the committee on bioethics IMBP RAS Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The chief of the management: checking shvarts-sistemy failed through the fault of the politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the field of public procurement Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, has lagged in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This statement Miroslav Kala, vice president of the supreme security management of the interview for the website AK Tu N. Cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough," commented on the current situation Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Such conclusions provides joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practices lead approach Peter Nechasa to the so-called shvarts-sisteme.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs audits - is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be in any way set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister can not stand up to the work of the institutions, which compelled to check and seek the implementation of obligations," notes Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within the framework of which was the legislation on public procurement in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">A parallel testing, which we started, probably, two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, the question is whether that European law says, how should be public procurement, followed by national legislation and then application in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All the information was collected and, even if unfinished verification, revealed some interesting differences - in short, the legislation we can be "accurate and infallible," in practice, however, the use of certain parameters we concede Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows that it is not enough to create more and more and more revised rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As well as the project can help you, what it means for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">A joint control can contribute to efforts to stop clarify laws, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy means getting appropriate things for reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact that we will reach, reducing the limit orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This system "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restriction had not declined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about internal problems in the practical application of the law on public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as a functioning control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">If there is such an organization as our KRU (Kontrolno-revizionnoe management) or this works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the institutions, as our KRU is re Ch, arranged in our principle, there is also the college, which operates a bit differently, but for the most part, both institutions operate similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of federal lands - - in their system is different from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can only manage federal money, we have a state means.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal calculation chambers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the local law, there is easier than we have?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany and can be used as a model, but we can not definitely say that it is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is the case, because they are better at dealing with the control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely not, I repeat, such comparisons do not like.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it must be said that even countries are faced with many problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Speaking of domestic law, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow manifest consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not manifested itself in our work to control.</seg>
<seg id="35">So as we carry out control in fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Take this into account in the process of preparing future inspections - we started using our new tool to detect risk neekonomnosti ," through which we almost 14,000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There is, of course, these changes will come, because changing restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you think the approval of this law will benefit or additional strain on the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and, I hope it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that may arise, is that the rules "uzhestochatsya" and it will be impossible to comply.</seg>
<seg id="40">The functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises intertwined with the supplier (for example, regional operational programme - with the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whether in such a case, to tighten the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think that in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit the formal mistake, not influencing the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And then how to get out of this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's recognize that this path will not lead anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the prime minister said that will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called shvarts-sistemy. What does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">"Shvarts-sistema" is prohibited or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be in any way set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister can not stand up to the work of the bodies, which compelled to check and seek the implementation of the commitments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say: "We have this law and let it," but you can not say that we will pretend as if nothing is happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public procurement contains very strict rules, and it should formally be conducted, and it is the right thing. It will protect public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it's tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of formal defects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough.</seg>

<seg id="13">Apart from the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want, together with the public consider the condition of the world, we will one day pass on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the calendar we have created a unique collection of objects of the shoes, T-shirts, bags and original against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website of the www.e-tap.cz and thereby accord US support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group of the tap tap together with other musicians also sang the hymn against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="16">Sounds whether already fancied listeners YouTube anthem on these concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, in the end, if in the end, it and the end of the world will not come.</seg>
<seg id="18">His singing all the artists for all concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hymns at the same time also live Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomasz Ghana to participate in the performance also Xin DL X....</seg>
<seg id="21">As you have begun to cooperate with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also cooperate with other Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charitable events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Try to connect them to these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It turned out that many would like to work with us, it is interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the purchase of equipment for bezbarernogo educational center STUDEO, now in its sixth year we are working with civil association of tap at the Institute of Edlichki.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers regularly attend school students Institute Edlichki and spend with them cheerful and interesting events.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the money to go to the teachers, and thus we try to give them the opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the additional construction institute Edlichki in the future there will be a separate building, in which we are with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At every concert will feature several musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What were the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to draw up a program that would interest all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Bart, the tap tap, Marjan and Jií Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of all of the details can be found on the site at KP KS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If you are planning any such grandiose events "in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, will for the first time to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we'd love to have representation in the Czech national House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you cope with expensive in terms of organization and logistics??</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five participants in the electric wheelchairs, their carriage should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes of instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, as with that without problems. Czech Airlines SA and British airlines British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, that I was surprised how many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The abroad you can compare the different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes towards the disabled and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">You encountered to date?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where all works better than we have, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at the basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still in the independent movement of the electric wheelchair in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also not in the course of such banal things as a give way to an invalid in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up advanced country?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things, the level of performance which far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of the people whom it concerns.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is normal that people with a severe form of disability to move in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere ...</seg>
<seg id="55">There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in that we have with them the tap tap a little!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect the public or bezbarernost is one thing, but at the moment when among us will well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then really start to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">This isolated cases - - people with a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group of the tap tap is very popular, but back in two years ago, in 1998 you made to organize?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the institute Edlichki as teacher and around me there were a lot of young people who wanted something to do.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am a musician and play the saxophone, together with a colleague has organized an interesting music circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, over time, says our leading lad I Angelovi, a bit spun out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity came only in recent years, or I something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true, we helped that we have begun to join the famous singers and actively working on the propaganda of the group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess, as a matter of fact as if does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Due to the funds of the European Union we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Whether standing in front of you a goal so well turn the tap tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In show business is full of things, one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, all new is taken with caution, and lasts so long.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is very little rare things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, sorry, of course ...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity completely izlishnya, because people with disabilities are not some afflicted with and all abandoned by individuals, whom we should pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people who can live a full life and evolve, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if people with disabilities something happens, this shift is not only for them, but also for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Provided the success that you strict head, what you believe many?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do the job properly, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think that it's normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and two times a week to learn that they have to go to rehearsal, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly losing enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But this is the same in any group that wants to work and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently group the tap tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many were at the beginning of 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one way I Angelovi.</seg>
<seg id="83">We open Group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those who have the desire and will power, our doors are always open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">He will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20. 12, 2012 at 21:00.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The concert will take place at the stadium in the Prague Incheba, in Brno - at the club F Da and Ostrava - in the center of the p ly no JEM with the participation of the 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the European Space Agency on September 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the next years took an active part in a number of projects the agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the way to space Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before World War II Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always seen with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let me remind you, for example, lectures A. Stern, who on December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas of his pioneering work "introduction to the Cosmonautics."</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (1905.) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only doctor Jan Kostka Gadomski was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in France won the prize Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis for "Introduction to the Cosmonautics."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr Jan Kostka Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became the great propagandist, astronomy and space science.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Became known world propagandist space, and his contribution was assessed including the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway, equipped with missile engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear even to break up or for braking carts had to be used rocket.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about the drezine known only from the press of that era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about the missile.</seg>
<seg id="17">Study Section technology weapons in cooperation with professors Mechislavom Volfke and Gustav Mokzhitskim.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of the remaining materials can be seen that research has reached the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the arrival of German troops work was interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, in the specialized press had the idea of rakety-istrebitelya, which proposed engineer Rogozinskij, and the following year out work "air raketa-torpeda and aviation raketa-bomba" author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotskogo.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war all the projects military use of missile technology was involved in a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (TYMCZASOWY Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the start of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work devoted to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (to two YC).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of the magazine's 1954 "problems," in which four volumetric published articles on astronavtike.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a society that will be kosmonavtikoj.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish Society of Astronautics (POá) attempted to join the International Federation of Astronautics (based in 1951), and in the autumn became a full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And next year, the first chairman of the POá Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956 to and contributed to the development of a highly successful meteorological rockets RM (R Aki ETA o logic), which became the first Polish missile, fulfilling Shay scientific study.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of RM - 1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rocket, capable to overcome distance 1800 m, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently was built improved version of the RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on Bledovskom conducted tests of the two-stage missile RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was the length of about 1.4 m, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the missile was already in a position to do the real scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the high-rise wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962, further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The first missiles RM became rocket meteor - 1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as two speed, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Developed three types, designated as a meteor - 1, - 1, - 1 C), which were split by the size of the camera for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rocket meteor - 1 and had space volume of 0.4 L METEOR - 1 - 0.34 L, and meteor - 1 - 0.6 2 L.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum flight range of all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968 for years in the Aviation Institute was the development of missile Meteor - 2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket Meteor-2 with initial weight of 380 kg was able to bring useful cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then were built version meteor - 2 N and Meteor - 3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Should also mention the accession of Poland in the (Committee on Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of the National Committee two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, within the framework of Inter space, Poland participated in the research of outer space on a Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosaw Hermaszewski became the second Inter cosmonaut after Vladimir.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">Resolution caused heated discussions in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issues from a broader point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberalno-orientirovannye economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, is not restricted movement of private capital, together with raw financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of the significant difference in labor costs (wage) there is a price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept to understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods is trying to stand in the economic competition that "the cost of a competitor in order to take a larger share of the market and, thus, to increase their own income.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale this means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries where the cost of the labor force, compared with other, high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including for produced them to unemployment, the growing the inevitable state spending on social needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the situation strengthens the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the public economic and social damage inflicted by them in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that do not need to bring specific statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bestseremonnye methods of private capital create at the level of the economies of individual States situation, when governments are forced to enter into competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the government give own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">First and foremost, it is reflected in the changes of the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to economically to force his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of the increased levels of poverty, and at the same time, and the difference between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the Federal Republic of Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves own labor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people already approaching one million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occur cases, when employed by people get such a salary, that the state they should, that they have a living wage.</seg>
<seg id="23">A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU, of course, lead to the same state, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it did in the 19th century, or exist on the extremely low pay on the margins of society in the hope that one day the country will come to the private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But may I ask you, where he will take?</seg>
<seg id="26">If capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, an Egyptian, African still works for the European share of wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and the media to nausea, argue that the state can not participate in the capital of their own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not management actions to interfere in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the question to be answered if private capital does not work, now almost managing policy and the entire state, in their own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">One digit answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Proof of the existence of virtually all able and the omnipresent Lobby in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result we have a hopeless situation, corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that the Public Ministry due to lack of financial resources like the development of bills private legal firms, which are tightly linked to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills approved by the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power comes not from the people, as the saying the constitution of the western type, and from the finansovo-moshchnykh groups who prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that liberalno-orientirovannaya democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a situation, as described Appianom in the "crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has been disintegrating, and departments are involved in the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal acquisition with stones and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Taken och range and corruption flourished without any taboos, and ice used to go to the elections in advance sold voice "" ... decent people in the position of the ruler, in the end once the state in the eight months left without consul ....."" Began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose vigorous man ..." Appian thought that it would be a Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy to autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is already at its core is not intended for use in public order.</seg>
<seg id="42">The present result is no different from the past: the demon approximate decline of elite without any efforts to reform the deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">Means the cause of the rise of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of democracy of the liberal type can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">First of all, tragically, that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least, not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">So this trend is systemic in nature.</seg>
<seg id="49">The decision is a targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="22">The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (of so many slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be other than as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.</seg>

<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century the Rothschild family provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>

<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was instigated by the military on the 2 nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a hearth war, the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers will manage to unleash, the Jewish people, as well as in World War II, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, simply put, the Muslim population of the Middle East.</seg>

<seg id="36">Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers people to vote in the election solely their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's Hawk is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician that makes everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), threatened to turn into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (ship corridor is only 2 miles wide), also lead to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film "operation" Argo ": When worse, Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The US administration a positive outcome of the situation not to be counter-productive - she could not afford to throw out the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prisoners diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations mediated by the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate has caused home a wave of solidarity and anti - Iranian sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election year, ended the election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film, srezhessirovannyj actor Ben "operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of the six embassy workers managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">After some serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, helped extravagant I legend cover, according to which they rode the Canadian passports as members of the crew, ski existed in the country a place for the filming of scientific and fantastic epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendes, required cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">Legend to be reliable, in specialized magazines wrote about the film project, people arranged press conference, fictional manufacturing company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film is a particular combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film-kinoopus," the story of a successful project, is an example can be a number of films about friends.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film constantly changing mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from Tehran (a subtitle shown significant historical photos of events and the way in the same situation have been demonstrated in the film is a big difference not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, with irony and moderate an exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then the scene of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the staircases of institutions, on the phone ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Affleku remarkably managed to make a career.</seg>
<seg id="24">The vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The operation" Argo "his third feature film, the dark detective" Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller" The Town " (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, this is the first film, which is not removed in the hometown of the director of Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sense of the atmosphere of the place at the same time is one of the qualities that earlier film director above the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck is shown in "Argo," where Tehran "plays" Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film are in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the entrance of the scene of the fall of the embassy impressive for its clarity, which also captures the emotions of confusion and that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues reach in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters in the bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a host of exciting scenes cinematic value.</seg>
<seg id="33">He has been successful in working with this little, sometimes something - there it all comes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents a looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Chase runway looks seem pretty).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The lack of "Argo" is a distraction, associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are not alone in the film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The film lacks a bit, this is a film that you can watch with moderate interest in assessing the performance and, thrillers of the Seventies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But captures with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, it is enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated idea of and vseznayushchikh security services.</seg>

<seg id="7">The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The controversial EU directives applies, for example, as well as a mandatory addition of the fuel, that as a result of damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury gradusnikov only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or directive about the size of the cages for chickens, as a result of the this year significantly tightened eggs.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose position in Brussels usually protected by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic now even under the threat of the veto to stand up for the requirements of their banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby are: for example, higher quality bananas in the European Union were to reach 14 cm in length and would not have dared to show ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the European Commission justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing disparate national rules that are complicated by trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The EU, despite the opposition of some states, all same softened standards relating to fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing Directive will lead to rastocheniyu products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate to win in the poll could be and last year's ruling by the EU, according to which sold balloons must be bathed by warning that children under the age of eight can not finagle them without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU has asked the American research, according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">Portal Bank ov pop LAT Ky.

<seg id="21">The EU has set the maximum amount of supplies that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, set amounts of canned mushrooms, for which it threatened a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the questionnaire also interested in the idea of pay some countries, because they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the statement about getting subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas have emerged in Prague, rather than in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage, because we do not have sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ask the European Union about compensation, "said in the fall of 2004, then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palace (CSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As the argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases the state had full warehouses reserves that it was necessary to take out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of Euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">As a result, the European Commission went towards the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for the subsidies offered to villages, the ministry of regional development, minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go to the preparation of applications for subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="31">EU: bizarre orders are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the Regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulation, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A serious problem, experts say, is the attention of EU grants to projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have made in discussing the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Arouses emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians have retained the name Olomoucké Syreky ," but" Tuzemskij rum ," whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename the" Tuzemak. "</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">I do not think about to become a senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If we all in the country function without problems, then I would not ran.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can not see the country in the last 20 years, as is busy finding the thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I did not have ambitions to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that I do not like, then try to find a solution, as change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I was forty years old and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I do not have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You have got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Do you turn this way back to the people that you have chosen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I always used to say that the key to the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I said that if I had chosen senator, I will run for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not a post office is a tool with which I can make their views.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is why I have the greatest influence and vast powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation Rop in a bar or watching television, but at the same time, ready to anyone who will try to change things.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this are added to the media, which rights ochernyayut, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, said about me, that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Go to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">The struggle for the presidential castle you started with theses of material and criminal liability of politicians and the inverse of property declarations on the amount above 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To accomplish this, it is necessary to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You as president such authority, and only a Senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct tours became free entrepreneurship, it managed to advance.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or right, he deliberately were being thwarted, which discourages citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent without party person I have much greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I am without party raskladyvaniya order, without regard to the tenets can take each party that is best for our country, and to apply it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">Do you think of yourself as a man, more relevant to the right or the left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that my people attribute more to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it does not matter at all - a little bit to the left or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important that we go forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is not that someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that in politics you did not hold on.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material responsibility?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on their side, so that we have achieved his.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected president, would not have amounted to problems to organize direct TV broadcasting, in which I shall refer to the presidents of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they, in the case of refusal, will have to report it so it does not want to.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong personality, which abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the president - - it was a credit pressure from the public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Say directly that I'm a lover, not a genius and not intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I am only a beginner in politics, and for his program will try to get the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">Things I am trying to promote themselves; if it fails, within six years and return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This is partly sounds as if Moore's eye must save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm no savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one I did not do anything, so I bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to the Radimu Yanchure, he refused in connection with a large volume of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also I at least supported leading investigative journalist Jan Lorenzo, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I put forward my candidacy, because people really did, but now I feel myself the balance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to chose representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Independent in the Senate only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about the basis of his own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought, because I do not have time to check the purity of the past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money to do so.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You do not have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You're talking about property declarations, and how the situation is your own business with this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Personal wealth is estimated at about 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have a station in Prague will cost approximately $25 million, 10 million apartment, another apartment at 8 million, a collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston Martin 3.5 million and Koda per million, and a few million on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way Aston-Martin I appeared, because it was my malchishechya dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was with women and at the same time, fought against the meanness and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive the Aston-Martine, own property in the 60 million and you do not have the money to the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say you want to change the republic, but their own money particularly in this invest do not want to.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I have to inject themselves into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign I invested 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I do not have sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign I essentially cover senator's salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to make money, so nowhere not ran.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So you will continue to engage in entrepreneurship, in order to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Do not you said that reduce these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it does not depend on the size of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, its activities I partially reduced.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, managing director of the tourist agency in the spring will become my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like, that I was Bess N Nick, that will keep the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also have to do something for a living.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive each month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that get further.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if I become president, his business would be finished.</seg>

<seg id="6">Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned library, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, maloprimechatelnomu spalnomu under, belongs to an unusual record.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its population numbers 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To deal with that unfortunate fact a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build the seven fictional bridges depicted on Euro banknotes, in the form of a spectacularly colored miniatures of reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the city fathers realized that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau, master of bold diagrams and the author of the witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and the grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And the members of the jury looked and shrugged shoulders, bold Maas of his original gift piramidku in size and completed it in defense of his project in the following words: "Dear citizens!"</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's my proposal: "book mountain" in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, this mountain $30 million Euros increased.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, Mail and several adjacent apartment buildings and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November "book Mountain" was awarded second prize in the contest "the best library of the Netherlands 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project also participates in the national Dutch contest wooden buildings of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, faceless suburb, which previously could not offer nothing but the postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly beautiful city hall, the white facades that suggest the milk factory, wealthier the one modern piece of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the most important in the Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: Eldorado under the hood for cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is only one elevator, passing in the center of the mountain array, for real fans of architecture and reading choose to explore the area on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">Osteklennoe from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, the floors of bricks and elegant street lights accurately create a sense of public town square.</seg>
<seg id="25">Urban environment perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="26">View unwittingly looking for the bench, dogs and playing football boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere, books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Usually bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is the big dark hall, as a rule a comfortless and faceless," says wines and Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have set a classic configuration space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner space of the book Mountains used skillfully: in the center are located offices, internet-biblioteka, chess club, environmental center and technical facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Especially delight black bookcases that serve as the finish walls, railings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their appearance, texture and smell of unusual.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even experienced architects and lost in conjectures that kind of unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We were eager to work with the secondary materials," explains Joop Trauborst, head of the project, representing the community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as lining under the roots applied artificial material mm thickness.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thin textiles serves one or two of the season, after that, you can throw.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the Library This painting - for the first time in such volumes - was panel four centimetres thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called Lund plastic (K LP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, solid material, smell a bit like a new car and a little sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On top of the lead 105 steps.</seg>
<seg id="42">Those who overcome path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch kroketami and fikusami in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care about the atmosphere, and in the first place the right humidity on the literary mount.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The cost of a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"It's hard to believe, but the building, in spite of the many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology," said Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">For his heating and cooling used heat of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book Mountain stands in a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="48">Vast farms of wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take up a large part of the solar rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room very nice.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the protection provide fully automatic roller blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, mentioned above skeptic of the of it, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Verkhajg also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">As well as traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which called Bukenberg "soul Spijkenisse, which long lacked."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book of own Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books were to fill the empty space on the shelves are not yet fully equipped library - at the time it was 70. 000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">Shelves to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than polupustaya library," says architect Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that our invitation now every citizen in some ways connected with this new home.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it serves only to decorate.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, M VR DV managed to solve the royal task, which in the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And even if they are very young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is only the starting point for building identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "the Germans should play a more important role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on the narrow the diplomatic path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Germany now need to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that the American position she also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - not speaking too critical towards Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a forbidden zone for flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, NATO conducted this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely transferred from the policy, which, so to speak, led the United States, to the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no agreed common policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that as long as they are only a part, but are on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such a foreign policy, which holds France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What specifically means "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">This willingness to borrow in their national interest position, unaffected by the position of the United States or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests largely different from the interests of the other large states, and Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Whether these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not attached to this is too much importance, it is not completely unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On whether Germany and its relations with the United States, refraining making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I do not think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Germany may even acquire so a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all, it signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that its interests must be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, on the other hand, clearly voiced support for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The American domestic politics such differences existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has a sufficient understanding of the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But the local political situation, the government, of course, can not hold such a position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that significant differences of opinion is not as significant as always seems to be.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not thrilled with Netanyahu's policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they can not act as part of a broader approach and have to instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">That's the way they do with the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that for Germany, it is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">The issue has always been a sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany sees itself as an important international player - not whether it will take a really major role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or leading role is still hard given Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not accustomed to this, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still is always hard to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Consider, for example, the Euro crisis - every time when Germany takes an important role, manifested various feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">The Germans do not just deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, this is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a much more precarious position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, the influence of the United States in European policy is weakening, but at the moment the EU is not fills the vacuum, then who is?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans just have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like, unpleasant or increases to you - this is the life!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of trademarks in China:" When PUMA and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is officially registered the name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, it will be protected as long as the owners of the original names not will put an action.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Foreigners all the more difficult it becomes to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattlokh, lawyer Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights in the trademarks in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my desk every week a new case of this kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Imitatoram enough to add a couple of letters in order to get the right to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">From Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattlokh opens the folder with records departments registration of trademarks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trade mark Z DF Puma, artificial name, which used the name of the fashion house er Gil do Z.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese are world champions copied and violation of intellectual property rights, it is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In big cities are high-rise department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the case Pattlokha not such. On behalf of their clients' he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from departments registration of the trademark right to use the name, which is already protected by somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "ban minpaj" marka-passazhir.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word is associated with "ban dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">Call women who are hunting for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities did not recognize the guilt</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"This damages the business, it is necessary to fight," convinced Pattlokh.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Trademark, unique position lost, image suffered tremendously."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries millions, especially in the case of expensive products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company's market research, China with sales of 15 billion Euros per year is the third largest and most rapidly growing market for luxury goods.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, to achieve the removal of dubious records in the Register of Trademarks is difficult, and is it expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattlokh tells about cases in which the court dismissed several claims, as at the end of a long time oprotestovannoe name has become "reality of the market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff does not lucky, he will have to pay, as damaged his trade mark in China, says Pat the Loch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there is ruled by the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a famous case of graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, the company Daimler lost legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, Enterprise, which shortly before acquired firmu-proizvoditelya.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">Buying Volvo company Geely initially used the blue and white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Producer fashionable goods La cost E lost in China of Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">Agency registration of trademarks of CT Mo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to lack of personnel and equipment premises there have been difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the last year was "return from an emergency situation in the working process to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the amount of untreated cases of objections has decreased by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was closed almost 5 7,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However 8 1,500 claims are still waiting for the production in the agency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To combat this expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the past year in CT Mo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This record and means that China is the tenth time in a row, headed the list of new registrations in the world, according to the agency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">If simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 Euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Appeal against its worth many times more, as it shows the German family enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the group is fighting against the Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans managed to make the illegal production of counterfeit auto parts was liquidated.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, fixed the Chinese rights to the trade mark.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was his own omission, as surnames in Germany are not subject to the protection, says Hanno Venttsler, chairman of the board of the chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the agency registration of the trademarks of CT Mo rejected the claim Munich residents.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, in both the following instances won, but stops the other side continues to struggle so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Need to be on guard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Venttsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal costs are unlikely to yield accounting, the archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago to bring evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, to no avail suggested adverse side of the "big six amount in Euro" for the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"It is clear how expensive it is to us," said Venttsler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The danger of the Far East threatened to spill over even to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the register there a unprotected trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name for shoes and leather goods.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group has long ceased production in these areas, but it was able to prevent the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It is necessary to be vigilant," said Venttsler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and lawyer Pattlokh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "all that is in any way to protect, to register in China," said Venttsler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it may be worth far more than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if you lose in the last act of his drama about trade sign, you will have to pay to the adverse party licensing fees for its own name, explains Venttsler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise we drive away from the market in the unsettled segment.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," said Annete Lennartts, "because he has to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Quite unusually for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its love of excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, at a state style of life also lays the blame for the fact that the virus has spread so quickly in the past years.</seg>

<seg id="3">The ice sheets may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Space agency NASA of the United States proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although it is located closest to the sun, there is also a water-ice: according to three studies, published on Thursday in a special journal Science.</seg>
<seg id="6">Probe "messenger" found evidence that constantly located in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.</seg>
<seg id="7">The thickness must be a minimum of 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Presumably, the water is a comet or asteroid, confronted with.</seg>
<seg id="9">No one connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific head of the probe Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other construction elements of life got in other places in the solar system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as "Phoenix," explore the depths of the universe.</seg>

<seg id="48">In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe mostly there was hydrogen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Probably, the telescope was invented in the year Lippersgeem - even before the Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror optical telescopes became more and more - and their view available space deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, telescope at Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the United States, set the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"Gran Teleskopio" has a giant inner device - diameter of mirror is 10.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Mirror the big South African telescope "in South Africa, for the sake of reducing the cost.</seg>
<seg id="59">However in diameter it reaches approximately eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">Lack of inexpensive constructive implementation: Telescope tightly to seal at a vertical angle - it limits his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Telescope "in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">His feature: high svetosobirayushchaya ability.</seg>
<seg id="63">It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to terrestrial signals in space.</seg>
<seg id="65">Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">By participating in the project, "the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), anybody with a computer can help by providing its computational power.</seg>

<seg id="69">His four mirrors allow cover in visual pipe even middle infrared range.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The Chilean Observatory ESO also planned to install the European "very large telescope."</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror should raskinutsya by as much as 42 meters - and will be made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the photos should be expected not before 2018.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007, both "the Keck Telescope on Kea were considered the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They installed two mirror with a diameter of 10 meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">"The Keck telescopes" are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them also looking into the sky with the help of telescopes "Subaru" and IR TTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">In addition, the Mauna Kea should be a new giant telescope with a mirror diameter of three meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here you can admire the illustrations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important types of space delivers "Hubble space telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">April 24, 1990, he delivers picture of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler "searches for planets outside the solar system - first of all, such possible life.</seg>
<seg id="81">February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 12 35 candidate planets have been detected since the beginning of the mission.</seg>
<seg id="82">The photos sealed last cooking space telescope Kepler ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">James Webb Space Telescope (JWst) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard rocket Ariane 5. "</seg>
<seg id="84">The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: He must in the light of the first stars and galaxies look for big bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists suggest that at the South Pole Mercury is ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is no reliable data on this, "Messenger" revolves closer to the north pole of the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">By radar measurements over the decades, pointed out that the ice.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto sets presidential sash and will take the reins of the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Before him is no easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico has made good economic performance in the administration of Felipe Calderon, which now stacks its powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years already claimed some 60,000 lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government says the people of Mexico about its willingness to deal with violence," said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To such statements next to the president of the United States political career of Mr Peña Nieto has evolved in the post of governor of his native state of Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his homeland, in the vast state surrounding the capital of the country, the new opinions are divided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Straight linear person</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is fondly remembered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Residents put him in the merit revival of tourism, the development of the resort areas and the creation of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">The city can be reached on one of the new highway, built, Mr Peña Nieto, who dramatically different from the roads and pits, which were previously at this place.</seg>
<seg id="17">A placard with his name hang on a modern building sports center and on an impressive interactive museum devoted to climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We associate with him hope for a real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, congressman from the state led by Peña Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed in our country, in the first place in the field of security and economic development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party were relegated in 2000, Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12 - year-old absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos party has high expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>

<seg id="24">This is a great statesman, and, above all, a man, able to listen to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But in another part of the state, many people had a different view of the former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The municipality of Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad not, is a most striking contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under flyovers of highways, it is in many ways the city of Mexico City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the municipality are too severe character of this metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier this year for the pacification of gangs, drug trading in these areas, were involved troops; and violence against women is here particularly acute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The near the vast landfill only in the last two years found dozens of bodies of dead women.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City at the time of Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar indicator in the infamous proslavivshemsya violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become, when it comes to the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto, about him at best, it can be said that during his tenure as governor, he failed to cope with the problem of the murder of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the worst case, his administration has been accused of full ignoring the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">A resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this area, Buendiya barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter Mariana moon.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of the Mariana committed suicide in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">But her family believes that she killed her.</seg>

<seg id="40">In this, they said, was denied this family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"State officials appealed to me as with the old spletnitsej, narushitelnitsej calm.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want people to simply accept on faith what they say, and pomalkivali.</seg>
<seg id="43">But this is wrong, so you can not, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings, "she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The presidential sash on Saturday, the president of the Peña Nieto with it will take the tough responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico raised crimes of violence, and the new president promised to make a solution to this problem a priority during his rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that he will be exactly the same as President was the governor," said Olvera, congressman of Valle de Bravo from the PRI.</seg>

<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination the story of an American of Mexican origin.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country's difficult times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans American origin are caught between two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico City I went down the hall for coming close to the border control zone and remained on the ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs pointed to the two lines: one for the S (Mexicans), the second for extra Ros (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I have a few seconds stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and my life called Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's just a code name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish people and friends from New York, and see themselves as Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, I stopped complex design "an American of Mexican origin."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary poorer than that of native speakers, and I can not get rid of American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Because I took my American passport and was in line for extra Ros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">The order of the day stood usual for meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The president of the Peña Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, in which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the president of the Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relations with the United States is hard and full of old grievances question.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans never thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun rifles forced its leaders to give up half their territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of the events in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is only any U.S. statesman obmolvitsya though word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite Mexican society there are heard complaints that the Americans prejudice the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyayutsya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the most complex are Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to talk about resentments?</seg>
<seg id="29">Enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find in this country, and those for whom such opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone's father or grandfather "did not have the opportunity to realize their potential in Mexico and was forced to go to the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most were Mexicans of a certain type -,, from poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we remember about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico, see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and made ourselves on the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination and it is not clear, but we know what kind of country considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and ruling class does not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">We answer them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of degrading defeats and refer to us as a people of the second grade, as to the Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not well speak in Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our very existence to them due to failures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.</seg>
<seg id="44">We would not have turned out to be just behind the curtain, finding in the US life, but having lost the spiritual connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me of that, between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin, it is a shame.</seg>
<seg id="46">She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to none of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springs Tina.</seg>
<seg id="49">Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we call Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I discovered during a trip, as if our relationship is not intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Americans of Mexican origin worked a kind of Mexican ambassadors and represented its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell our friends the Americans what this beautiful country and how nice to visit, and be able to convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yeah, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">It will not work out.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many grievances in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not believe that the country is so very beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sorry, but with this themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And this is true.</seg>
<seg id="61">If part of the Mexicans still can not forgive the United States as they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they would have to take and the fact that some Americans are of Mexican origin are still in grievances again for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battle the New Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas group can be a fragile foundation for further peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If it is possible to have a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound, have become the usual, useless debate about who first began; many buildings turned to rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, issued from the territory of the Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in the eternal conflict in the Middle East came changes.</seg>
<seg id="7">To this can be interpreted in many ways, but the events of the "Arab spring" zakruzhili in the rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis failed to stay away from the vortex, the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than before.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this mortal impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">War without winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, this situation gives no cause for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if a ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be occurred this week clashes have only strengthened the position of the security forces on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, to complain that they forced Israel to retreat, despite the incurred losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas increases its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, acted with the support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two, the victorious Hamas supporters say the around Israel Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, which is ruled by paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which more and more about Islamist insurgents is about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where King threatened power allies of Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous Arab country and important in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, are the organization, in many ways similar to that of Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic rasstanovkakh Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time, supporters of the "tough" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of running Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to their unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Another important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed from missiles, issued from the territory of the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part due to the wall, which comes to the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River - a large part of the recognized a Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the set at 22 January elections - teamed up with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What is the meaning to pander to the Palestinians and give them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you give in their hands all the power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will start to launch missiles from there towards Israel, as do their brothers in the Gaza Strip?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the proponents of "hard" line will win; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings towards Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Defense budget of Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.</seg>
<seg id="38">The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on a cease-fire is a good sign and could well mark the beginning of the change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the onset of democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that sooner or later Israel in the occupied territories, like bus, blown up in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">The violent operations, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the movement Hamas, have to pay the growing frustration of the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need the outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It remains the only solution, to which relentlessly call sober-minded representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of the two states and territories concessions to Israel in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hope, not too impressive in the short term, "the hope that a ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence on the parties to the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which long time to make a decision to cut off weapons into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote at the United Nations, which may result in the recognition of virtual statehood of Palestine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Its role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he has not presented its own plan for a peace settlement.</seg>
<seg id="52">After returning to the White House he still demonstrates a reluctance to connect to the solution of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">It disastrously position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Australia the law came into force on the unified packaging for cigarettes.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the hazards of smoking and images of the stricken by diseases of the body parts stand out on the damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The world's first practice Australian law on the packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color design different brands of the same box unylo-olivkovogo color with nasty snapshot of affected parts of the body, and images of children, whose health undermined their parents' smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the buckets, introduced compulsory this Saturday - name brands, which printed the same small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most severe conditions in the world for registration of the packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of fashionable status.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basis for such decision laid studies that people who do not smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of registration of the packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to the research, that, for example, crown logo is associated in children with the idea of the princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the world's lowest share of smokers, so these changes are not specifically have a bearing on the profits of transnational corporations, however, the possibility of such measures already view and other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which would be sold cheap and available cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Producers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone, on the other hand, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha of the small family company Zico import Pty Ltd says that the demand for and silicone, hides unpleasant pictures on the packaging, rapidly grew (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to appeal against the law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Ha, Company Z ICO already implemented about six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's a good business for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among the part of the population, the aim of these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the adoption of the Australia A number of laws that have made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers display cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the Web, but it can not limit the foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you trade tobacco and you only left this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet will seem to you very tempting," explains Beck and Freeman, and the next issues of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews on brand names, written on behalf of the supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">The question is whether it is a matter of the hands of the average citizen, who so loves cigarettes Marlboro, not spare effort and time and made a video, or behind this advertising campaign?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says that the industry is now more engaged in the adaptation to the new rules than advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new rules: These states show claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying that trade has undergone unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries are poor.</seg>
<seg id="26">The WTO decision is expected by mid - 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Thani P Lieber sec, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of the adoption of similar laws on the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, Canada first introduced compulsory placement of photographs, warning about the hazards of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia demonstratively not obey innovations.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures I not graze.</seg>
<seg id="33">I just do not pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Just vykhvatyvaesh cigarette and pryachesh pack in his pocket," explains Viktor El Hague who buys cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor mouth on the pack.</seg>
<seg id="35">To be honest, the only thing that can make me give up - this is my little daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James, head of the store tobacco products king of the pack in the center of Sydney, argues that the same packaging has been complicated by the task of goods on the shelves</seg>
<seg id="37">"I used the unloading of the New Party left an hour, and now four hours," he complains.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then said: What is to be done, okay, it's over, close the shop," he says, vskidyvaya hands up.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our aircraft revealed mechanical problems and be replaced by other aircraft, of which we were pending.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, I had plenty of time for reflection about the nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But recently, more and more scientists and specialists in child development support the idea of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored is not so bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because in the modern world we are constantly in front of any screen, the benefits of boredom they pass us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Maybe we need to strive for boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="13">We'll be back to that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I, like many, felt that boredom is the invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is not the case, says Peter Tu, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the fascinating history of boredom " (live ly: a History, Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in discovered Latin inscriptions of boredom, dating back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At the same time, remains an open question of how we understand the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often transform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Having studied materials research on this topic and by asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but can not do that would bring them satisfaction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between boredom and, he says, is that the man does not do something that would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">The apathy to do anything I do not want to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Main the experience of boredom, he says, is a "violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in mood and a sense that time is as slow."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The description of boredom can seem very similar to depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible link between the conditions, skuchayushchie people see the causes of the problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people outlive depression, see problems in the.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we just hard to focus on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal perspective on psycho logical science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues cite conducted earlier experiment, participants who listened to the recording of the voice, reading a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants also heard the loud sounds not related to the case of TV programs included in the next room, others have heard these sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly be dealt with, and a third group listened to the recording voice without any sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard a TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, most of them found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this, and attributed it to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we are trying to focus attention on a difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause weariness, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Gvelfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we do something neinteresnoe, "for example, the flow of products on the conveyor belt in search of marriage, music can help avoid boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is believed, he continues, that when people start pokachivatsya on a chair or draw a picture on a sheet of paper, they do so from boredom, but now we know that in fact doing just help not relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The study found that children who do not prohibit and go round, learn better and remember more information than children who require sit quiet," says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In some moments we all experience boredom: in the event of a delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an interesting film.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, different people demonstrate varying degrees of propensity to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980s to measure such individual features researchers have developed a special "scale the propensity to boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, "much of what I have to do, and chant" or "me too much fun, so anything that do not have time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers have determined that the boys more than girls, "says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with a variety of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, in general, teenagers often at all.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted by pager almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7 to 8 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said they bored in school and during the implementation of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">At the same time, only 3 percent of parents said that they are bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he knows that "adolescence peak propensity to boredom," mainly because children and teenagers are not allowed to fully decide, than they do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Go back to my original question: boredom is useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes no, because in extreme forms it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor water, dedicated to the study of the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"So our brain tells us that it is necessary to do something different; this is the boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.</seg>
<seg id="49">However, this is the brain does not always know what it is better to do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you will be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you get to watch TV, you will be better only for a while, and soon it will pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom themselves, or otherwise make in any other way to manage their time and employment, "says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"Such skills independent regulation uses in a variety of situations," he says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only on their own to occupy himself something, he also learns to control at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that need.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, considered it a bad not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rather, we must learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agree with this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We see it is that we need more experience boredom, boredom is extremely unpleasant, the desire to do something meaningful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">In fact, people want to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In the modern world we are used to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when the silence, we do not know what to do."</seg>

<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, a 19 - year-old player football team and a student of public college in the southeast of the state of Colorado, charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be completely legitimate throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Lamar and drove in a car near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by police.</seg>
<seg id="4">After police found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco came agenda to the court for possession of drugs and possession of device for drug use, minor offences, for each of them owe it to a fine of $100 and appointed date of the trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are treated as criminals," says Mr Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But he a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law as the place of consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, already removed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations already stopped nominate charges people under the age of 21 years or older for possessing small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law will take effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana, and still attract responsibility for the storage of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, in some cities to the suburbs of Denver to the mountain areas of the West vote to prevent the emergence of new in their places, licensed staff shops for the sale of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All of this is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Representatives of the regulatory authorities in Washington state also puzzled about the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They will form the rules for determining the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In Colorado more than an orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian. Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages in Washington state.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent, which we could consider," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Bill of the state of Washington, called I - 502, takes effect on December 6, and for a whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system do not, and the right of ownership of the marijuana already authorized.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are still difficult technical aspects to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between state regulation of "adequate access" to the licensed marijuana with a ban on trade it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergarten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It's very hard place licensed enterprise trade in marijuana in the boundaries of the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the newly created research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21, Police chief Oates of the Aurora sent out to subordinates e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office will no longer attract persons under the age of 21 years, to account for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stops ulichat people in these violations "from this moment."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance in the city of rules governing the activities of persons, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute illegal traders and distributors of drugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Prosecutor Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to the issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the use of persons to undergo a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of less than two ounces of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our institution has a duty to pursue the actions that are deemed to be criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr tank in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was controversial even in places like rural Mesa County, where the voters rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracted to the responsibility of adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="30">District Attorney Pete Khauttsinger supported the decision, but also decided not to take accusations on already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I believe that enforce the law as long as it does not change is our direct responsibility," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55% of the population of the state of Colorado, participated in the vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reaction of residents in different parts of the state of ambiguity in the relations between the local authorities to experiment of the State of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The district prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean MacAlister, Denver's lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have been persecuted people for it, that now can not really come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington - - the first states in which a small number of marijuana are the same as for alcohol is destined to become an experimental field in the scale of the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized by trade, but at the same time, they are cautiously waiting for guidance from federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice to give in on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several have received wide resonance arrests of traffickers and patients, marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases, made good on trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Agents of the bureau for the fight against drugs are unlikely to be in the house, to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to be to turn a blind eye to regulated by the authorities of the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser of the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the action of the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, and so would not be able to open up earlier than a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration by the six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to be in this position, that we give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and those that voted staff.</seg>
<seg id="47">Still a lot of unresolved issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Uajett: I survived from Oxford, because I am a conservative.</seg>
<seg id="2">Pre following university students for their views did not begin today.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best institution in the world, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, zakladyvayushchij two foundations of civilization - and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet, after two weeks of study at the historical faculty of Worcester's College at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I gathered up their bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father could not stand it and cried.</seg>
<seg id="7">Friends were get confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I threw college, because I did not like the fact that my and have sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer E. Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In fact, it was not so funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran, because I systematically persecuted and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied at a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I herbs or only for one reason, and in this renowned cradle so light it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wye, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You ask, why should remember about it now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the latest data, a new generation of students, center-right views, subject to the same etching.</seg>
<seg id="17">This and growing hatred of the studentam-konservatoram in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as one that is provided to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The conservatives of student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say that their "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to introduce to the Committee on Equal Rights college additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation is only exacerbated released recently on the BBC 2 documentary about politics in a student environment "country of miracles: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives presented eccentric and.</seg>
<seg id="21">The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, who travels in, wears a silver suit and a walking stick with a silver nabaldashnikom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities studenty-konservatory complain that they make "scapegoats because of raising the cost of their studies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke black, 20 years, vice president of the Conservative Association at the University of Nottingham, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in the university environment increases distortion in the direction of the left.</seg>
<seg id="24">People who we do not even know in advance consider us arrogant and with impunity children of rich parents. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history faculty of the College of Corpus Christi, which were filed a petition on strengthening protection, calls the atmosphere "neuyutnoj," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club to formats center-right views significantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for a normal life of the members of the club," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I came there in September 1986, timid and shy 18 - year-old girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford from hatred of the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="30">The year before university voting deprived the former Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of the reduction in budget allocations for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time that await me ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">I did not know that teachers not only watched through fingers on studentov-konservatorov, but also gladly took part in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and opposition of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - have slipped through the wooden panels of the wall audiences.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first seminar I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Uajett," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "Please, translate the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">The text was given to me hard, I.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face like a cake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Tetcheristy fundamentally not teach French or they simply did not have enough brains?" He asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes made by tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I advise you to take a few initial lessons of the French in their free time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," probryuzzhal Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to my room very unhappy.</seg>
<seg id="44">That evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, a student of the second course with the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Association of the University.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said in a friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> "Unfortunately, it is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">Over every, who is suspected of being supporters of conservatives, will be.</seg>
<seg id="49">I myself is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the pervokursnikov-konservatorov pretend that they labour ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in the local pub, I timidly tried.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that agree with all that Margaret Thatcher says.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trick failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">Freshman of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of fascist pigs.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contagious. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students picked up his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was worn, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"As conservatives have sex?" Asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> "They like each other, right?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like, must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="61">If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or I will have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">If I am forced to hide their true beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="64">Upcoming me three years began to seem like a hell, full of hardship and loneliness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only teacher in my college, not his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to the Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriter.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college, he has not appeared.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised him for provinciality, and commitment to the Marxist-Leninist de term view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you will not be happy," he said to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I travelled in Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and Metropolitan friends.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.</seg>
<seg id="73">He did not believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies in the 1940s there taken any political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But in fact, it's the best university in the world," he said.</seg>
<seg id="76"> "There is not able to, not only in the city of slumbering Spires ...</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my druzya-kommunisty always behaved perfectly. "</seg>
<seg id="78">His wet eyes pomutneli.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Do not pick up any hasty decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that it's just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">You struggle my heart, if the university. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was exhausted and regular trips to London and my emotional protection ultimately collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a conservative, did not survive the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">Next week at the seminar, when another teacher of history quite seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the heart of shame, I admitted that "I clean brains parents," and called them "old fools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail in the coffin cover my career at Oxford was destined to score my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time he wrote every week two columns for Publications, owned by Rupert MERDOKU.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I did not leave, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I have not returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me plaksoj and cloth.</seg>
<seg id="94">But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only released Fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day, hiding the reputation of the university, in which the value equality and Freethought.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local proverbs like "Let's put it Bao (roll) in the stove," to laugh at the level of fertility in Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="10">This is the main problem in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world to reproduce their kind, so we felt that this is the theme that we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government attempted to do a lot, for example to carry out the launch of spirits with pheromones or arrange quick dating (blits-svidanij).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why do not we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 child</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who do not take it so lightly, so it is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is spending $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm for the birth of more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs of maternity leave and provides tax breaks.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all of this has low efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high-tech gosudarstvo-gorod in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore, according to the national management by population, is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why Singaporeans do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tang Wei Min, director of the Division of Policy for couples and families of the national office of population, says that the reason for this "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This allowed people to have a wider range of options in vital goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of a family," she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms contribute to a rise in the number of singles and postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to a sharp increase in immigration to counter a reduction in the population, causing outrage among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are Web sites, where rampant xenophobia many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which is criticized for keeping wages low and the unwillingness to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Growth of immigration is seen as one of the reasons that last year, Singapore's ruling party has received the worst election result since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in fertility has a known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, an example of Singapore also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is making efforts to not so much small housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Guide to urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box," which you can build in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments 46 square meters sold very well.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is an opinion that they can contribute way of life and deprived of incentive to developers who want to build a large family homes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the firm El developers, says that their "shoes" boxes sold much faster than the more spacious copies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result, our cash flow increased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he acknowledges that the new rules give more clear benchmarks for developers, who had placed obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too perenapryazhennye</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules can be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking with Singapore members who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems, that they will not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very overstretched, housing expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people this delay," said a young manager.</seg>

<seg id="43">Digital Aborigines they, children and young people, who were born in the era of technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Explains that this topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria of what you can or can not distribute, publish or speak, at the age of maturity, when there are not enough to do this."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also to be selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences," she added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the expert, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, "to ask questions that make them think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Tell them that they did not do this, it is useless," she added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Porras lists some options: There are things that you would not have told the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, you would have liked, if published the photo you like the one that issued you about your friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know that others publish about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you photos from the parties, if you ask permission from other people, to mark them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And another, all I need to know, what are you doing in each moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to make them understand that they must behave online as well as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">The rules are the same.</seg>
<seg id="56">"The Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, should be in social networks," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Vigilance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for the heads of families in good faith, read the policy of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">Understanding each of the points, they have a good basis for discussions with children about perceptions of opening an account on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, age and allowed to distribute or publish," he says.</seg>

<seg id="8">"Not understandable, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum given Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa assured that does not regret the decision, because with him it is not their principles, and comply with its "profound values of democracy and human rights."</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that at the time, "were certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be respected process."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual offences, while the Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it through video conferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said Ecuadorian head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That really there is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health because of the confined in a small space without the possibility to do exercises on the air.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It affects the health of any person," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum, granted Assange since June in Ecuador's embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of immunity, which will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that negotiations were in London on the search for a solution to the problem of prison of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We are not negotiating about human rights, it is a word we do not use in this case, but there were constant debate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because a lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garson, leads a number of processes in different European instances," he mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And expressed the view that "if the United Kingdom tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as it perfectly allows its legislation and how it has done in other cases, Senor Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or the Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took advantage of the opportunity to show itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and stressed that he would not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The main enemies of freedom of the press is not damaged zlodei-politiki, and bad journalists, support, blackmail and extortion," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this aspect, he remained satisfied that neither of these journalists, "neither bankers nor Bourgeois Hegemony countries do not dominate in Ecuador," and added that, being reelected, "deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to retain veto Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and will not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of legality," because in fact "it has eroded the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Ecuadorian president considers, in addition, "perfectly legitimate" desire to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos negotiate now with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of the maritime sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the moment the decision is not enforced.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.</seg>
<seg id="29">Need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He also expressed hope for a good end to the dispute on maritime borders, which are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed that "the right thing for Latin America to turn to international instances, if the two countries are committed to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Regarding the ability to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considering this possibility "with optimism and joy, though sometimes it's pretty hard."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa assured that if loses elections in February 2013, it will leave public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Personally I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be fixed only by the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement stated that I guaranteed the probable victory, so you have to accept this responsibility," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In the event of a victory that would be my last term in office of the president, and then we got out of public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you lose, the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This decision," he confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which has already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will skip the campaign to return to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="40">"This does not mean escalation of the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 when he declared that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I was like," he recalls the difficult, despite all the tact of a doctor, moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man concealed it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">By deciding to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to know about it as much as possible and his efforts to materialize - he said his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabrizio is one of the oldest patients VICh-otdeleniya Hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he got in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He lives with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe, too little then there were treatment options, too little is known about the disease, too biased treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he was."</seg>
<seg id="9">In other words, in those days to have AIDS was sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to do so, not worsening the quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, not knowing about the disease, many people still come, when the virus has already damaged, "depleted" their immune system and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first alleged cases, "a great achievement for the moment is that the survival of the patient, who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the VICh-otdeleniya hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">And an expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, the better the expected life expectancy of those who do not drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD 4, and up to 50 years, when reported about 500 CD 4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that the one who receives a diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To assess this progress, should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today the average is 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS, declined 6.6 78 in 2007 to 4.8 62 in 2011 annual report (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients died in the national database.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May of this year; however, argues that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Why still have a lethal outcomes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "Personally, I think that the problem is not access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I should imagine case in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least the last 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about his infitsirovannom condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He led the crushing data: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when we already have some opportunisticheskuyu infection; that it is necessary to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to conduct a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people that it will be asked."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In his proposal to agree upon experts and officials of the State Council AIDS prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who asked to check in a private laboratory, only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi cancerous tumor, which is one of the more common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that will die, and do not want to know anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Time will still die, the better I'll be over and three times a week," they say. But not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I eat almost well, do exercises, take drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, to bother about itself and about another person," enumerated Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with mil en IO JAL I SCO, to encourage their statement of those who now, in the context of World AIDS day, experiencing fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let, and if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is his message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Big gap between the programs in the field of health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the city of Guadalajara, which involved problem associated with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, dedicated to this task, "in fact, increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we offer packages of 100, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to a condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why do you?" Is a popular question, with ekhidstvom and condemnation, from the social workers, school advisers, employees pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear the teenagers, assured the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="39">I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only and to a hundred them was in the slot machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">Does not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">There is no talk of payment of beer and the motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether possible distribution of condoms under his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="42">"This is not sexuality, the best way to make condoms available for those who practice sexual activity," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key data in Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Registered 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state ranks fourth in the national rankings new and total cases of AIDS and HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of infections are related to sexual way, 6 percent through blood and 2% of the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as the one registered case is from 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The poison basketball traveler Hector "Hetin Reyes" was more than 60 years associated with this sport and, through it, have been all over the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few people in Puerto Rico keeps in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "Hetin Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And after all, before the bleeding in the brain to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, in the small categories as a player, the player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and the head of the Cowboys Bayamona and the president of the Federation of Basketball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I have done a lot of roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BS N, director general of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during the visit Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes not exaggerates, making this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated with many photographs and unforgettable things gathered for its a long way to go, show about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón, Puerto Rico in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With big emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cove fighting since the mid - 1950s as a player until 1982, when the age of 15 years his performance in the role of the agent or agent of the contract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"These were my best years, whom I enjoyed most of all, because they had the opportunity to be part of eight championships Cove fighting since 1967, as an agent, the agent or head.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year debut in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since then, and continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Gene Bartow, Germany, which was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, rising 6' 7."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Do you want?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And it was the beginning of means and, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then recommended that Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that said that if the means and brought the championship well, Gauss would help to win another.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Chempionstvom Cowboys with Gaussom I, but at a distance, because the 1988, already the head of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was to be bronze, if it were not for the Canadian judge, who made us beat the final game, Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best team, what you ever saw?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the 2004 Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the one with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and defeated the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that we won bronze at the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the team not only played again, Gauss, Ramona, Fico Lopez and' Pikulina' (), but also young (Javier) ' Tonito' colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario" Morales, who was unable to participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but it has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players like' Kanito' Nevesa, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Khurruitnera in return players, temporarily estranged the mess in the Panamerikanskom championship Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without any doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His performance at international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level, as did Pikulin.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this is without taking into account his career in different leagues, in which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto Rica head?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a very complex question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good young growth, which includes Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raymond, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the young, I really like the work Leo Arilly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What would you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s was to 17 teams in the season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">You need to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, to the boys of Ponce played only in the field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now guys travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I can see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.</seg>
<seg id="46">It gives me pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoying their grandchildren and occasionally go to the basketball matches.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, and C Abel, which has always been with me.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week students explore the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In this semester, when religion professor Stewart charm, decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had irresistible lure: the end of the long countdown "Mayan calendar, on December 21, for which many people seized as proof that come the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But the charm had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: a catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddonom," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian end times theorists believe that will start the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did not realize that it will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said charm of this week, students at the University of Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we are left with only 30 days, it was a really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the topic of "The End of the World" in this semester, in theory, the latest in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At Temple University associate professor Barry in Acker reads course on "Media, Culture and the end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze why these ideas are spread over time," he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, polar war could break out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, the students analyzed films in the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with the examples of real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell students that is likely, plausible and it is impossible," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his counterpart Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, gathered to read a course called simply "The End of the World."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We do not add' 2012', to always be able to read the course once again, in the case if the end of the world does not come," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "destruction," students should learn to prepare projects and to take final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that leaves students no choice but to work "to the same night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Courses were quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Place ended in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with high average, 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have received messages via e-mail for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked, is there still a place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="25">Will Vekesa, 25 - year-old student of the department of psychology and nursing, said that looked all the apocalyptic films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I never heard about the course, which taught this," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I like him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the students surveyed - - not to mention the professor - - not to said that believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project touched on Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited," said Julie Zeglen, a 21 - year-old student last course in Templskom University of Uest-Chestera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he noted that there is concern in Western culture, which goes back centuries, where people respond to changes around them, predicted the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In other places people do not think about it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mainly in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question about whether he knew of a course of "the end of the world" there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines not to participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the superior court.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall drew attention to the fact that for a long time been said about the many days of the last of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "People immediately begin to think about the next date" or that on December 21, is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers blithely refer to that date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some said that they were going to go to parties "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Maybe call someone from friends, to laugh together," commented on Samira Ford, 20 - year-old student at the faculty of communication.</seg>
