<h1>
<seg id="1">Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's repeated election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Leaders of republicans justified the policy need of fight against falsifications on elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">However in Brennan's Center consider the last as the myth, claiming that cases of falsifications on elections in the United States are more rare, than death cases from a lightning stroke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Besides lawyers of republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One can be told with confidence: these new tendencies will have negative impact on a voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense similar actions partially discredit system of the American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada American states bear responsibility for the organization of federal elections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this reason the majority of the governments of states since 2009 adopt the laws complicating process of registration or vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon received new scope after elections in November, 2010 which brought to republicans of 675 new places in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result only in one 2011 it was accepted 180 bills limiting a vote in 41 staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New laws on elections demand from the voter to show the identity card with the photo and the proof of existence of the American nationality.</seg>
<seg id="12">Besides, these laws reduce the period of early vote, abolish the right of registration of the voter in day of will and take away a vote from the citizens having a criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">To elections of 2006 any American state didn't oblige voters to show the identity card with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana became the first staff which entered the similar requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the USA confirmed constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice and to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Within two last years they initiated the bills obliging voters to show identity cards with the photo, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that unlike Quebec the American citizens have no such universal identity card, as a card of medical insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Really, 11% of the American citizens, that is 21 million people who have reached age necessary for vote, have no identity card with the photo, their staff given out by governmental body.</seg>
<seg id="20">Besides, five million new voters in 2012 have no similar document.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus the cost of obtaining the demanded identity card often exceeds hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New restrictions disproportionally mention youth, minority and people with low level of the income.</seg>
<seg id="23">Really, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people earning less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of citizens are more senior than 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years have no demanded identity card with the photo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But there is more to come.</seg>
<seg id="25">To students - voters who as it is considered, vote for candidates from democrats, in several states it isn't authorized to use the identity card with the photo, given out by their educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote generally for republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs for vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Till 2004 any staff didn't demand the proof of existence of the American nationality for vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time the similar requirement was entered in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011 more than ten states adopted the laws demanding from voters to prove that they are citizens of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures, obviously, are aimed at limiting vote of natives of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is considered that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of Democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Besides, republican legislators initiated the laws abolishing registration of voters in day of vote in eight states in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wishes to be registered.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction didn't take place without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during elections of 2004 campaign for registration of voters helped to enter about 10 million citizens in lists.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time the measures taken since 2009, led to falling for 17% of level of registration of new voters in 2010 in comparison with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition republican legislators adopted the laws aimed at reduction of the period of early vote in five other states.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, during general election of 2008 in Florida of 33% of the voters voting ahead of schedule, were the Afro-Americans though the last made only 13% from total number of voters of staff.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same happened and to natives of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Representing only 11% of voters, they made 24% of citizens which voted ahead of schedule.</seg>
<seg id="41">Unlike white which, forming 76% of voters, among voting ahead of schedule made only 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Certainly, democrat legislators and their supporters actively oppose adoption of the laws limiting registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Some drafts of laws were vetoed by democrat governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">Action of the most ambiguous laws was suspended at intervention of the General Prosecutor of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">It allowed to limit negative consequences partially.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the laws demanding presentation of the identity card with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules which have taken effect, certainly, will complicate electoral right implementation on elections of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Critics from democrats condemn bias of laws which were adopted, seeing in them an obvious orientation on affecting results of elections of 2012 in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report of the center of Brennan of 2011 shows that the states which have adopted these laws, present to 171 of 270 voices necessary to electoral colleges to win presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Still too early to claim with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of an electoral system will have essential influence on results of presidential election of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one is undoubted: these new provisions will have negative impact on a voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense similar actions partially discredit system of the American democracy.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Screening of a cancer of a prostate gland: to be tested or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Actually, the test for the DOG yields sometimes wrong results, pseudo-negative, and sometimes and pseudo-positive which lead to useless medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">To men, and so reluctantly passing medical examination, is from what to begin to doubt even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">To be tested or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked opinion of two experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the researches which have been carried out in the United States, numerous cases of infection among groups investigated therefore it is difficult to interpret the obtained data and difficult to develop any accurate recommendations were observed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other research, this time European, found a different death rate in those patients who passed screening, and those who didn't pass it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This research also showed, after 12 years' supervision that the probability of emergence a metastasis is 30-40% higher at those who didn't pass screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I would recommend to be tested since 50 years, or with 40 if one of direct relatives had a cancer of a prostate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men of the Afro-American origin are also subject to the increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key moment is adoption of the correct decision as soon as the cancer is found.</seg>
<seg id="12">The cancer can be both aggressive, and slow.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient needs to explain degree of risk of its cancer disease, offering it possible options, without an obligatory cancer therapy of a prostate which doesn't pose hazard to life in long-term prospect, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active supervision over a disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men at whom the cancer is revealed, won't receive medical treatment as their cancer isn't aggressive and doesn't pose threat for life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will offer them active supervision and if the disease starts progressing, we will begin treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even more often we with an accuracy define criteria for making decision on the one who has to or shouldn't receive medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I would recommend to be tested after all.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to consult also with the doctor to define, it is necessary or not to pass this test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International association of urology, Movember created the tool, allowing to estimate everything pros and cons of passing of dough for the DOG.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (while in English, transfer will be available soon) it is possible to download to the address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent an illness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no wonderful recipe to prevent a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite progress of scientific researches, observance of a healthy lifestyle remains in the best way to reduce risk of a disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is considered that if all people fine ate and moved enough, 30% of cases of a cancer could be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If anybody any more didn't smoke, this figure would increase at least to 50%", - emphasizes with Andrée Beaulieu, the press secretary of the Canadian association of a cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, by estimates, 10% of cases of a cancer are caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some types of a cancer remain absolutely inexplicable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian association of a cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite reduction of number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is connected from 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is risk factor for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It does enormous harm to human health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today in Quebec 1,5 million smokers are", - press secretary Andrée Beaulieu speaks.</seg>
<seg id="33">The encouraging fact: in 10 years after refusal of smoking to die risk from cancer decreases half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to CARAT data, the excess weight and obesity also promote emergence of a disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase risk of emergence of a cancer of a mammary gland, thick and a rectum, a gullet, a pancreas and a uterus.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Researches show that regular physical activity during all life protects from a cancer of a thick gut", - add in Association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The association also recommends to limit consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large numbers it increases risks of emergence of a cancer of thick intestines.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is necessary to avoid also sausage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Meat preservation by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to formation of cancerogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The last can do harm to cages of an organism and lead to cancer development", - explain in Association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years many scientists were engaged in research of influence of vitamin additives on cancer development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But at present it is impossible to call results of these researches unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to SCC, researches of vitamin E yield inconsistent results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed decrease in risk of development of a cancer of a prostate, another yielded opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In an assessment of influence on development of a cancer of vitamin D also there is no full clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">However Mr. Bolyyo emphasizes that it is important to discuss the alarms and the family anamnesis with the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Delivery of the analysis doesn't lead to a cancer".</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgs's boson in details</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Past summer the message that the scientist, probably, was succeeded to find Higgs's boson, caused a big agiotage - and not without the bases.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is considered that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, neither more nor less.</seg>
<seg id="4">Besides, it is the last particle which existence was predicted within Standard model - our the best, or, in any case, the "least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of a matter, - but which didn't manage to be found by practical consideration earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physicists isn't up to the end assured yet that it is a question of Higgs's boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without a doubt shadow that we deal with really new particle and that it bears a strong resemblance to Higgs's predicted by Standard model the boson.</seg>
<seg id="7">Besides, the new data presented this week on one large physical congress in Kyoto, apparently, it confirm though for full confidence of some data yet doesn't get.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Let's present nevertheless that it is a question of Higgs's boson as chances to be mistaken seem minimum, and we will look that it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Is, in this world one law absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't appear in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">To bypass this rule there is no opportunity, don't try at all too diligent, differently do much harm to itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But though the physics of elementary particles is quite strange world, it appears that in it too there is one law of similar character: the principle of an exception of Pauli which postulates that two particles can't occupy the same space in the same timepoint if they stay in same "a quantum condition" is "condition" consists, in general, in their some characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Proceeding from it, physics divides particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find the respectable citizens called by fermions who reasonably submit to Pauli's principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">In other bosons, a mean gang of anarchists which have no respect for anything - at least to this principle that means fuss that they can appear very quietly in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As reports a site (by the way, absolutely unusual) Berkeley Laboratory Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: мезоны about which we here won't speak, and "force particles" by means of which the main forces of nature extend and to which Higgs's boson in some way concerns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons, it is necessary to emphasize, not all such exotic beings as it would be possible to think.</seg>
<seg id="17">Actually, if you manage to read this chronicle, it thanks to one improbably banal boson: to photon, or "light particle" which is "courier" of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Really, when one particle having an electric charge, is accelerated or changes the direction, it "breaks" an electromagnetic field in this concrete place, approximately as a stone thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "violations" the electromagnetic wave (light, either the infrared radiation, or an ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is than other, as a photon - and, therefore, one of bosons of "force carriers".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Stabler field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same happens and to Higgs's boson, to that only a difference that in order that this boson appeared, other field, Higgs's sex has to be "broken".</seg>
<seg id="22">However Higgs's sex much more, is much stabler than an electromagnetic field; that to raise it, it is necessary to reach very much and very high energiya as though it was a question of the frozen pond which surface very big stone could shake only.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why the huge accelerator of particles, as what is exploited in ЦЕРНе - a Large Hadron Collider being a ring with a diameter of 27 km is necessary! - for achievement of such huge energiya.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy to an electromagnetic field is useful as well to a ratio explanation between Higgs's boson and weight.</seg>
<seg id="25">Actually, not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, interact, others - no: the sheet of paper, for example, itself will never keep on the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the same way, not all particles interact with Higgs's field: what interact, have the weight whereas others (as a photon, by the way) have no it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what "can bring" all these researches, Mrs. Plamondon asks?</seg>
<seg id="29">In science they are used for check of correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physics to grope a divergence between results of supervision and forecasts See.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides some of them passionately thirst that such divergence was found since the slightest discrepancy can open a door for "new physics" and stop up some holes of Model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The last, it is necessary to tell, still has essential shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravitation (oh! ) or for a dark matter which forms about 80% of the Universe (very oh! ) .</seg>
<seg id="32">But while in ЦЕРНе such divergences didn't find.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For an everyday life of the average person it is more difficult to predict advantage of these researches, but would be a mistake to assume that it isn't present.</seg>
<seg id="35">You look: at the very beginning of the 60th years pioneers of researches of the laser in Bell's laboratories couldn't even assume, what revolution will be caused by their works.</seg>
<seg id="36">They expected their appendices in science, but no more than that.</seg>
<seg id="37">Really, already late physicist Uillard Boyle who worked in Bell's Laboratories where in 1960 the laser and who itself developed the first continuous laser (previous was invented were pulse) in 1962, I said that originally the laser was considered rather as "a laboratory gadget".</seg>
<seg id="38">Present...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides, the appendix can be for the tools accompanying research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during the optical researches in 1969 developed the small sensor of light.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor though it at all wasn't its initial mission, serves now as "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize on physics of 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">It, certainly, doesn't mean that work of the Large Hadron Collider will surely change our life, but it only shows, actually, that everything can be.</seg>

<seg id="1">The palliative help - the best way to die... | "Debt"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the Commission for worthy death in Quebec the delicate question of the end of life recently was discussed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Debate soon has to be resumed, and the bill at this time prepares.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless in this major area a lot of things still should be made.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Debt" tried to look closer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Only several weeks ago mister L. still lived one in the apartment in Monterezhi.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cancer of a prostate destroying it from within, granted it a delay for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was given five years, I lived seven", - he speaks, between life and death, lying in a bed in a shelter of palliative leaving Victor-Gadbua in Grow white where arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it always shock, it is impossible to be prepared for it", - he speaks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The illness does the work: improbable weakness which doesn't allow to go independently to a toilet and even independently to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at a table on which there is an appetizing dinner, he is given and agrees that to it helped to accept food.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is invigorated, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work round it, bring it drugs, conduct it in a bathtub.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage before usual death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My biggest desire that me cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating", - he admits.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some hours later the personnel I found medicine for this illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"During life us teach that the man has to urinate standing", - Pierre Brodeur, the psychologist in Victor-Gadbua shelter tells.</seg>
<seg id="17">To regress to a condition of the child - for some intolerable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"Everything depends on ability of the person" to reconcile to decline, - he claims.</seg>
<seg id="19">As, according to many people who are engaged in palliative leaving, important events случаяются and in the heat of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who arrive in a palliative shelter Victor-Gadbua, everything are suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts allocate for them at most three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses doesn't provide more the help called by "medical".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Mrs. A., 89 years, most of all are afraid to die "in consciousness of asthma".</seg>
<seg id="24">But the illness allowed me to recognize the children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children", - she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I more want nothing in life", - she speaks before allowing to deliver it a mask facilitating breath.</seg>
<seg id="27">She still waits in the next few days for the last visit of the son who has arrived from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In a shelter Victor-Gadbua by means of group of volunteers give care of a body and the help at a food.</seg>
<seg id="29">It also is palliative leaving which remains when nothing more can be made.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make death of more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec one place is the share of each 11 700 inhabitants in establishments of the palliative help.</seg>
<seg id="32">It isn't enough of it, considering that sooner or later all of us will die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life goes on in the best conditions what are possible, doctor Christian Martel - one of doctors of a shelter explains.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether it be comfort physical, emotional or sincere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Dying we will agree to provide oral rinsings from brandy or Pepsi, looking that he will ask.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics we any more don't force to supervise sugar level.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the death is part of daily occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., which died tonight.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the morning his son drank up this beer in feet at the dead.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help relatives as well as patients", - are told by Natali Savart, the director of care of patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In a shelter Victor-Gadbua any day isn't similar to the previous.</seg>
<seg id="42">Near the 93-year-old old man who enjoys the last meeting with a family in a yard, having settled down on the pillows during a toast in his honor, the young man of 36 years surrounded with parents, the wife and two small children and pereprobovashiya everything tragicly dies to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"In the last half a year from three to five beds, are always occupied by cancer patients aged till 45 years", - doctor Christian Martel anxiously speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients accepted in a shelter Victor-Gadbua, arrive from the house, and 47% from hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative leaving</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is considered that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative leaving, that is to care which is given to alleviate suffering of the patients who have entered into a final stage of their life, whether it be at home, in hospital or in a shelter.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some establishments, such as a shelter Victor-Gadbua and Society of palliative home care of Big Montreal, specialize more or less only on care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">This big gap in health system of Quebec forces many doctors - specialists in palliative leaving to be afraid of the adoption of law legalizing euthanasia and the help in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October the manifesto signed by stars in the field of palliative leaving, doctor Balfur Mauntom and doctor Bernard Lyapuantom and testifying to their disagreement with a similar initiative circulates.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to the doctor Christian Martel, the health system of Quebec is insufficiently effective to provide the right to quality palliative leaving before transition will be allowed for euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, - she speaks, - I saw the patient who spent 14 days in ambulance office, in terrible pains, and nobody took necessary measures that to facilitate them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am afraid that patients wish to die only because they don't receive adequate leaving.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists till last day try to rescue patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes of Elaine Richard's survival already were minimum when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told to my oncologist that I stop treatment, she answered me that regrets that I stop fight, - she tells.</seg>
<seg id="56">Thus she said to me that my days are numbered!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Omnipotent leaving isn't present</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Doctor Martel considers that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank medical staff, that they didn't satisfy their request after the team on palliative leaving relieves their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However it should be noted that palliative leaving isn't absolutely omnipotent in fight against pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsie Monro, the director of palliative leaving in the society of palliative home care of Big Montreal, patients aren't susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life doctors often resort to a palliative sedation at which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or is constant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">It is impossible to pretend to be more that we don't know about these sufferings.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The officials responsible for a construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of means of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia tell day after day that they know about the enormous "system" entangling the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade-union figures and the mafioso.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Industry" which very much cost much to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is curious as this system is scattered after all means were put on use, Jacques Dyusheno, the deputy and the former police chief of Montreal" jokes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly thanks to it in 2011 scandal as a by-product of investigation of the malfeasances connected with road-building contracts in Quebec on which the prime minister of that time from liberals, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly burst.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Dyusheno's report" established direct connection between the industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the investigation beginning in 2010, he emphasizes, one only the Ministry of transport would keep billion dollars on contracts" if some constrained the instincts to take a share.</seg>
<seg id="8">Charbonneau's commission "already displaced two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will manage "to open the schemes standing behind individuals".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Constant division on the fight against corruption, created in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Constant division created in 2011 was connected to business on fight against corruption which structure included the extensive staff of governmental auditors, investigators and analysts.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, besides, the staff of special division "Hammer" who after 2009 forced "waste cartel" Montreal to stop overestimate of cost of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the last weeks a series of searches, and to some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Rishar Marcotte - the mayor of the small town was made, accusations of fraud and corruption were brought.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On turn - Giles Vayankur who has recently retired from a post of mayor Laval, the third largest city of the Province of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">It suspect of numerous receiving bribes at placement of the state orders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Besides, official accusation was brought to several engineers of service of means of communication of Montreal and construction contractors of the Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The last blew up the real bomb, having told to a consequence about "system" of obtaining the state contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Within several years Zambito gave 3% from the cost of the contracts signed in Montreal, to the certain intermediary connected with a mafia who, in turn, transferred money of party of mayor Géralde Trambl "United Montreal".</seg>
<seg id="18">In the 2000th years Zambito squandered money to the right and on the left. He transferred more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to various parties of the province, generally to the liberals who were then in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">Besides, he admitted that illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from Natali Normando's Liberal party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Sewer contracts in which overestimated cost</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal "system" of corruption worked smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="22">Giles Syurprenan, the former civil engineering engineer, in details described it before the commission: in ten years he received from civil engineering firms of gifts, invitations in trips, on tournaments on golf, in restaurants, and bribes in total for 736 000 dollars in exchange for the sewer contracts, which cost it overestimated by hockey matches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials responsible for a construction of roads, admitted that received on a paw, overestimating accounts by 30-40% by means of false additions.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then one organizer from party of the mayor, Marten Dyumon, accused Mr. to Trambl that it intentionally closed eyes to existence of the parallel budget filling party cash desks with dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">After these revelations Mr. to Trambl retired at the beginning of November, having shipped Montreal in deep crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, sounded the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">The mayor of the district of Rivyer-de-Preri in the east of the island, it resists since 2010 to sale of the municipal site bought for 5 million dollars and resold for... 1,6 million to builders at the height of construction boom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of dirty money in election campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">She says that in investigation which finally will be begun, she "will pull for a thread, allowing to understand the system functioning, teeming with ants to stop gangrene and to define guilty".</seg>
<seg id="30">It characterizes this process as "painful, but positive".</seg>
<seg id="31">We are in process of wound cleaning, but own investigation team and the observer will be necessary for Montreal to avoid return doubtful the practician.</seg>
<seg id="32">As we are moved away houses.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Dyusheno notices for its part that "officials stole hundreds millions dollars", but especially he is disturbed by a role of "the elective officials knowing about this scheme", but not participating in frauds.</seg>
<seg id="35">Considering that the share of dirty money in financing of election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, it jokes: "I was told that it was only pale reflection of reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec suggests to limit to 100 dollars of a donation to parties, but, according to him, it won't change a situation: "While we will strictly not limit elective expenses, in policy there will be dirty money".</seg>
<seg id="37">He demands full reorganization of system of providing the state contracts and financing of parties: "We can't fall below; having safely penetrated into an essence of things, we will be able to build the house on stronger base, with the best control and legality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this history also casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno calls those who laughs, to glance in own yard...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you in PSG achieved unusual scope.</seg>
<seg id="3">How you explain this growth?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be explained with individual consciousness, but can - and new measurement of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">There arrived great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Near them I grow every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technicians also introduced a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors force me to lift level of my game daily.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during a match, it is simpler.</seg>
<seg id="10">In soccer everything occurs very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I don't burn.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the very beginning in the center of preliminary preparation in NIF in Klerfonten and before my arrival to Saint-Etienne I always walked forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you benefit by the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">To replenishment of this summer not to play matches of very high level a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know also that each training is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">It leads to that such player as I, thirst to be up to standard and give all the best to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Besides, Carlo Anchelotti gives support in my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is helped by such deputies, as Claude Makelele who played in the same position, as I.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Anchelotti - a master of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Certainly.</seg>
<seg id="21">Anchelotti inspires respect in all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in the First League to it isn't present equal and it is included into number of the best trainers of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has an extensive experience, and he won many titles with high quality clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">It worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think, it will bring new titles to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I with it had an encouraging conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I departed from the whole series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust which it renders to me, also explains my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think of the first part of a season of PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the First League Lyon took away from us a place of the leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we still on call.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we were effectively qualified in the one eighth ending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What purpose of club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to pass as it is possible further.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on everything can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to tell the word face to face with very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We at first want to finish the first in our group, before Porto to have opportunity to accept a return match in the one eighth ending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Whether there will be able to be a PSG the first-class European club in short-term prospect?</seg>
<seg id="39">It for this purpose already has a budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become large European club, Paris needs to win titles and to fix positions on long-term prospect.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially the PSG have means to make this project real.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not to take a title in the First League how in last season, will be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Certainly, it would be big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we valid hotly wish to catch this champion title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In last season we were close to it.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish the first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points are assumed by a rank of the champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But other team, Monpelye, played even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think, everything will be as it should be.</seg>
<seg id="53">In spite of the fact that fight for a title was entered by such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have forces to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Whether you think, what mass media wait too many from PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that from us expect much, considering, how many was enclosed and what players at us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We completely are ready to it.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we win houses 4-0 against Troyes and us nevertheless find for what to scarify, certainly, it upsets a little.</seg>
<seg id="58">We ask a question that waited first of all from us by people.</seg>
<seg id="59">We never will be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to introduce the game project.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We proved in the Champions League that we can answer modern calls.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester United to which already two seasons don't manage to be passed in the one eighth ending though they too spent huge money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Considering the enclosed sums, we represented you on 15 points ahead already to a winter break.</seg>
<seg id="66">It would be neglect to our opponents and to the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille which weren't on the ball in last season, were "woken" by this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">It shows, the First League is how fascinating.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all difficulties, as a result we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG, apparently, completely depends on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's feats.</seg>
<seg id="71">Well and that if say that there is certain "Zlatanozavisimost".</seg>
<seg id="72">It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">It came for this purpose and it proves that it a star of the First League.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he is the great player and a global star.</seg>
<seg id="75">In group we respect it as the person and as player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He too respects people who surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">That it made, it is valid only.</seg>
<seg id="78">It stimulates also others to improve the game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Tyago Silva who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How you endured Euro-2012 from French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I hotly wished to participate in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me to snatch a little game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there many things, and I left from there stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I manage to play good elimination games.</seg>
<seg id="86">It that, on what I hoped from the moment of my baptism at Blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We learned lessons from this that happened in Ukraine, and now have to behave is exemplary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think of the first months of Didier Deshama at the head of Blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They for it are productive.</seg>
<seg id="90">It has good positions in selection group to the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">He is the strict trainer, it is close with players and inspires on a victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Laurent Blan.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I wouldn't want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blan achieved the object, he qualified us in Euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Desham will bring Blue into Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The good deserved draw (1-1) which has been pulled out on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gave us a self-confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everyone battled for all.</seg>
<seg id="99">To this shock in Spain, in my career there were no similar matches.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">To pay and sell without the aid of banks - with Bitcoin</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The complete antithesis to the current monetary exchange based on the Central Banks, the numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission collecting on their processing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Besides, as often there is to these technologies, obviously political vision: belief that the present currency system consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Actually, Bitcoin, the invented Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), at the same time is virtual currency (but converted in dollars, euro... ) and the protected protocol of an exchange as BitTorrent which allows to carry out file exchange between participants of one level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200 000 operations were already registered from 15 000 computers in a network.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some thousand sites accept биткойны for implementation of donations or as means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Course биткойна, having reached a maximum in 30 dollars (23 euros) in the June, 2011, five months later I fell to 2 dollars before coming back today approximately to ten dollars (courses are specified on a site bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Anything special in comparison with a world exchange of real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in the report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes биткойн as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with dollar or euro" and "similar to usual currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as utilized for advance in video game who are earned in the course of game or which are possible for buying (and sometimes and to exchange "credits").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also developed similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But exchange operations always supervises and processes any central body.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Bitkoyn all knots of a network are at the same time holders of the account book, auditors, issuers of currency, pokupately and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How this network functions?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only for each new payment the user can choose other address, providing thus anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The set of information relating to this transaction, is signed elektronno, with use of system of enciphering with a double key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network also can check authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to file contents, it is possible to check that биткойны, used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounts book dispatched on all network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Key stage is registration of new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It passes through the solution of the mathematical task dispatched to computers, solved which as if the temporary central bank, receives the privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a question of a phase of hashing of the file, that is transformation of the big file to the digital signature, short and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers "take" new transaction and add it number before "hashing" everything together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The purpose consists in finding number which will give the unique digital signature (many zero at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number is found, other knots easily check that it is correct.</seg>
<seg id="27">Transaction thus is nerarzryvno connected with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If for the purpose of deception the user very quickly (less than in ten minutes) wishes to pay two times one and to a subject the money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed with a network - and another would remain unconfirmed as they have different digital signatures.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer which has solved a problem, receives 50 биткойнов.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, the award is regularly halved probably until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number биткойнов in the address therefore is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred-million that leaves still a reserve...</seg>
<seg id="32">Complexity of a task also increases with increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Network life already endured take-off and falling.</seg>
<seg id="34">The sites rendering the services Bitcoin, were attacked, and биткойны were stolen from reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The used defect doesn't concern the protocol", - Pierre Nuaza who started recently Paymium - the company carrying out payments by real money with Bitcoin network use assures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The European Central Bank reported also about possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But cash also possesses this shortcoming.</seg>
<seg id="38">Large players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations such.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as WordPress blogging platform, resolve them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently Adie Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizman's Institute in Israel, analysed the accounts book and found out that nearly 80% биткойнов don't happen in a turn.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Huge sales" were declared in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jón Holmkvist working in Coinabul which is engaged in converting биткойнов in gold rejoices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Nuaza, other author of a grant on this currency, firmly trusts in the potential of this technology as an operational network.</seg>
<seg id="44">Its system, Paytunia, is an equivalent of a credit card (in the real money) or contactless payment via the mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin for check of transactions that thus leaves cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The owner supervises the personal data better and can be anonymous thus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is simple in realization for businessmen who don't need to install new devices or the software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is enough to report only the address which can be "photographed and distinguished" phone, Pierre Nuaza specifies, assuring that it has already thousands users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is the general tendency of revision of hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before Bitcoin will be approved, will pass some time, but 2013 can become a turning point", - he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The European Central Bank in the report assumes to reconsider, by the way, the various risks which are considered today as raised, in case of success of this system.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">We left Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2">What's next?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The French armies left the zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).</seg>
<seg id="4">NATO and Americans have to follow them at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the Afghan army time came to return itself control over the territory, and for Afghans to choose the future, without hoping only for us.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Afghan peasants whom we considered as terrorists suffered from us generally.</seg>
<seg id="7">And ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, both wounded and crippled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The taliban consists of foreign extremists, the former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also is frequent from peasants who reject presence of foreign army as it was at the USSR.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to protect the traditions, old and archaic even if dzhikhadist, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.</seg>
<seg id="10">Them suffer, they are helped sometimes by local insurgents, but they any more won't be as soon as the West will begin to behave more delicately.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leaving of the French armies from base Nidzhrab which I observed from height of hills set with almond trees thanks to the French credits, passed in an order.</seg>
<seg id="12">Escorts of trucks and armored machinery accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Since the end of 2014 of invasion of Talibs to Kabul won't be.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances changed since their insuperable advance from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">At that time Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of fight between various groups.</seg>
<seg id="16">The capture under country control then was perceived by them as some kind of release, return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghan women paid for obscurantism of these peasants in which they were surpassed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation didn't improve and today.</seg>
<seg id="18">The former Mujahideens, the Afghan government and present Talibs are uniform in the desire to hold women in the subordinated situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main characters of anti-Soviet war returned to the power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They turned into the businessmen seizing the state lands to resell them under building to the repatriates who have come back from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American contracts of a subcontract.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are discredited; the majority of them, by the way, even weren't at war.</seg>
<seg id="22">People as I heard in rural areas, want the government which would consist not of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave as those who managed the American generosity will leave: outflow of the capitals is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Young people were tired of war and its ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its advantages.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65% of the population are in age till 25 years; in Kabul 5 million inhabitants, the one fifth general population now are.</seg>
<seg id="27">Public schools in the cities are filled, both boys, and girls.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is necessary to provide with workplaces of these young people which won't want to come back neither to obscurantism of old parties, nor to corruption of some heads.</seg>
<seg id="29">Everything, including the armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap operas which represent the modern world and which look everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the moment the army is.</seg>
<seg id="31">The authorities which will order it, whether will be considered as the legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">The old commanders conducting anti-Soviet fight, already take measures to restoration of provincial teams which wouldn't submit to the central power.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, highland, with strong local distinctions, has to be decentralized to a certain degree, on a sample of the western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into the centralized state with the strong presidential power, eliminating a post of the prime minister which existed since the Constitution of 1964.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai doesn't want foreign control, in particular before the elections planned for April, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But its country, since 50th years, and even earlier, depends on the foreign help.</seg>
<seg id="36">The industry wasn't put on the feet, any dam doesn't function, any irrigational system isn't repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; it is made nothing, except vegetables and fruit.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority is given to a private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the country destroyed on thirty years of war, the state control over infrastructure would be necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Hearings went that Afghanistan possesses huge mineral riches.</seg>
<seg id="41">It only strengthened feeling that the western countries were present there, only that to take control of them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy for processing of iron ore or copper on a place, out-of-pocket transportation that to export them through mountains, isn't present mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">Chinese already almost left a field of copper of Month Aynak, having left the international archeologists (financed World bank) to dig out a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the largest employers of the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is necessary also that one fine day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan on which in big degree import and export depend, restored the normal relations.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">Difficult confinement of the Constitution of Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new risky step of president Mohammed Mursi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the constitutional declaration which temporarily confers it emergency powers, it decided to go for broke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Having taken all unawares, he declared on Wednesday that the Constituent assembly will vote in the final text next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a week ago the head of state provided to Meeting two additional months to finish work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon two years as Egypt is guided by the preliminary text to which amendments were several times made that weakens institutional stability and conducts to legal contradictions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only strengthened country division.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the President persists in the "autocratic nonsense", continuing "to break this word" and "to violate the right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Of camp of his followers are sure that it is a way to finish institutional and political crisis, having accelerated transient.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum has to be held within fifteen days.</seg>
<seg id="11">Very short period of time which forces Brothers to refuse intention to explain to Egyptians the text, article behind article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president it also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy while the discontent storms over all country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi, apparently, is convinced that Egyptians will vote positively as he declared in one interview to the American Time weekly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially as the appeal to the accelerated vote resembles the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave to myself emergency powers" which as it is supposed, have to come to the end after adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent assembly, generally Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of liberals didn't respond to a call.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they left in a huff, feeling the opinion isn't able to inform.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of defenders of human rights, religious minority or civil society made the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">That the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hasty added yesterday in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">No wonder that in most cases articles were проголосованы unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators were amused, by the way, by that fact that one of the few disagreements of day arose around... time for a prayer as some members of the committee considered that hours of the Constituent assembly were incorrectly adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text in which yesterday still there was a vote, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Object of general attention, article 2 finally remained to identical article from the Constitution of 1971 saying that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of the right".</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafistsky parties for which introduction of the Islamic right is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules" that would give the chance of their more strict application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For Islamists that fact that this article wasn't changed, is the sign of their good will and respect for other participants of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy", - liberals who see in it only public relations answer.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their opinion, Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point in particular to article 220 which grants to university Al-Azkhar an advisory role, in particular, in that, as for check of compliance of laws to Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist in Egypt Sofie Pomye, it causes alarm since "the people, urged to make decisions, aren't elected and have no democratic legitimacy".</seg>
<seg id="31">We can observe theocracy origin".</seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals are besides excited by the fact that the following rector of this university, seemingly, will be much less moderate, than present.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the moment there is no concrete religious intervention.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we remain within civil law.</seg>
<seg id="35">The majority of lawyers who worked over this text, is not ulama, and people with the university education, some were trained in the French system" - Alexis Bloye who prepares the thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition calms.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he recognizes that "round article 220 there can be an ambiguity as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious lexicon.</seg>
<seg id="37">It belongs in particular to "fikh" [Islamic law, - primas of an edition].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future there can be a question, how civil judges are competent to pass decisions on it".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Besides the religious aspect, the text accepted yesterday, is exposed to criticism as it confers large powers to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they were considerably reduced in comparison with what were at an old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Other disputed issue: powers of army.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to wishes of military, consideration of the defensive budget will take place not in Parliament, and in National council of defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the trial of civilians in warships, despite requests of associations on protection of human rights won't be forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="44">The last also expressed concern concerning the text which they consider pernicious for freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Responsibility for blasphemy is kept, and the insult that can have serious consequences for a freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press from now on is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="46">Besides, any of articles any more doesn't speak about protection of the woman, Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive moment shows a ban of tortures in article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word which didn't appear in the previous Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president had to act last night on television, demonstrations are planned today in the second half of day.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state, in turn, come to streets on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Great and mighty" to Moscow will bring: migrants save money for language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While deputies and human rights activists argue that will give the law on obligatory language testing, in the country already there were the swindlers trading in "phony" certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Annually to Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia there come 13 million guest workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mostly it is citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only purpose - to earn money for maintenance of the families which have remained in the homeland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since December 1 the law according to which each labor migrant will be obliged to pass examination for knowledge of Russian came into force.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this rule works only for those who intends to work in a services sector, housing and communal services, a life and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However over time, - promise in FMS, - tests become obligatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides it is necessary to hand over not only language, but also the Russian history, and legislation bases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The knowledge of language should be confirmed both for receiving, and for work permit extension.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exception works only for citizens of those countries where Russian is a state language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Don't fall under action of the law and the people, in time to receive certificates and diplomas about education before disintegration of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Advantage, hopelessness and protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of examination points will work under the auspices of Institute of Russian of a name of Pushkin, University of friendship of the people, the Moscow State University, St.Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants will be able to hand over tests in all cities; already now in Russia more than 160 such centers opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative about introduction of testing supported both deputies of the State Duma, and FMS.</seg>
<seg id="17">And here human rights activists before the law came into force, many times managed to ask a question in the press: and what it, actually, will give?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change obligation of knowledge of language both for Russians, and for visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, - representatives of migratory service answer, is will allow to reduce number of the people suffering from "labor slavery".</seg>
<seg id="20">The very many speak now about protection of the rights of labor migrants, the head of representation of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev explains.</seg>
<seg id="21">Protection of their rights has to begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only the system of the organized set will allow to solve problems of foreign workers for 90%.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems appear at migrants without a profession, the education, not knowing the language, not having physical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding of language, - Sebelev is sure, - future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who under the guise of the help will put to it "permit" in a terrible close barrack where it and tens to it similar for months will pine without food and documents, sticking for 12-14 hours per day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive a set of complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the homeland to them promise one, and on arrival them deceive, select passports, don't pay the promised salary", - the chief of Head department of labor migration of MS of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov confirms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Don't swear, a nasyalnik!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics gathering for earnings to Russia, admit that not only don't know language of the country to which aspire, but also on the own write hardly.</seg>
<seg id="29">Certainly, it not so much their wine, how many trouble: the few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks are able to afford to get even a sensible primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all at their families there is nothing even to feed children, without speaking about that decently to dress them, to put and equip in school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Growing to teenage age, such children at the first opportunity go on earnings.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of language, - they admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel small also defective".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, concerning the law on language human rights activists note one important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be held only for those migrants who have the legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the status isn't present - won't be neither examination, nor the subsequent official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the most part of guest workers still live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome, or the Stranger the entrance is prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of visitors claim that not so simply to receive the official status in our country.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason - in bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">And here false registration can be made quickly and for only one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Staff of the Russian police knows that we have generally false documents, there is no registration, from here and extortion cases.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Ask one hundred, two on cigarettes, tea", - the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Hushkadamov shared with journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Fly, don't stint, buy painting"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">In the first day of coming into effect of the law on language it became clear that false happen not only migrantsky documents on registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some "phony" certificates on passing of language tests are already withdrawn by employees of FMS.</seg>
<seg id="48">Counterfeit papers are printed on the ordinary color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Certainly, new owners got them not for nothing: each of the migrants hoping thus to facilitate to a problem of passing of tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is more than two times more expensive than procedure of official testing: it will cost to the labor migrant three thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In that the main task on the near future - to protect system from corruption that "crusts" couldn't be bought simply, meet both authorities, and human rights activists.</seg>
<seg id="52">While the authorities can promise to the guest workers who haven't managed successfully to pass test from the first, time for studying of a basic language course.</seg>
<seg id="53">Besides, to the visitors who aren't knowing the Russian, work in the spheres which aren't assuming active communication with people will be offered.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">The following look of "the black weapon" - stolen by criminals at representatives of power structures.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranets explains that here enter and carried away from police warehouses, and stolen from directly law enforcement officers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal "trunks" go to sale from military warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military warehouses often there were explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There are proved versions that part of arsons were made specially - to cover shortage", - the former military speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The contribution, according to Barants, producers of the weapon bring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Now private small-arms factories which don't maintain the competition in the international market propagate and throw out the weapon covertly on the black market, including Moscow", - the expert tells.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">One more source of the "black" market - smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Especially arrives guns and machine guns from the poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan much.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is the production, sometimes handicraft, and the mafia which organized a stream" was formed, - the former military explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">From where weapon?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts counted, what approximate share of each of sources of deliveries of the illegal weapon on the "black" market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The report on it in 2011 prepared the Center of the problem analysis and state and administrative design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Experts analysed the reporting of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapon subject.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Overwhelming part of the illegal weapon, researchers write, arrives from army and power departments.</seg>
<seg id="35">A half of all weapon in the black market appeared there "because of officials, whose work is connected with the weapon", is spoken in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to researchers, 17% of cases the weapon arrives from places of armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there are plunders at a weapon production phase, 5% are the share of "black archeology".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The selling assistant of one of the weapon shops, asked not to call its surname, assures that the weapon found black diggers, for a long time nobody buys - is too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most often, as he speaks, behind new party sellers go on a military warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="39">Through the ensign of people buys unit, for example the gun TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">To it write out it, transfer through a zaborchik.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It transports it to the city and here sells for 900 euros apiece with two shops", - he tells</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"However, the police in a course of all affairs therefore periodically when the plan on solvability of crimes burns, carries out control purchase at dealers in the illegal weapon", - the consultant adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"As in magnificent shop"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I looked on sites, in blogs, the companion who suggested to arrive on the Running platform where there will be a person who will take away me in "corner" where we will bargain didn't respond yet.</seg>
<seg id="46">I learned the trunk price only there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">military observer Victor Baranets</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To get a trunk the acquaintance who has an exit is necessary to me, - the selling assistant tells. - I have such acquaintance, but I am not confident in him.</seg>
<seg id="49">Sellers in the markets are, but there too it is necessary to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich who asked to tell that at the daughter tooth dropped out".</seg>
<seg id="50">I now even get couple of brass knuckles through the person in whom it is confident.</seg>
<seg id="51">It too delivers them only to me because knows that I won't hand over it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Beginners look for the weapon different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military Victor Baranets tested as the buyer of the illegal weapon in the mid-nineties when prepared for the publication article about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">Schemes, according to him, didn't change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It was given an album with photos where was "anything".</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt as in magnificent shop", - the military remembers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">To the buyer, according to Barants, don't offer a pig in a poke - everything can be tried.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, the potential client, not simply buy - we go with the seller to the wood, there we put a target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"To me give the chance to shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon beats well, we start bargaining", - the expert describes procedure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Shop on a sofa</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Searchers on the Internet bring to sites and groups in "VKontakte" where suggest to buy the weapon "for the different purposes".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">For this purpose no documents and personal meetings are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="63">"It is enough to have a certain sum of money", - write in an advertizing cap on a site "Buy a Service Pistol or the Machine Gun".</seg>
<seg id="64">On it users leave the demands and ask questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">And to minors will sell?</seg>
<seg id="66">"Without the license certainly", - user "Ivan" (the spelling is kept) asks.</seg>
<seg id="67">"I will buy Vol. Moscow" - laconically formulates inquiry "Fedorenkov".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The federal security service now разбросила a huge network of false sites and wishing to buy the fighting weapon rows with a shovel.</seg>
<seg id="69">People go as hungry fish on bait, and then extract in Siberia coal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">military observer and former military Victor Baranets</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside action of the Russian laws.</seg>
<seg id="72">People accept orders.</seg>
<seg id="73">The buyer via the ATM pays.</seg>
<seg id="74">"In reply send the photo and the instruction where the weapon" is hidden, - the press secretary of public organization "Right to the Weapon" Dmitry Kislov tells.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Victor Baranets claims that having left the demand on a site, it is possible to remain without the weapon and to get for a lattice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">The federal security service now разбросила a huge network of false sites and wishing to buy the fighting weapon rows with a shovel.</seg>
<seg id="77">"People go as hungry fish on bait, and then extract in Siberia coal", - he claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">Makarov for 100 dollars</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">Upon purchase of illegal small arms, according to the experts, it is possible to keep within the sum from 100 to 900 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="80">According to Dmitry Kislov from the Right to the Weapon organization, Makarov's gun can be got for 100-300 dollars.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">In the USA workers of fast food and supermarkets strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through work on cash desk "McDonald's" passes to a quarter of all American teenagers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days across America the wave of protest actions against low wages in department stores of Walmart corporation and restaurants of popular networks of a fast food, such as "McDonald's", "A burger King", "Tako Bell", "Uendis" and "Kentucky фрайд чикен" swept.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">While nobody undertakes to predict, whether this wave will turn into the highest wave or she is fated to exhaust at early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Actions support labor unions and a number of the left public organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Except increase of modest wages which are got by ordinary workers of Walmart and system of a fast food, the purpose of organizers of protests is creation in them the trade-union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this sector of economy isn't captured almost by trade-union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, in so-called "Black Friday" when the orgy of the cheap sales which has taken million inhabitants and sometimes accompanied fights fell upon America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">This day some employees of Walmart corporation in which 2,2 million people worldwide work, left the workplaces and picketed together with labor unions and the left activists corporation shops, whose goods are calculated on people of modest and average prosperity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart trades in everything on light, from diapers, hunting guns and automobile batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its shops are on the average from 8% to 27% cheaper, than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore many low-paid workers of Walmart do shopping only at themselves at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Availability and the range of goods made Walmart of one of the largest corporations of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart is able to afford to sell goods to a podeshevka partly because pays to the workers a little.</seg>
<seg id="16">The last also complain of severe conditions of work, for example, on shortage of auto-loaders or manual scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Participants of actions on "Black Friday" demanded to raise a salary and complained that the cost of the medical insurance provided by corporation, jumped up with 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too expensive for the typical worker of Walmart receiving 9,5 dollars at an o'clock, this expense, they spoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the Californian university in Berkeley prove that if Walmart will raise a srednuy salary to 12 dollars at an o'clock, it will cost corporations 3,2 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is about 1,1% more, than it spends for a salary now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart entirely shifts growth of salaries to shoulders of buyers, each visit to shop will manage them only 46 cents more expensively.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a year they will spend for any 12,39 dollars more, than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart note enough that protest actions happened in only nine states and didn't put corporation the slightest damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" proceeded in its shops from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 goods in a second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of corporation Dan Fogelman claimed in interview to the left site Huffington Post that workplaces were left in total by "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that protest action was only "the next PR trick" labor union which has organized it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free cash desk!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests proceeded this week in New York where not Walmart department stores (them in this progressive city were their object don't favor and therefore they here while aren't present), and "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The McDonald's says that it sells billion portions and after that it at all doesn't give you sick-lists and doesn't pay to you for honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Dzhumeyn Williams, member of the City Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At present the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York legislation, makes 7,25 dollars in hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Restaurants of a fast food raise it over time, but not much more, and on the average their ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars in hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less they in this expensive city aren't earned by anybody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As it is possible to exist in New York on such money, for me it is incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through "McDonald's" passed almost a quarter of the American teenagers who earned additionally behind their counters after school, living thus at parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Very few people saw in it the main source of livelihood or planned to be late there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now I constantly encounter interview to employees of "McDonald's" who complain that have to live for this salary and sometimes even feed on it children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, at a forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper the comment which author notices hangs that irresponsibly to bring children if you don't know, on what you will feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants of protest actions who began in 6.30 mornings on Thursday at "McDonald's" on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that at least 15 dollars at an o'clock started paying to cashiers and cooks of system of a fast food, that is more than doubled their present minimum earnings.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that in the sphere of a fast food the trade-union organizations were created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The American law forbids administration to it to interfere and to punish activists of trade-union movement by cavils and dismissals.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration seldom facilitates them life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But it is difficult to capture labor union a fast food and for the objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main - unusual turnover of staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The discordant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place this day and at some other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of an action was in the middle of the day meeting at "McDonald's" near Times Square on which some local democrat politicians, in particular, the member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams who has declared acted: "McDonald's" says that it sells billion portions and after that it at all doesn't give you sick-lists and doesn't pay to you for honest work! ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Demonstrators were supported also by other prominent New York democrats, for example, the candidate for a post of the mayor Bill De Blasio who has declared that "we have to enter amicably support of workers of a fast food they achieved fair payment and economic wellbeing which is deserved by each New Yorker! ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As characterized New York Times event, it was the largest action such in the history of the American sphere of a fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But some hundred people participated in it, besides not all from them were workers of a fast public catering in which in New York tens of thousands of people are occupied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">While it isn't clear, whether this spark will generate a flame of a grass-roots movement.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"While to deceive a brain it turns out so-so"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among admirers of modern technologies the augmented reality subject can be perceived recently generally through a prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">At first in the summer at the annual conference Google showed the working model, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was submitted also by Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However from conversation with the head of group interactive 3D - technologies in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharamom Izadi follows that for scientists of this company points - the passable stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">They accept prospect of manipulation with virtual objects in air barehanded, creations of virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Tell, please, in general, than your research group is engaged?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are engaged in interaction of the person with cars, but thus we try to move apart borders of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the mankind in weight got stuck at a work stage with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes tykanye in them a finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to glance for 5-10 years forward and to foresee cardinal changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the prefix of Xbox and sensors of Kinect is a step forward, and almost any Xbox without Kinect isn't on sale today, after all everything interestingly sign management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What for us waits ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- In spite of the fact that Kinect transferred interaction to physical level, a lot of things still occur on the flat screen, sometimes in the 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">Input of information improved (the system obtains more data), and a conclusion yet very much.</seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change it, we work over truly three-dimensional systems of display on the basis of various technologies, including projective.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to let out the computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose, however, it is necessary to distinguish not only the user, but also space round it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And first of all - to hell these foolish helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about voice-activated control?</seg>
<seg id="20">Popular piece, but whether overestimate it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- Definitely it is impossible to call it panacea - there is a privacy question because not always there is a wish to inform people around on the actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Actually all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in the niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for management of devices in public places we had a project within which we thought over gestures, but not over wide, and over such avaricious, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thus gestures were removed not the device camera, and a wrist bracelet which fixed movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">While it big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general the future behind the mixed type of management, for example, жест+голос.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- It as?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how you ask me to transfer you this to aerated water bank?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will tell and at the same time you will show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually simply speak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, it will be very difficult to be distinguished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- That is you want to force users to adapt under what can or the car can't at present?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Absolutely optional, but this mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think, soon we generally should work over development of new types of sensors which will allow to define more precisely than reaction of the person.</seg>
<seg id="35">It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give quite good permission on depth, it is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If to speak about your work with sensors of Xbox Kinect, what claims at you to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is no permission, depth or still something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle the present generation is from what it is possible to make a start in our work on three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Certainly, it is good to receive megapixels 8 with a speed of 1000 fps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it isn't megapixels, and as a matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From the last point of view all present technologies for us are insufficiently good is adds works to designers of algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is it is necessary to remember not only about permission on axes X and Y, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the speed, number of frames per second is very important.</seg>
<seg id="44">Movements of the person are quite dynamic, and present 30 fps is frankly small, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes made a contact sensor of our Redmondsky laboratory with an adjustable delay of processing - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) indicator.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not all understand as far as it influences interaction of the person and cars.</seg>
<seg id="47">In my work the equivalent of such device which only isn't demanding contacts that frames per second was more very would be useful to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- And the number of cameras doesn't need to be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- In Kinect now there are three "cameras", one of which actually - an infrared radiator, and the second - the receiver of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And here already the third camera is, actually, usual sensor of visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">It isn't applied to determination of depth of object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially bigger number of cameras could solve a problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or to aggravate it, having increased the demanded volume of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be quite good to create flexible analog of Kinect, to be played with curvature of an arrangement of cameras and to look as it will help with three-dimensional definition of situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, I didn't present to public the points.</seg>
<seg id="56">It doesn't seem to you, what from the point of view of daily use of technologies of augmented reality points are one of the most perspective platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Certainly, all the time to walk about, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not so conveniently, but here that I think: the "passing" augmented reality when on the basis of a cloudy platform you could switch over from points to the smartphone, the projective display and further everywhere would be the most cool option.</seg>
<seg id="58">Points - very personal device, in it their force (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness - the augmented reality on the basis of points won't allow you to work over virtual objects together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Let's present for a minute that the manipulation virtual holographic objects in air is available not only to Tony Stark from "Iron Man", but also to the mere mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem to which critics of such idea often point: there is no tactile response!</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group prepares on this call?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In the lectures I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh break in interaction of the person and the car.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think, the additive of tactile feelings can quite become the eighth.</seg>
<seg id="65">While one of interesting tricks - use of the second hand as a peculiar substrate for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It perfectly registers pressing!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies which are really directed on giving here to these "to pictures in air" to tangibility - for example, an interference of several directed ultrasonic beams in a certain point where there is a finger, gives feeling but while it very weak - as though to you blew on small pillows.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bracelets on wrists which influence the nervous terminations in fingers - too the perspective direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- And you tried to deceive a brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">To force it to think that he feels what, it seems, has to feel while he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- Here it is good idea, we yet didn't try to do so.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here one more task with which it is necessary to struggle for a long time - how to force the person who is physically in very limited space is covered to believe that he goes on open, almost infinite - is worked and over concepts of racetracks (not so such, as in clubs), moving platforms, and also huge spheres.</seg>
<seg id="73">While to deceive a brain it turns out so-so, works still very much for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">Here that does work on so attractive virtual reality for the researcher - many things in absolutely rudimentary condition.</seg>

<seg id="13">In this world red color is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.</seg>

<seg id="20">Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and new, free like me were unclear.</seg>
<seg id="21">I began to be on friendly terms with artists of a new wave, with a postgazonevshchina which brought to "Pushkin-10", and more wave wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="22">Me throws into theater, clothes, music, into all genres, except the word.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - And all this united in your Art clinic... - It was important to me to come to be in the center of culture of Petersburg where all best creative power has to gather.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995 I occupied the territory on Pushkin-10, and there, yet there was no repair, there was a musical and artistic club, bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many there were born: NOMY, Tequila jazz, I remember how Cord brought with the Van Gogh's Ear project.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cord and its friends lip-synched easy songs, they were in fitting body stockings, among them there was fashionable nowadays composer Igor Vdovin.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group played alive, it became "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trakhtenberg was the host of many programs till hali-galivsky times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trakhtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and education he at us went received.</seg>
<seg id="30">The D 137 gallery, club "Griboedov is echoes from Art clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">There our workers and frequenters left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am the hero of a yesterday's eyelid when the culture something meant.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000 poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination "Artist of Year" I was called, my culmination came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="35">In new times by old rules it is uncomfortable to work, I am the person of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In our years it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are shared, it is possible to be popular, but not so cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - The recognizable manner is inherent in your works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - My many pictures are hits, in them pronounced relevance and sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have a program exhibition, "The Russian museum in clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns - timeless category.</seg>
<seg id="41">I social was earlier, now to be such it is sick and terrible.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in clowns everything is smeared, the tragic element is removed.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, world rescue by totalitarian disguise in the form of an order.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now on clothes meet, being guided by external mechanics, instead of by the internal person.</seg>
<seg id="46">And, maybe, he can't offer a hand and in an ugly face it is necessary to spit.</seg>
<seg id="47">And deception will be removed by means of disguise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - And recently we saw you as the city organ-grinder. - The cultural city has to have such hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">To whom as not me, to be it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Now commercial art has to be accurate, tactful, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">There is a disintegration of cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier people got off in packs, the bohemia loved one, gawks another.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now all broke into microcommunities, now difficult it will be pleasant to all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to be pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now it is necessary to think it will be pleasant to whom.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now at each cult hero on 100 admirers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - And to Stas Mikhaylov comes on some thousands!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - Broshenka come to it, there the sekso-social sphere works.</seg>
<seg id="60">And on the cultural soil of 300 people will come, and 10 thousand won't come, and as a result there is less than management, money, everything withers.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have admirers, the main thing - them not to deceive, not to spoil the sewed.</seg>
<seg id="62">I wrote such pictures to youth that one collector has them on a wall near Falk and Larionov hung.</seg>
<seg id="63">I began with pictures with which usually finish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Now often confuse concepts.</seg>
<seg id="65">Speak: culture spiritual, culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">There is no culture at consumption, it quite another thing.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am the person of culture of yesterday, grew on examples of artists which lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of drawing of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I for such here culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Kirill that doesn't suffice to Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - Good cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is such concept: the official from culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not each of them can be engaged in culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the correct tsars everything not so was, tsars, maybe, not so understood in culture, but they understood that it is necessary to keep the correct experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">Here in Moscow now good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">We in Petersburg have people which could be experts, but they are pushed as higher experts who will correctly estimate these experts are necessary and will let them pass.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now the vkusovshchinka prospers.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but distinguishes them that they honestly speak what not we accept all modern art, there are such artists who have to look for to myself other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - What is for you - Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - Petersburg is not the cultural capital, in Moscow cultures much more, there the soil is.</seg>
<seg id="80">And on our stones to art raise difficult.</seg>
<seg id="81">The cultural soil is necessary to us, and we now have more than writers, than readers, it is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="82">Here in Europe there are a lot of people curious. which go on exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">At us this layer is thin.</seg>
<seg id="84">We need to make fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is realized on means of a grant of St. Petersburg</seg>

<seg id="2">Earth in danger.</seg>
<seg id="3">Global warming or collision with an asteroid murderer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Caravans of spaceships with people of Earth onboard go on searches of a spare planet.</seg>
<seg id="5">To keep mankind, there is a main issue how to continue the sort in the conditions of zero gravity or on the same spare planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="7">Actually real planets only two which can be mastered at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is Venus and Mars", - the senior research associate of the State astronomical institute of a name of P.K.Shternberg (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin considers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if on Mars conditions more suitable for life, on a surface of Venus - temperature of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is possible to live only at big height or in an orbit of Venus... in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Started approaching to reproduction questions in space from flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Half a century more made experiments on plants back.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations of the peas grown up in an orbit differed nothing from the terrestrial grades.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then - removal in an orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies drosophilas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 to space sent eggs of quails to check how the embryo in the conditions of zero gravity develops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We receive at the exit of absolutely normal baby bird.</seg>
<seg id="17">And here the problem further begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"A problem connected by that this baby bird has to find a support, he has to get up on the legs and start moving", - the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medicobiological Problems (IMP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without having found a support, baby birds randomly somersaulted.</seg>
<seg id="20">And in 10 hours newborns had a full atrophy of instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baby birds didn't react to light and a sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And there the trouble was that in four days they simply perished.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And two times we вылупляли baby birds after that refused because it is simply impossible to work there with them", - state an experiment failure with baby birds in space Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With animals the last time biological "miniark" flied into an orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">However on the Bion biosatellite there will be only same-sex individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats who were sent to space already with a fruit.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there didn't find anything supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It just was on biosatellites, but besides is a single experiment, and such researches should be conducted", - Vladimir Sychev notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After a landing space rats had a posterity.</seg>
<seg id="31">But to approach to a reproduction problem directly in space it doesn't turn out yet.</seg>
<seg id="32">Difficult task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals, losing, habitual habitat, can't simply realize the sexual instinct.</seg>
<seg id="34">The person, unlike animals, in principle, can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ethical reasons similar experiments aren't made.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women fly to space 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Tereshkova had the biggest risk.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the most precious that the mankind has, is a female organism.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Seagull departed, and anybody on Earth couldn't tell: whether it will remain after flight in space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether she will manage to give birth to the child after that flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all nobody answered this question", - the veteran of space-rocket branch Vakhtang Vachnadze speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June, 1964, all in a year after flight in space, the first female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to the daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child Andriyan Nikolaev also was an astronaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988 at the second female astronaut Svetlana Savitskoy who twice has visited an orbit and even worked in outer space, the son was born.</seg>
<seg id="46">However the risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We haven't enough, units is astronauts at whom after long flights everything managed, and the healthy generation grows.</seg>
<seg id="48">"And if it is more, it is dangerous even at orbital flights", - the space pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hera Rossii Valery Polyakov sums up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And still, the mankind needs to look for any new ways in biotechnologies, protection against radiation, creation of artificial gravitation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">TsPK hydrolaboratory - an obligatory stage of preparation for flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts fulfill skills of work in an outer space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water imitates zero gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If for adults water, let and comfortable, but after all the alien environment, for babies - native elements.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ихтиандры as if confirm - life on a land left the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a communication meanwhile that the kid is about 9 months at mother in okoplodny liquid, it is easier to it to get used then to a water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle it is logical because from the birth moment, from the moment of that first bathing, passes only 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"It isn't enough that something to forget", - the instructor of grudnichkovy swimming Marina Aksenova speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In a word, if for the been born child zero gravity more natural state, - is necessary for the woman gravitation, gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Very quickly in zero gravity muscles of a stomach, a basin grow decrepit, ability to fruit pushing out falls.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well it is fine, we will lower also it, relying on stimulators of patrimonial activity.</seg>
<seg id="61">It is possible to go, of course, in the special camera on childbirth, it will push out it.</seg>
<seg id="62">"And further that? " - Valery Polyakov asks uncommon questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, artificial gravitation too is necessary to the child.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without feeling terrestrial gravitation, the organism won't create a skeleton and muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn in an orbit it is impossible as adult, to dress in a special load suit for trainings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will be simply deprived of that to it will be vital.</seg>
<seg id="67">"And this experiment on which we will go, having allowed the birth of the child in the alien environment, will lead to that we will bring to Earth of the disabled person, completely deadapted person", - the head of committee on bioethics of IMBP Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov expects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">While the birth of children in space - a theory question.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, later time it will be reality when people of Earth by the ships will go on a far-out planet which becomes the house for their descendants born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Chief of the Head control and auditing department: Check Schwarz system failed because of politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In branch of government procurements the Czech Republic has good control authorities and, despite existence of the qualitative legislation, lags behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Miroslav Kala's this statement, the vice-president of the Supreme control and auditing management, from interview for a site Aktuáln ě. cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law never will be ideal, but it has to be applied correctly that, in my opinion, at us doesn't suffice", - commented on Kal's current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The similar conclusions are provided by joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of the wrong practice give Peter Nechas's approach to so-called Schwarz system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently the prime minister declared, what CDP (Civil Democratic Party) won't disturb businessmen checks - there is it it is forbidden or it is authorized?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be somehow established, and if it forbids something, and the prime minister can't resist to work of establishments to which it is imputed a duty to check and achieve implementation of obligations", - Kala states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At meeting of auditing committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties within which the legislation on government procurements of both countries was compared.</seg>
<seg id="10">About what specifically there was a speech?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Parallel check which we began, likely, two years ago means.</seg>
<seg id="12">In other words, speech that the European legislation claims how have to pass government procurements, follows further the national legislation and then also application in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All information was collected and, even at even incomplete check, interesting distinctions - in other words were found, we can have a legislation "exact and faultless", however in practice of application we on some parameters concede to Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows from this that it isn't enough to create more and more specified rules, it is necessary to concentrate on application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">And actually as this project can help you, what it means to you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Such joint control can make a contribution to efforts on a stop of specification of laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions because it doesn't lead to positive result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy means receiving the corresponding thing for reasonable (but not always low) the price to avoid enrichment and, probably, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact that we will reach it, having reduced restriction of orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Probably, this system will be overflowed with "papers" so that those who will wish to find openings in this system, will find them much easier than if restriction didn't decrease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You speak about internal problems of practical application of the legislation on government procurements.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how the monitoring system in Germany functions?</seg>
<seg id="22">Whether there is there such organization as our CAM (Control and Auditing Management) or it works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for establishments, there Bundesrechnungshof arranged by our principle acts as our CREWE, also there is a board working a few in a different way, but generally both establishments function similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Besides, powers to a certain degree are similar but as Germany has federal structure, there are divisions of audit and at the level of federal lands - in it their system differs from ours a little.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can operate only federal money, we have public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds in our regions and municipalities are supervised at the level of federal Audit Chambers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the local legislation, there it is simpler, than at us?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I wouldn't want to compare without concrete data, but in certain respects Germany can be imitated, but it is impossible to tell definitely that it is better in everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It so because they cope with control better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely not, but I will repeat, similar comparisons aren't pleasant to me.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to tell, what even the model countries face many problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantage from cooperation with our office, truly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If to speak about the domestic legislation how were reflected in your establishment of the amendment to the Law on government procurements, consequences are somehow shown?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Considering that validity of these amendments is quite short, it still wasn't shown in any way in our works on control.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we carry out control upon, it is necessary to consider some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We take it into account only in the course of preparation of future checks - we started using our new tool "detection of risk of not economy" via which we banished nearly 14000 state contracts. We analysed them. There, of course, these changes will be shown because restrictions change, conditions of some types of tenders and so on change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">How you consider, the adoption of this law will benefit or additional load of bureaucracy system?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law, certainly, a step in the correct direction, and, I hope, it will be confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Problem which can arise, such is that rules "will become tougher" and they can't be observed.</seg>
<seg id="40">When functioning the previous rules the controlled enterprises are tied with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on government procurements means violation of the budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whether it is worth toughening in that case the law in such a way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think, what not this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system has to exclude those who wants to take and abuse, but not to punish those who makes the formal mistake which isn't influencing the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such system only will create still the bigger pressure upon bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And whereas to leave this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's realize that this way anywhere won't bring.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently the prime minister declared that GDP Schwarz system won't disturb businessmen checks so-called. What does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">"Schwarz system" it is forbidden or resolved?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be somehow established, and if it forbids something, and the prime minister can't resist to work of bodies to which it is imputed a duty to check and achieve implementation of obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">One might say: "We will change this law and we will resolve it", but it is impossible to say that we will pretend to be as if occurs nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on government procurements contains quite strict rules as well as that has to be carried out formally, and it is correct. It will protect government procurements.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law never will be ideal, but it has to be applied correctly that, in my opinion, at us doesn't suffice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to save up positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">That do you think what less than in a month there has to come a doomsday?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It only one of many disturbing news on which we, people, so easily come across.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with The Tap Tap group we constantly joke on this subject and we say that we - the only group in the world which will be able to collect rather positive energy to delay or prevent a doomsday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against a doomsday.</seg>
<seg id="6">You could is more detailed to tell about it to readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a question of national action for fund raising which we plan here within two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to use the marketing potential which the calendar Maya about which end it is declared on December 21 at 11:10 possesses.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day before this event, on December 20th at 21:00 in parallel start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will end, roughly speaking, while on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean which time zone at 12 o'clock earlier, than at us, will come to the end a May calendar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To whom did this idea come to mind?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially it was my idea, further all of us thought out together with our artist Hansa Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides that we want to save up rather positive energy and to prevent a doomsday, we also want to think together with the public over in what condition we will give once this world to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the termination of a May calendar we created a unique collection of subjects from footwear, t-shirts, bags and original keys against a doomsday. These things can be bought on a site www.e-tap.cz and by that at the same time to give to us support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The The Tap Tap group together with other musicians also executed the anthem against a doomsday which the doomsday is called "Is cancelled".</seg>
<seg id="16">Whether YouTube already fallen in love to listeners the anthem at these benefit performance concerts will sound?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Certainly, right at the end, if as a result everything turns out and the doomsday won't come.</seg>
<seg id="18">It will be started singing by all performers at all concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anthems at the same time will begin to sound also on the air of the Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Words to this song Tomash Ganak wrote and played Jesus role in the clip, participates performed by also Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">How you started cooperating with them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life as we hold many charitable events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We try to connect them to these projects actively.</seg>
<seg id="24">It appeared that much like to work with us, it is interesting to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On what the proceeds from a concert against a doomsday will go?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">We so work for purchase of the equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year with the civil association Tap at Edlichka's institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers regularly visit students of schools of institute of Edlichka and hold with them cheerful and interesting events.</seg>
<seg id="28">Students have no means to go to teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity thus.</seg>
<seg id="29">Within the project of additional construction of institute of Edlichka in the future there will be separately a building to which we will move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert will make a speech some musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What selection criteria were?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to make the program which will interest all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague Chinaski, as Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dang Bart, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jerzy Sukhi will act.</seg>
<seg id="34">About all details it is possible to learn on a site www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Whether you any similar plan "grandiose actions" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare the interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year we with pleasure would carry out representation in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the USA, very much would like to act in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About the abroad at you serious plans, you already acted in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The The Tap Tap group is a group of people with limited opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics? ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It isn't so terrible as it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their carriages have to travel in a luggage compartment, plus to everything a large number of freight and boxes with tools.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, while coped with it without problems. The Czech airlines Č SA and the British airlines of British Airways always excellently for us were prepared that me how many time surprised.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from where we returned recently, everything passed without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to departures abroad you can compare the different countries from the point of view of availability, the attitude of the public towards disabled people and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">What you faced by the present moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything functions better, than at us, in Russia we became witnesses of that in the east still is at a basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">In comparison with Prague in Moscow there are a lot of barriers, and here in wonder independent movement of the person on an electric wheelchair in the downtown still is.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also there not in a course such banal things how to give way to the disabled person in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, and there already there are public organizations which try to pay attention of people to problems of people with limited opportunities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many things, which level of execution far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to specify that situation improvement always depends on efforts of those people whom it concerns.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with a heavy form of disability independently move on streets, can descend in a toilet, in a museum and anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">There that a large number of people with limited opportunities we take active part in public life, in it them with The Tap Tap a little isn't so widespread we advance!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect of the public or accessibility is an one thing, but at the moment when among us there will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything indeed will start changing.</seg>
<seg id="57">While it is isolated cases - strong-willed persons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The The Tap Tap group is very popular now, but we will return for two years back, what in 1998 you forced it to organize?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered Edlichka's institute as the tutor, round me there were many young people who wanted to be engaged in something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And as I am the musician and I play including a saxophone, together with the colleague organized an interesting musical circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and over time, as our leader Ladya Angelovich speaks, it got out of hand (laughs) a little.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Popularity came only in recent years, or I confuse something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is the truth, we were helped by that we started joining the well-known singers and actively to work over group promotion.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to a conclusion that work which nobody can estimate, in fact as though doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to means of the European union we are able to afford the qualified teachers, the equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Whether there was you a purpose so well to untwist The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the very beginning I felt their potential in ability to make something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="68">In Show business it is full of the things, imitating one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical, all new is accepted with care, and it lasts long.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are very few rare things, but I will dare to tell that Tap Tap one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression at the person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this pity is absolutely excessive because people with limited opportunities aren't any suffering and all thrown persons for whom we have to feel sorry.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people who can live full-fledged life and develop, of course, only provided that they possess necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if at people with disability something turns out, it is shift not only for them, but also for all society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Whether provided success what you the strict head as what you are considered by many?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do work qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and hold a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I consider that it is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people to us come with romantic representation and fly in clouds and when learn that two times a week they have to go on rehearsal, attend training courses and spend much time on the way, very quickly lose enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But so occurs in any group which wants to work and something to reach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Now as a part of The Tap Tap group twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many they were at the beginning in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Ladya Angelovich.</seg>
<seg id="83">We open group, people come and leave, it can't be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="84">For who has desire and will power, our doors are always open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It will take place a day before an expected doomsday, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba stadium, in Brno - in Fléda club and Ostrava - in the Plynojem center with participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">In concert end all three cities connect a teleconference at the time of performance of the song of The Tap Tap "The Doomsday Is Cancelled" group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The purpose of this project - to raise financial funds of 25 million kroner for purchase of the multipurpose barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO at Edlichka's institute in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The ticket for a concert costs 400 kroner, for children till 12 years an entrance free. Tickets can be bought in advance in Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at meeting of ministers of the European space agency Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European space agency as the second country from the countries of the former east block (after the Czech Republic which became the full member of EKA on September 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with EKA in 1994 and within the next years took active part in a number of projects of agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But to space Poland began a way much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before World War II the Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but it not always met understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I will remind, for example, of lecture of A.Shternfeld who presented on December 6, 1933 in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from the innovative work "Introduction to astronautics".</seg>
<seg id="7">Ideas of the young engineer (1905) left audience indifferent, after several years Shternfeld remembered that only doctor Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in France Shternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and André Luisa Hirsh's award for "Introduction in astronautics".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Doctor Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966) about whom it was spoken above, became the great propagandist of astronomy and astronautics later.</seg>
<seg id="10">It published in the Polish magazines of one hundred articles and wrote a number of the books devoted to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomsky I became the known world propagandist of astronautics, and his contribution was estimated including that one of craters on a reverse side of the Moon was called in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 1925 in Poland the railway section car equipped with the rocket engine was constructed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained is unknown, as well as project details.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not it is clear even, for dispersal or for braking of the cart the rocket had to be used.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information on this section car is known only from the press of that era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933 the Polish artillery started reflecting on rocket arrows.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research was carried out by Section of equipment of arms at cooperation with professors Mieczyslaw Volfka and Gustav Mokzhitskim.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the remained materials it is visible that researches reached a stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with arrival of the German armies of work were interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 in the specialized press there was an idea of the photo-electric rocket fighter which was offered by the engineer Rogozinsky, and next year there was a work "The air rocket torpedo and the aviation rocket bomb" the author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotsky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war by all projects of military use of rocketry the Interim scientific and advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated all work was engaged.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of the activity work ended because of the war beginning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The following scientific work devoted to astronautics, appeared in the Polish press after war, thanks to work of the Polish society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time society it is mentioned in November issue of 1954 of the Problemy magazine in which four volume articles on astronautics are published.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them professor of M. Subotovich suggested to organize society which will go in for astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time already projects of artificial satellites grew, and it was clear that space researches - perspective branch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of astronautics (PSA) tried to enter the international federation of astronautics (based in 1951), and in the fall of POA became her full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">And next year the first chairman of POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the vice-chairman of the International federation of astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">At this position it remained to the most death which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 of POA made the significant contribution to development of very successful meteorological RM rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which became the first Polish rocket which has executed scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first RM-1 type was complete in 1957, and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket, capable to overcome distance of 1800 m, was in length about 80 cm, and its weight made less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently the advanced RM-1A version was constructed, and in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovsky waste ground tests of the two-level RM-2 rocket were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="35">This rocket was in length about 1,4 m, and its weight made about 11,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The following version of the rocket was already able to be engaged in the real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could overcome 14,5 km, and supervision over a high-rise wind was its task.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962 further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period between 1962 and 1965 became the successor of the first RM rockets.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as two-level, its total length made 510 cm, and initial weight - 32,5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three types (designated as the Meteor-1А, - 1B and - 1C) which differed with the camera size for the scientific equipment were developed.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1А rocket had space of 0,4 l, the Meteor-1В - 0,34 l, and the Meteor-1С - 0,62л.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range of flight all three types had 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">During the period between 1965 and 1968 in Aviation institute there took place development of the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October, 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was capable to bring a payload weighing 10 kg to height about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then Meteor-2Н versions and the Meteor-3 were constructed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is worth mentioning also the entry of Poland in KOSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and KOSPAR national committee creation by two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Besides, within the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space researches on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second Vladimir Remek's interkosmonavty ambassador.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Cancellation of the law on public works is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week the constitutional court cancelled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resolution caused brisk discussion in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this perspective from broader point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Liberal the focused economic systems in EU, also as well as in the globalized world, are founded on the principle of the multiple, unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect it means that separate economic divisions, national economic systems, are in the constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, nothing limited movement of the private capital together with unrestrained financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of a considerable difference in the cost of labor (salary) there is price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is necessary to understand a condition when the producer by means of delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition to that "forces down" the cost of the competitor with the purpose to take away to itself the most part of the market and, thus, to increase own income as this concept.</seg>
<seg id="10">In mass scale it means for the majority of businessmen or production transfer abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result unemployment in those in the countries, where labor cost, in comparison with others, high increases.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the private capital doesn't bear any social responsibility including for the unemployment made by it, inevitable expenses of the state on social needs grow.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a whole, the situation strengthens unwillingness of misters of businessmen to pay taxes and by that to compensate the public economic and social damage caused by them in a pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well-known that it isn't necessary to provide concrete statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">Inconsiderate methods of the private capital create at the level of economy of the certain states of a situation when the governments of the countries are compelled to enter the competition with each other artificially to lower social level of the population for the purpose of attraction to the country of the foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">Differently, the governments give own population on an arbitrariness to the private capital, despite social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">It finds the reflection first of all in current legislation changes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The purpose is economically to force the the people to obey to dictatorship of the private capital, first of all in the field of a salary.</seg>
<seg id="18">It works as system of economic coercion in case of long unemployment and at the same time serves as the instrument of reduction of the rights of workers in the sphere of the labor legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result poverty level, at the same time and a difference between poor and rich raises.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany some years there is a public distribution of products poor which aren't able to support itself own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people already comes nearer to one million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within increase of competitiveness of the German economy constantly there are cases when the employed people get such wages that the state has to pay extra to them that they received a living wage.</seg>
<seg id="23">Similar scandal became known the public and in case of additional employees of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures practically, undoubtedly, bring in all southern states of EU besides to a condition in which the people being under pressure of catastrophic falling of the social status, are compelled or to emigrate as it was in the 19th century or to exist for a beggarly salary on society boondocks in hope that sometime the private investment capital will come to the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">However it is asked, from where it will undertake?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the capital comes from other EU countries, poverty to move from one country to another, or it won't come in general as the Chinese, the Hindu, the Brazilian, the Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still works for a share of the European salary.</seg>
<seg id="27">It concerns all Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and mass media to nausea claim that the state can't participate in the capital of own economy that the operated economy conducts to economic accident.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital persistently insists that the state shouldn't interfere operating actions with economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Further it is necessary to answer a question, whether the private capital which now is almost operating policy and that whole state, in own selfish purposes works?</seg>
<seg id="31">Definite answer - yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is existence of almost all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">As result we have the hopeless situation which is showing in corruption, providing mutual benefits, in the legislation where practically everything deserves punishment, however isn't a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany a situation such is that the state ministries because of shortage of financial means charge development of bills to private law firms which are densely connected with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power proceeds not from the people as the constitution of the western type says, and from the financial and powerful groups preferring own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that liberal the focused democracy now quickly appears in such situations as it is described by Appian in the work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in Days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state breaks up for a long time, and departments are engaged in violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal receiving favor by means of stones and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">The bribery and corruption prospered without any ban, and люд went on elections with in advance sold voice""... decent people didn't stand at all to a position of the governor, eventually once the state for eight months remained without the consul". . "Seriously started saying that the only rescue in this awful situation is the autocracy and need of a choice of the vigorous person". Appian thought that it will be Pompeii, but Caesar who finally replaced democracy with autocracy became him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As well as in the ancient time, in modern society own reckless interests without public interests prevail.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital already in essence isn't intended for application in the public purposes.</seg>
<seg id="42">The present result doesn't differ from the past: unprecedented decline of elite without any diligence to carry out reforms of deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">Means the reason of emergence of fascist and communistic modes we have to look for in reckless liberalization of economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today lack of these modes and existence of democracy of liberal type can be perceived as a certain pause after which the following round is expected.</seg>
<seg id="45">First of all that the present elite completely ignores consequences in hundreds thousands victims in the future, humanitarian and social disasters which we already now observe, along with crimes against humanity as we know it from an old and modern history is tragic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Cancellation of the law on public works isn't the decision or, at least, not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure of the competition both on international, and at national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be compelled to continue to look for ways for further decrease in social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus this tendency has system character.</seg>
<seg id="49">The decision are target political and social reforms which will allow to strengthen individual share of the state in economy, will strengthen a role of citizens in government and will weaken a monopoly position of the private capital in society in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="4">The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, caused a set of responses.</seg>
<seg id="5">One play for Israel, reasoning its position that it has the right to self-defense, and Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, reasoning it is racism of the Israeli state, the genocide made over the Palestinian Arabs, and to the state of Israel the role of the terrorist state is attributed.</seg>
<seg id="6">I don't want to reflect on the one who in these periodically repeating waves of murders - the criminal and who the victim, eventually, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governed territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and weren't witnesses of the beginning of violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">My purpose is to suggest readers to glance for a curtain, to look at the one to whom first of all 95 years lasting already tension (considering from signing of the Declaration of Balfur in November, 1917) on a small ground of the Middle East serve.</seg>
<seg id="8">My some reasonings are buttressed up historic by facts, some of them are brought on the basis of my own understanding of the one who or what group of people is the main engine of events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of mankind is first of all race for power history.</seg>
<seg id="10">We can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon in every era.</seg>
<seg id="11">That isn't so clear - whether always these people absolutely independently took the steps, or behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to in advance planned purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is necessary to assume that we live during the period when the world wealth is concentrated in hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from them couldn't occur for life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">One which could be considered as the head of an octopus (I don't know, whether there is someone over them, but it isn't excluded) is distinguished from astronomically rich families - Rotshilda.</seg>
<seg id="14">About them don't write much.</seg>
<seg id="15">Certainly.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first news agency (Рейтерс) they bought already in the nineties the 19th centuries to stop the hearings connecting their name with criminal actions in the highest spheres in which shadow they were and which always conducted to strengthening of their power, enhancement of wealth or at the same time both to that, and to another.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have large equity stakes almost in all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in whose central banks they have no the share, they wage or prepare war (before invasion into Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after invasion into Iraq there were 5 countries, after overthrow of Gaddafi remained only four, however at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of the country in hand).</seg>
<seg id="18">Any who tried to resist to this family, died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the central bank behind Rotshildovsky Bank of America, during civil war it started letting out own (understand - governmental) money and it was killed in 1865 at theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">John F. Kennedy started issuing own money and wanted to cancel FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to file a lawsuit against FED for an unbinding of the Great economic crisis in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst of the world power during the period from 1859 to 1871 led to development of the plan of three world wars created by the great mason of the 33rd level by Albert Paykom.</seg>
<seg id="22">Destruction of the monarchic states in Europe was a problem of the first war, the second had to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third has to lead to reduction of the world population approximately to 0,5-1 billion people (such number of slaves will be enough for ensuring their comfort and luxury, and they won't consume many resources), to creation of uniform universal religion (the ekumenizm can't be anything other, except as the precondition for such project) and to final capture of the absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">Method by means of which the group of the richest families led by Rotshildami works, the call of crisis and the subsequent offer of decisions (order ab chao - an order from chaos) is.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these decisions are false and always conduct to situation deterioration (see the basis of FED which had to prevent repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, after they managed to launch World War I by means of murder of the Habsburg successor of an Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand to Sarajevo, they destroyed imperial Russia, having begun a Bolshevist revolyutsiiya.</seg>
<seg id="26">World War I ended sudden, unreasonable in the military and economic relation with capitulation of Germany (any more there was no need of war for destruction of imperial Russia) and, as a result, there was a smashing of the Central European power, Austro-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">For simplification of an unbinding of World War II bankers and politicians created the hidden conflict situation, having imposed on Germany huge military reparations, than created the precondition to radicalization of impoverished masses, then it was necessary to throw only to Germans rather strong, convicting guilty and the Leader proposing simple solutions, further to create multinational Czechoslovakia with strong German minority which had to play, and really played function of the fifth column, when kindling fire of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century of Rotshilda provoked the basis of the Zionist movement which one branch sought to create the Jewish state, it is desirable in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">Balfur's above-mentioned declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first collisions with the local Arab population started happening.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks happened from both parties.</seg>
<seg id="31">World War II flashed, it is difficult to estimate, whether Hitler from chains in which he was kept initially by bankers, or everything escaped that he made, was planned, in any case sufferings of the European Jews in concentration camps created preconditions for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and just as Germany was provoked by military reparations to the 2nd world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create the center of war of the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as well as in World War II, will fall a victim of operations on a front line, already together with Arab or, in other words, the Muslim population of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is as if huge laboratory, a contention and chaos source not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict where the offense generates offense in an infinite chain of violence if everything began with greed of individuals and their aspiration to the world power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, as well as at us, the international bankers palm off on people for vote on elections of exclusively own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The present prime minister of Israel Netanyahu's hawk is a typical example fascist, loyal to the international bankers the politician, doing everything to begin war with Iran, which, thanks to membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization of cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan... ) will threaten to develop into the world conflict, and considering control of Iran over the Strait of Ormuz containing 20% of all world reserves of oil (the navigable corridor makes only 2 miles wide), - also will lead to destruction of world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In what light the words told by David Rockefeller in 1994 are now shown: "Everything that is necessary for us is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order".</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their representation is the world of misters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world where other part of human population serves a handful of the financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.</seg>
<seg id="41">The world where to each been born organism at the birth implant the chip with which it becomes a being being under total control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"Also forces all small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on the right hand or on a forehead a brand, so that the person who isn't marked with a name of that animal, or number of its name, couldn't buy sell.</seg>
<seg id="43">Here in what wisdom: everyone who has a reason, can calculate number of an animal.</seg>
<seg id="44">Because it corresponds to a name human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.</seg>

<seg id="1">Movie "Operation "Slang": When worse than ever, cause Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November, 1979 the crowd of Islamic students demonstrators seized embassy of the USA in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="3">They had to be released in exchange for overthrown Mohammed Reza Pekhlevi's running after revolution in the USA shah which were the patron of his mode within decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For administration of the USA the positive outcome of a situation wasn't assumed - she wasn't able to afford to throw out the shah for a board because it in a root could undermine trust of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However to reach release of hostages in Iran where revolution led to establishment of a theocratic mode, it wasn't able.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was the blow to prestige of the United States which was strengthened by unsuccessful attempt to release hostages force later.</seg>
<seg id="7">The put diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations with mediation of the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their destiny caused houses a wave of solidarity and the anti-Iranian moods.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defeat in Iran substantially promoted Jimmy Carter's defeat on the presidential election of the 1980th year which has come to the end with election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The movie directed by actor Ben Affleck "the Operation "Slang" describes one of episodes of that history which brought to America small victories.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before occupation of embassy six workers managed to run away.</seg>
<seg id="12">After difficult peripetias they finished the way to residences of embassy of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities was succeeded to take away them from Iran, the extravagant legend of cover according to which they left according to the Canadian passports as the members of a film crew who were looking for in the country a place for shootings of the science-fiction epic thus helped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan which was invented by the "evacuation" expert Tony Méndez, demanded cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">That the legend was reliable, in specialized magazines was written about the draft of the movie, press conferences were organized, the invented production company had real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">Operation details long time were kept a secret, the movie, is based on Tony Méndez's memoirs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck movie is a special combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, so-called "movie film opus", history of a successful invention, swindle - an example can be a number of movies about Ouchene's friends.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the movie moods - on the one hand, documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (in credits sign historical photos of events are shown and how the same situations were shown in the movie - big distinctions in it aren't present) constantly change.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the facilitated Hollywood fragments which are crossing with irony and moderate exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then still scenes from headquarters of CIA and other establishments - men in suits discuss a situation at negotiating tables, on ladders of establishments, by phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck remarkably managed to make career restart.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the derided actor I became dear director, and his game ceased to be object of sneers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The operation "slang" its third feature film, after the dark detective story "Farewell, Child, Farewell" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time it is the first movie of Affleck which isn't shot in the hometown of the director - Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The feeling of the atmosphere of a place thus belongs to qualities which ennobled earlier movies of the director over the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck shows it in "Slang" where Tehran is "played" by Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the movie occur on streets, at reconstruction of real events - introductory scenes of falling of embassy impress with the clarity which also transfers emotions of confusion and unexpectedness which arise when somewhere the history suddenly changes.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck and his colleagues reach similar effect in scenes invented (a counterfeit staff on the Teheran market).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is too much processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with that the narration doesn't assume a set of fascinating scenes of cinema value.</seg>
<seg id="33">It quite successfully works with this the little, sometimes something finishes thinking - there all this leaves not so elegantly (a scene in which phone call in America prevents approaching crisis at the airport of Tehran, and a pursuit on a runway look enough artificially).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Lack of "Slang" is the absent-mindedness connected with need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Gudman as the Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, however their characters would deserve bigger space, and they in the movie is far not the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Affleck movie doesn't have enough a little dramatic nature, it is the movie which it is possible to look with moderate interest, estimating statement and the retrostyle recreating thrillers seventieth.</seg>
<seg id="37">But takes hardly.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, it it is enough for a reminder on one, still in a sense live history, and also for the certificate of how ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are exaggerated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules of inflation of balloons, bananas and circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, annually interviewing about the most absurd bank collecting, decided to declare now competition on "the most absurd resolution or the project from EU workshop".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"We were moved to it by the last event in which EU plans to admit a 40 percent quota for women to administrations of the large European companies", - the organizer of a questionnaire Patrick Nager declared to "Right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among absurdnost already nominated on the nomination - the recent decision of the European court on association of a rate of insurance premiums for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Still women had privileges for life insurance because for insurance companies they objectively are less subject to risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"From EU workshop people can nominate further improbable ideas to competition until the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vote will take place until the end of February, 2013", - Nager told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Disputable orders of EU treats, for example, and obligatory addition of biocomponents in fuel that as a result does harm to the nature, and also a ban on use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain rather small amount of dangerous substances, or the directive on the cage size for hens owing to what this year eggs significantly rose in price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Also the actual ban on use of the term "sandwich-type oil" or withdrawal from sale of classical bulbs underwent criticism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Qualitative bananas have to be 14 centimeters long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The all-European device often passes the decision under pressure of this or that trade or industrial lobby which positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of the states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat Veta defends requirements of the banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Interests of a lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the superior quality in the European Union had to reach length 14 cm and didn't dare to show "abnormal curvature".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus the European Commission came true that only harmonizes existing separate national rules which complicated trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">EU, despite resistance of some states, nevertheless softened the standards concerning fruit and vegetables, referring to that existing directives will lead to squandering of products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The candidate for a prize in poll can become and the last year's resolution of EU according to which on sale balloons surely have to be supplied with the prevention that children are more younger than eight years can't inflate them without supervision of adults.</seg>
<seg id="16">EU addressed to the American researches according to which balloons at game are a potential cause of death of children by means of asthma.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similar restriction extends now on children till 14 years which are forbidden to blow in exhibition dudelka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Amusing ideas are born also at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Rather absurd is and governed, concerning European officials: everyone who has any official position in EU, can't, considering sensitivity of a subject for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and has to speak instead "BYuRM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with association of liberal economists "Principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), offered for vote, besides several above the specified absurd rules, for example, the rule of EU about the volume of food stocks in the territory of the member state.</seg>
<seg id="21">EU established the maximum volume of stocks of the food which can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of tinned mushrooms, for what it was threatened by a heavy fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Organizers of a questionnaire were interested also also by idea to pay to some countries that they have no sea, and idea about granting subsidies for the statement for receiving subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas arose in Prague, instead of in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a great disadvantage because we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Let's ask the European Union about compensation", - Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (ChSDP) of that time declared in the fall of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="27">As argument he specified that in the country there was a big crop of grain, and as a result of so-called intervention purchases the state had full warehouses of stocks which needed to be taken out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For that the Czech Republic is far from ports, EU, according to the Oriental carpet, had to pay to us hundreds millions euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">As a result the European commission moved towards the Czech Republic, having organized the tender for grain purchase from the countries which have no outlet to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for receiving a subsidy were offered villages by the Ministry of the regional development, directed by minister Pavel Nemtsem (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go on drawing up the application for subsidies of Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: Freakish orders are an exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Though resolutions in member states easily become object of criticism, effort of EU on regulation, and also on more effective functioning and European Union development, according to many experts, deserve rather a recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Serious problem, according to experts, the cherpaniye of grants of EU on projects which have even no hint on something the general with deepening of the European integration, however which member states achieved at budget discussion is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Causes emotions among Czechs and that as well as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of the traditional products, and she not always wins in this competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Though Czechs after six years of fights with Germans and the Austrians kept the name "Olomoutsky Curd Cakes", however "Tuzemsky rum" which traditions in our country originate in 19 eyelids, our producers had to rename on "Tuzemak".</seg>
<seg id="36">Products from reed distillate, instead of from sugar beet can be called as rum only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of the registered products of EU, along with world famous karlovarsky crackers, a pogorzhelitsky and trshebonsky carp and zhatetsky hop appeared "feta" and "gorgondzola" cheeses, marzipan from the German Luebeck or Parma ham, already, for example.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also pardubitsky gingerbread and gorzhitsky tubules can be proud of the trademark of EU.</seg>

<seg id="1">People want that I preserved the republic, but I am a fan, - Okamura claims.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mister the senator how to the person comes to mind to run for presidency?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't think of that most to become the senator or the president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If at us in the country everything functioned without problems, I anywhere wouldn't stand.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can't look any more as for the last 20 years the country is plundered as thieves here fuss, to people raise taxes and a retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to be the politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that it isn't pleasant to me, I try to find the decision as to change it.</seg>
<seg id="8">And as I already was forty years old and I am the independent person, not relating to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, except how to stand on a post of the senator or the president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential lock.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whether you turn thus a back to people who chose you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I said all the time that I will join in fight for the presidential lock depending on result of elections in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I specified that if I will be chosen as the senator, I will run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My purpose isn't the position, the position is a tool by means of which I can carry out the views.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore I need the greatest influence and the most large powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But difficulty not only that we as the nation grumble at ourselves in the bar or at the TV, but we are thus ready to crush everyone who will try something to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To it mass media which blacken the person and which confuse a freedom of speech to freedom of lie are added.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, about me said that I bribe journalists, or that I was Jerzy Paroubek's adviser.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's pass to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">Fight for the presidential lock you began with theses about material and criminal liability of politicians and about the return property declarations for the sum higher than twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">That to carry out it, it is necessary to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">At you as the president of such powers isn't present, and only the whole senate can offer laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as the citizen lobbied that carrying out excursions became free business, it managed to be advanced.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem consists in cheap politics - when someone comes with the good offer at the left or on the right, to it deliberately obstruct, and it constrains citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the independent non-party person I have much bigger potential for receiving support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage that I without party unfolding on shelves, without thinking about doctrines can take that is the best for our country from each party and to apply it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You consider yourselves as the person more relating to right or to left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view it seems to me that people carry me rather to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it isn't important - a little to the left or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me it is important that we went forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is a question not that someone belongs to right, and someone to left, I want to unite people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I will always support any good decision for society, whether will offer its KPChM or GDP, and I in the same way will be against bad idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You are angry when someone says that you the populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether but you prove it to what you told?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create the business plan for firm, you also have any ideal purposes and views.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you try to come nearer to it.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is possible to call it populism, but all offers about which I speak, already function in the world, or prominent experts speak about them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without parliament support you still have only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with it in policy you long don't hold on.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or you think, what when you will leave to people and talk to them, you will manage to realize criminal and a liability?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to win them over that we achieved the.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was elected the president, wouldn't make a problem to organize live television broadcast in which I will address to chairmen of parliamentary parties with an appeal to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they, in case of refusal, will have to report why it don't want.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there is a strong personality who will sound abuses, it will be possible to put pressure upon a political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take direct presidential elections are there was pressure merit from the public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I say directly that I am a fan, instead of the genius and not the intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to look for allies to defend the belief and views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I only a beginner in policy, and for the program will try to get majority support.</seg>
<seg id="50">I put I try to advance independently; in case it doesn't work well, in six years I will finish and I will return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It partly sounds as if Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I any not savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one I will make nothing therefore I bypassed a number of known people with the offer to stand for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused in connection with large volume of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also I at least supported the journalist conducting investigation to Jan Lorentsov who opened fraud with light fuel oil products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I proposed himself as a candidate because people indeed aren't satisfied, but now I feel on scales.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of people didn't go on elections, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">Us independent in the Senate only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">People chose the Senate so that changes will be carried out hardly.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite it, I will fight for the views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You think of the basis of own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I didn't think of it yet because I have no time for checking purity of the last each potential supporter, and I have on it no money.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money and for presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You speak about property declarations and how your own affairs with it are?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The personal property is estimated approximately at 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have a site in Prague worth about 25 million, the apartment on 10 million, one more apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art approximately on 10 million, Aston Martin on 3,5 million and Shkoda Superb on one million, well and some more millions on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way Aston Martin at me appeared because it there was my boyish dream - I always liked Jaymz Bond who went by the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You go by Aston-Martin, you own property on 60 million and you have no money for campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but own money especially in it you don't want to invest.</seg>
<seg id="71">It isn't so convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15 million on campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I have to get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">In campaign I enclosed already 2,5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">That fact that I have no sponsors, testifies that my program isn't so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to pay for election campaign from the pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">Expenses on campaign to me in fact will be covered by a senatorial salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But on this money I wouldn't live, for example, couldn't pay to the son for English school which costs 30 thousand monthly.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to earn only money, so anywhere wouldn't stand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Means, further you will carry on business that it was possible to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Unless you didn't say, what reduce this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it doesn't depend on the salary size.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I also promised, I partially reduced the activity.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, my deputy becomes the managing director of travel agency in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like that I was the disinterested person who will store the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I too need to live on something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How many how the businessman, you got used to receive monthly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From two hundred to four hundred thousand that I receive further.</seg>
<seg id="89">And if I became a president, the business would finish.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Architects of MVRDV prove that the real adventures happen not only in imagination - on the example of Speykenisse and his recently constructed Book mountain - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"This building seems to me cheerful, it looks futuristichno, at last at us again it is possible to see something interesting", - speaks to Lizetta Verkhayg, prokhozhy on the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stephane Spermon, the information technology specialist at the large enterprise located nearby, considers so: "No, this building is really beautiful".</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder: why to us today one more library?</seg>
<seg id="5">All have Internet, iPad and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Already anybody voluntary doesn't go to such old-fashioned libraries, truly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Speykenisse, to the low-remarkable sleeping small town near Rotterdam, belongs an unusual record.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its population numbering 80.000 people has the lowest education level in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">For fight against this annoying circumstance it was a few years ago decided to make a contribution to the general education and to construct seven invented bridges which are represented on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures from reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then fathers of the city understood that they still had only opportunity to overcome statistics: to construct here library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame Maas from Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, the master of courageous column charts and the author witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, treated a task with the usual coolness and appeared on competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin on a face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while judges perplexedly looked back and shrugged shoulders, impudent Maas put from the original gift a piramidka by the size and finished speech in protection of the project by the following words: "Dear citizens!"</seg>
<seg id="14">Here it, my offer: "The book mountain" in Speykenisse, so-called Bukenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later this mountain worth 30 million euros grew.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of the project of a revitalization which includes also underground garage, a supermarket, mail and houses some adjoining to them and townhouses in total on 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November "The book mountain" was noted by the second award of competition "The Best Library of the Netherlands of 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">Also the project participates in national Dutch competition of wooden constructions of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, the faceless suburb which couldn't offer before anything, except a post-modernist foot zone and surprisingly ugly town hall which white facades suggest an idea of milk plant, became richer on one modern work of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the most important - in Speykenisse appeared the public building of cultural appointment first in the history of this small town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Long road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: book El Dorado under a cap for cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Here only one elevator passing in the center of a massif, after all the real admirers of architecture and reading will prefer to investigate this district on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">The room glazed from all directions - light and easily foreseeable, floors from the burned brick and elegant streetlights unmistakably create feeling of a public city square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is recreated ideally.</seg>
<seg id="26">The look involuntarily looks for benches, dogs and boys playing soccer and little girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere - books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Usually book shelves stand along facades, and in the middle the big dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless" settles down, - speaks Blame Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We put a classical configuration of space upside down and pulled out a zone for reading from within outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center offices, Internet library, chess club, the ecological center and technical rooms settle down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Especially please black book shelves which serve that as finishing of walls, parapets, a ladder handrail.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their look, texture and smell are unusual.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even experienced architects and civil engineers guess that it for an unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We sought to work with secondary materials", - Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing a community of Speykenisse, according to standard requirements explains.</seg>
<seg id="35">And somehow time at one agrarian enterprise in Frislandy we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Already there are a lot of years in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots the artificial fibrous material of millimetric thickness is applied.</seg>
<seg id="37">It cheaply and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textiles serve one-two season after that it can be thrown out.</seg>
<seg id="39">For library this cloth - in such volumes - was pressed for the first time in the panel four centimeters thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of heat and pressure so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, strong material, on a smell a little reminding new car and is a little sneaker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">On top conduct 105 steps.</seg>
<seg id="42">The one who will overcome a way nearly 500 meters long, will be rewarded in literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquets and wood ficuses in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care of the atmosphere, and first of all of the correct humidity of air on the literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Costs of new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"It is difficult to believe, but this building, despite a set of glass surfaces, represents the model project in respect of ecology", - tells Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">For its heating and cooling warmth of the earth is used.</seg>
<seg id="47">Though the Book mountain costs under a glass cap, even in clear days the sun gets inside only for a while.</seg>
<seg id="48">Wide farms from the glued wood, located perpendicular to a glass facade, give a shadow and assume the most part of sunshine.</seg>
<seg id="49">Climate indoors the very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">Other protection is provided by completely automatic rolled curtains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stephane Spermon mentioned above the skeptic from the sphere of IT, already visited new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">To Lizetta Verkhayg also already I was here.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard who called Bukenberg "Speykenisse's soul which didn't suffice long ago".</seg>
<seg id="54">Reason: some weeks prior to opening each inhabitant received the invitation to offer one book from own meeting.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books had to take blank spaces on shelves yet not fully completed library - at that time in it there were 70.000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">Regiments are crammed up to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse, than the thin library", - speaks the architect Blame Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our invitation now each inhabitant is to some extent connected with this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that its book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it serves only for ornament.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV was succeeded to solve a royal problem which on a professional slang is called identity creation.</seg>
<seg id="63">Speykenisse wrote the literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And let they are very young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It after all only the initial point for creation of identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sabot: "Germans have to play more important role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany refrained from voting about recognition of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stefen Sabo, the communications expert between the USA and Europe, arriving so, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of a week Germany at first let know that it will vote against the demand of Palestinians for receiving the status of the observer at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin refrained from voting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stefen Sabo: Germany doesn't support action of Israelis in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany needs to be careful in connection with its special relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I consider that it also doesn't support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to show the independence - thus without acting is too critical in relation to Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During revolt in Libya in March, 2011 Germany also refrained from voting about introduction of a prohibited zone for flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result of NATO carried out this offer.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult to Germany to take an accurate position on difficult international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it so.</seg>
<seg id="15">The matter is that it is in process of transformation of the foreign policy, namely passes from policy which, so to speak, the USA, to actually German foreign policy operated.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition the situation becomes complicated that Europeans have no coordinated uniform policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, Germans again appear between two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">From them it is expected that they will play more independent role, but they didn't get used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I consider that while they only grope the role, but are on a way to "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">To such foreign policy what is carried out by France or Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What the "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view specifically means?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is readiness to take a position which isn't depending on a position of the USA or the European partners in the national interests.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is on export and communications with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic interests of Germany substantially differ from interests of other large states and therefore Germany has to protect the interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Whether these economic interests affected a position in the Middle Eastern conflict and on vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore she needs to show care not to offend the public and elite in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case it plays the role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I wouldn't attach it too great value, it not completely unilateral communication.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case it plays an important role in calculations of Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether Germany to the relations with the USA did much harm, abstaining at adoption of important decisions, such as vote about Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in Europe and even in the USA the understanding of the German position prevails.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore I don't think that it was the same dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.</seg>
<seg id="34">Probably, Germany even will get thus a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all it signals that it should be perceived seriously as the player on the international scene and that it is necessary to reckon with its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The USA, on the contrary, accurately supported the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether there is a divergence of opinions between the USA and many European states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Owing to the American domestic policy such distinctions existed always.</seg>
<seg id="40">I consider that Obama's government at heart has sufficient understanding of the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with a local political situation the government, of course, can't openly take such position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that essential a confrontation of opinion aren't so considerable at all, as always it is represented.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama Netanyahu not so delighted with policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Whether easy Germany to combine the close connections with Israel and the USA on the one hand and position of the major partner in EU with another?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think, it does a situation such difficult for Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Certainly, to Germans it would be slightly simpler if there was a uniform, consistent European policy, but now it not so.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore they can't act within broader approach and are compelled to work instead, relying only on own vision of a situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">Exactly so they arrive with euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future Germany will assume the leading role in development of the common European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that for Germany it is difficult, at least because of communications with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This subject always was ticklish.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think, to Germans is clear that they have to play more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany itself sees itself as the important international player - whether it on herself will take really leading role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or the leading role still hard is given to Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany didn't get used yet to it, still it is always unpleasant to it and, for the obvious reasons, still always hard is allowed to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Let's consider, for example, euro crisis - each time when Germany assumes an important role, the most various anti-German feelings are shown.</seg>
<seg id="57">It isn't simple to Germans to cope with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">Actually, it is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded with the hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view Germany is in much more difficult situation, than the USA.</seg>
<seg id="60">It has to take into account the most different neighbors and opinion, and it is difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, influence of the USA in the European policy constantly weakens, but at present EU doesn't fill this vacuum who then remains?</seg>
<seg id="62">Germans simply should play more significant role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if it isn't pleasant to you, unpleasantly or strengthens dislike for you - such is life!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stefen Sabo - the deputy director of Transatlantic academy in Washington, institute at which academicians and experts-political scientists from Europe and North America in common investigate problems of transatlantic community.</seg>
<seg id="65">Besides, the Sabot - the member of the German fund of Marshall in whom it specializes on the German policy, foreign policy of the USA and a transatlantic relationship.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani - a world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what such Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">This name absolutely officially registered in China which has nothing in common with firms from which names it is formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless it will be protected until owners of initial names won't make the claim.</seg>
<seg id="6">But also then it isn't clear, whether it will manage to them to defend the rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"To foreigners everything becomes more difficult to protect the trademarks in China", - Thomas Pattlokh, the lawyer of the Taylor Wessing company specializing on violations of the rights to trademarks in the Far East speaks.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my table every week appears on new business such.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It is enough to simulators to add only couple of letters to acquire the right to register the trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">So from Gucci Lu-Gucci turns out, instead of Prada it is possible to register Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">By the same way the German enterprises, for example the producer of sports goods of Puma are legally copied.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Pattlokh opens the folder with records of department of registration of trademarks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010 the Chinese company registered there Zegna DF Puma trademark, the artificial name in which the name of the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna is used also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That Chinese - world champions in copying and violation of intellectual property rights, is known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In big cities there are the multystoried department stores selling almost only fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">However I put Pattlokh not the such. At the request of the principals he acts against the Chinese enterprises absolutely officially acquired the right to use the name which is already protected somewhere else from department of registration of trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Chinese call it "a ban минпай", brand passenger.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word associates about "a ban дакуань".</seg>
<seg id="19">So call women who hunt for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities don't recognize fault</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It causes damage to business, it is necessary to fight against it", - Pattlokh is convinced.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The trademark is washed away, unique situation is lost, image very strongly suffers".</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural expenses in affected branches are estimated in millions, especially in case of expensive copied products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company on CLSA market researches, China with sales volume of 15 billion euro a year is the third by the size and the most quickly growing sales market of luxury goods.</seg>
<seg id="25">However difficultly to achieve removal of doubtful entries in the register of trademarks, and there is it expensively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Process can last till nine years, with not clear outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pattlokh tells about affairs in which the court rejected claims as after long time the protested name became "reality of the market".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If to the claimant doesn't carry, he even will have to pay to the plagiarist as caused damage to its trademark in China, Pattlokh speaks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes here corrects the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also well-known affairs on graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the Daimler company lost judicial dispute with the producer of construction Sany cars, the enterprise which shortly before that got manufacturing firm of Putzmeister concrete pumps.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore Chinese have still the right to use an emblem similar to a star of Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Geely company which has bought Volvo originally used the blue-white logo reminding BMW; process was successful, Geely was necessary to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The producer of fashionable goods of Lacoste lost in China to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore at which the well-known crocodile looked in other party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities don't consider themselves guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">Department of registration of the CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of shortage of the personnel and the equipment of rooms difficulties there took place.</seg>
<seg id="37">But last year there was "a return from an emergency situation in working process to norm".</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the number of the raw affairs on objections decreased by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nearly 57.000 such cases were closed, is 75 percent more, than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless 81.500 claims still wait for production in department.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To fight against it costs much</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As it is very frequent in China, figures impress.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year in CTMO more than 1,4 million statements for protection of trademarks arrived, honor one third more, than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is a record and means that China in the tenth time in a row headed the list of new registration around the world, reports department.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same concerns total of the valid trademarks, only 5,5 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 it was paid 1,8 billion yuans of collecting.</seg>
<seg id="47">If to simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuans or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is worth protesting it many times more as shows business of the German family business Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">On an extent more than seven years the concern fights against the Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Germans managed to achieve that illegal production of counterfeit automobile details by it was liquidated.</seg>
<seg id="51">However the simulator secured the Chinese rights to Freudenberg trademark.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was own omission as surnames in Germany aren't subject to protection, Hanno Venttsler, the chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich speaks.</seg>
<seg id="53">And department of registration of trademarks of CTMO rejected a claim of Munichites.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, in both following instances of Freudenberg won, but the adverse party continues fight still.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It is necessary to be on the alert</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the question is under consideration in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Venttsler hopes to bring the matter to good end and praises professionalism of vessels.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also speaks: "Process is extremely expensive and takes away from us a lot of time, money and nerves".</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal expenses hardly give in to the account, the archive of firm had to see even acts of centenary prescription to provide proofs.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago Freudenberg without results offered an adverse party "the large six-place sum in euro" for settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"From here it is clear as it is expensive to us costs", - Venttsler speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Dangers of the Far East threaten to be thrown even to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Namely in case simulators register there for themselves unprotected trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and products from skin.</seg>
<seg id="65">The concern stopped long ago production in these areas, but despite it could prevent registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"It is necessary to be on the alert", - Venttsler speaks.</seg>
<seg id="67">As it, and the lawyer Pattlokh recommend to the German enterprises to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It isn't enough to rely on world situations about protection of trademarks, rather foreigners are followed "by everything that somehow it is worth protecting, registering also in China", - Venttsler speaks.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can manage much more expensively, than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Really: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the trademark, will have to pay to an adverse party license charges for own name, Venttsler explains.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise us will force out from the market in a disputable segment.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to an assessment of Unaids, the United Nations program on fight against AIDS, in the world about 34 million HIV-infected are.</seg>
<seg id="13">23,5 million from them live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland lives 245 000 orphans of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus more than 40 percent of the population of HIV-are positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni's village the association Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 from them attend the school preparing for further training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros a month it is possible to assume patronage.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees to the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot dinner in the Gogo-center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Имбонги in the Zulu language the story-teller or the eulogist means.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this hall don't speak fluently on a bow, but are able to sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nearly ten years chorus study songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even brings them again there where they appeared for the first time: to the south Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all at distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Haydelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village of Esitzheni which depends on voices of the German chorus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There live about 2000 people some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among inhabitants there are a lot of children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them remained without parents who died of virus ICh.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitzheni in a miniature the illness of all Swaziland is reflected: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest in the world expected life expectancy according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trimming of an extreme flesh at men which is proved reduces risk of infection half, among the population it isn't accepted almost.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry in themselves an immunodeficiency virus, death on the middle of the fourth ten - not a rarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The chorus opened this village on a joint trip across Africa in the spring of 2005, but before Imbogni's participants saw a great number of children on streets to which didn't suffice not only parental care, but also it is simple in total food, clothes, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without school education the person in the poor country has in general no chances.</seg>
<seg id="32">At first it was the private obligation of certain participants - for some euro a year to send the child to school and to give the chance it of once a day to receive hot food.</seg>
<seg id="33">But already a year later chorus I based the association "Voices for Africa" which almost professionally cares since then of orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The facts about infections, sexually transmitted</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What major diseases, sexually transmitted?</seg>
<seg id="36">To bacterial STD carry syphilis, clamidiosis and a gonorrhea (gonorrhea).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent virus STD are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">The pubic pediculosis and itch belong to parasitic STD.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What main struck groups?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea meet generally at men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">Robert Koch institute recognizes that a minimum in four of each five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transfer results from sexual contacts between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">At heterosexual adults often meeting diseases, sexually transmitted, hlamidiyny infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are.</seg>
<seg id="43">HIV distribution among heterosexual adults at us rather low - however about 20 percent of new infections of HIV is the share of this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among youth hlamidiyny infections meet significantly more often than among other groups of the population.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the European data, three quarters of all infections strike young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">At us among youth human papilloma virus also often meets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How the quantity of cases of infection changes?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all diseases, sexually transmitted, are subject to obligatory registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">Incidence of syphilis, according to data of Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The quantity of new infections of HIV since 2007 decreases.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">It approximately on the one tenth is less, than in previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">At infectious diseases there can be ulcers in genitals, complaints at an urination, allocations, pains in the bottom of a stomach, and also bubbles or consolidations.</seg>
<seg id="55">However often they aren't accompanied by pains and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How it is possible to be protected?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms are capable to reduce risk of infection, but don't give absolute protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">After all partially causative agents of diseases, sexually transmitted, can extend also by a contact infection and at close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore experts recommend regular inspection, especially at frequent change of sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">At early diagnostics it is possible to cure the majority of STD and to avoid the remote consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Patronage, donations and not least the fees for performances of chorus across all Germany allow to collect something.</seg>
<seg id="62">"All we sent to Esitzheni already about 200 000 euros", speaks to Anneta Lennartts, the chairman of association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village from Germany Tsodva Dlamini, the conscious and active woman disposes of money.</seg>
<seg id="64">She cares also of that orphans were well arranged, for example at one of grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Гогос as call on Zulu old women, it is a village support.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them accepted to themselves to 14 orphans, give them a roof over the head and care of that children in shape every day in time appeared at lessons.</seg>
<seg id="67">At whom didn't remain native, arrive in a shelter to Haniysilya, the lonely woman who is getting paid from association, as well as two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Besides, the association "Voices for Africa" organized sewing school, constructed two hen houses and together with the American organization on health protection of PSI organized analysis delivery on HIV for many inhabitants of the village.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is difficult to present, but about an illness which is so obvious in all country, prefer to be silent deeply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo", - speaks to Anneta Lennartts, - "because it is connected with sexuality".</seg>
<seg id="72">Quite unusually for the country in which the king officially has 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III, is known for the love to excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, on such lifestyle authorized by the state the fault that virus ICh so quickly extended in last years also lies.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it lies also on vagrant workers who carry a virus about the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms are literally at every turn, speaks to Anneta Lennartts, "but them almost don't use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Other culture - a flesh to a flesh".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">A little to support a cultural exchange, Ibmogni's chorus each two-three years makes a trip on the South of Africa and sings the songs full of grief, fighting spirit, confidence and black consciousness which many on South country of the black continent know since an apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus full white, which is sung by songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and pleasure, but even, sometimes, caused tears in the face of severe frontier guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The trip always brings also into Esitzheni where singers visit sponsored children.</seg>
<seg id="82">In spite of the fact that the small village hardly can be found on the card, in a valley of the river of Etsulveni it more than is known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go to Esitzheni, there light", - local people speak.</seg>
<seg id="84">And after 8733-kilometer flight back in Haydelberg when stamping singers come back to a rehearsal hall on Bergkhaymer Street, it is possible to see that this light burns as well here.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Space department of the USA of NASA proved ice existence on a planet Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Though it is located most closer to the Sun, there also there is a frozen water as appears from three researches published on Thursday in the special magazine Science.</seg>
<seg id="6">The probe "Messenger" found proofs of that region of a planet constantly being in a shadow is covered with ice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its thickness has to make at least 30 centimeters, and it is possible, even to 20 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Allegedly, water occurs from a comet or, probably, an asteroid, faced Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nobody connects ice opening with life existence on a planet, the research supervisor of a probe Sean Solomon told.</seg>
<seg id="10">Temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="11">However these opening could help to explain how water and other construction elements of life got to other places of Solar system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Imperceptibly for inhabitants of Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example "Phoenix", investigate Universe depths.</seg>
<seg id="13">From time to time they send to image Earth: small windows in infinite distances.</seg>
<seg id="14">The image arrives from the camera which was developed by the German researchers from Max Planck's Institute.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Depending on a color rendition pictures of spiral galaxies turn into the real works of art.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The picture published by the European Southern observatory shows removed on some thousands light years a fog Trifid in constellation of the Sagittarius.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name Trifid occurs from the Latin word trifidus (three-submultiple, three-separate) as dark strips of a dust divide the heated heart of a cradle of stars into three parts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Zmeenosts's constellation astronomers photographed a harbinger of space collision: at distance of 400 million light years from Earth of a kernel of two merging galaxies rush towards will each other and inevitably face.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Telescope "Hubble" removed this birth of a star in a spiral galaxy of M83.</seg>
<seg id="38">The one who doesn't like technical reductions, can call it by the nickname "Southern Lantern Wheel".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The photo of a space telescope "Hubble" shows a fog fragment the Iris in Tsefey's constellation.</seg>
<seg id="40">The fog removed for 1400 light years, consists of the dust particles which sizes are from ten to hundred times less, than at a usual house dust.</seg>

<seg id="46">The star cradle constantly creates new stars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">This star cloud connected to a fog the Socket, also constantly creates new stars - at distance of 5000 light years from Earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In this brightly being shone galaxy with a small black hole still there is no dust, only gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">Researchers assume that it arose shortly before the Big Bang when in the Universe generally there was a hydrogen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our views in the Universe: the major telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Possibly, the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey - still before Galileo Galilei started one year supervision over stars later.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then mirrors of optical telescopes became more increasing - and spaces available to their look everything are deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Within 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope to "Plaited white bread" in observatory Palomar under San Diego was the biggest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror represented here, had diameter of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the USA, "The big binocular telescope" is established.</seg>
<seg id="56">He allows to look in space by means of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8,4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"Gran Teleskopio Kanarias" has the huge internal device - diameter of one only mirrors makes 10,4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of "A big South African telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless in the diameter it reaches about eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">Lack of an inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened under a vertical corner is limits its mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope of "Hobbi-Eberli" in Texas also has the fixed vertical corner.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its feature: high svetosobirayushchy ability.</seg>
<seg id="63">It reaches - despite rather small diameter of a mirror - parameters of the largest world telescopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">By means of a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">Participating in the Search of Extraterrestrial Reason project (SETI), any owner of the computer can help, having provided the computing capacity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">View of observatory of the European astronomical service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is "Very big telescope" - completely corresponding to the name.</seg>
<seg id="69">Its four mirrors allow to shine in a telescope even an average infrared range.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">In the Chilean observatory of ESO installation European "Very big telescope" also is planned.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror has to be stretched on the whole 42 meters - and will be made of nearly 1000 mirror elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">However photos should be expected not earlier than 2018.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Till 2007 both telescopes "Kek" on Maun Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the world's largest.</seg>
<seg id="74">In them two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters are established.</seg>
<seg id="75">Telescopes "Kek" are a part of observatory of Mauna Kea which along with them looks in the sky also by means of "Subaru" and IRTTF telescopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Besides, to Mauna Kea there has to be a new huge telescope - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here they can admire illustrations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However the most important views from space are delivered by a space telescope "Hubble".</seg>
<seg id="79">Since April 24, 1990 it delivers pictures of the far worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March, 2009 a space telescope "Kepler" looks for planets outside Solar system - first of all such on which life is possible.</seg>
<seg id="81">On February 2, 2011 NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets were revealed since the mission beginning.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the photo the last preparations of a space telescope "Kepler" are imprinted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">James Uebba's space telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 onboard the Arian 5 rocket.</seg>
<seg id="84">The main mirror of an infrared space telescope has diameter of 6,5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of problems of a telescope: it has to all over the world the first stars and galaxies to look for the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that on the South Pole of Mercury there is an ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However authentic data on it aren't present as "Messenger" rotates closer to the North Pole planets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements for decades specified that on Mercury there is an ice.</seg>
<seg id="89">Thanks to the probe started in 2004 "Messenger" - to the first which rotates round Mercury - scientists are sure now of it.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Through Talyshsky mountains it is possible to call a trip wild and romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The minibus with rumble slides on the twisting road by the hills which have grown with the dense woods, rough small rivers and simple country houses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything around is so green and is bright that it is possible to think as if you are in Schwarzwald.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But it is the most South country of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is in only several kilometers from here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here live талыши - one of the people of the Caucasus of which it is known a little, unless only that they perfectly speak on the farce and azerbayzhdansky and differ longevity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Terminal point is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small town is proud of too heavy architecture of Soviet period which isn't in harmony at all with a picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe don't come almost here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 323 kilometers eight hours as the road has only one strip leave.</seg>
<seg id="17">The legendary wealth by which the country is obliged to oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, didn't reach yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However Pilata Fatulayev (48) is convinced that to eat than interest tourists in Lerika.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In May of Baku became famous for a song festival the Eurovision - and next year at us the festival of the oldest people of the world" will take place, - Fatulayeva speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">She is a director of a museum of longevity probably the only thing in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here the biography about eight dozens talyshy of these places, which is documented more than 100 years. Fatulayeva points to the black-and-white photo.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grandfather, to him here 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the age of 136 years he gave birth to one more child</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But a disputable star of a museum is shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov to whom 168 years were allegedly executed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Birth certificates, however, aren't present.</seg>
<seg id="26">And taking into account that to the oldest person, whose age is documented, 122 years were executed, Myuslyumov's age is represented extremely doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973", - Fatulayeva explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years at him the daughter allegedly was born.</seg>
<seg id="29">Whether shepherd Myuslyumov so added couple of tens years to the age?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After all even Rembrandt Sholts, the researcher of age from Max Planck's Institute in Rostock, heard about long-livers in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Amazingly many people of old age can be met also in some regions of China, in Japan or in Hunz's valley in Pakistan", - Sholts speaks, "on Sardinia also there live very many very old people".</seg>
<seg id="32">However due to the lack of documents scientific confirmation of age is impossible as there were no registers of a civil status.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day glass of drawn butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless there is a fact that people around Lerik amazingly often reach bible age.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now here lives 20 people 100 years are more senior.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why here, in the south, there are a lot of long-livers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Azerbaijani guide Fareed Mugimzada explains it with special genes talyshy.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director of a museum Fatulayev, on the contrary, believes that matter in a food.</seg>
<seg id="39">Talysha love meat, bread and most of all dairy products much of them drink on a glass of drawn butter every day. However it is unlikely such high-calorific diet can be healthy from the diyetologichesky point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or matter in a primitive way of life which keeps to people youth? In Chengemiran, the tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzoev.</seg>
<seg id="41">In 97 years it is still relatively young for these widths.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in the simple wooden house typical for all Caucasian region.</seg>
<seg id="43">She sits on a floor with an oil barrel which tirelessly rolls there-here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Here under one roof there live eight people, including one of sons and Mirzayeva's daughter who already have long ago grandsons.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also nearby two kids skip.</seg>
<seg id="46">In kitchen for guests prepare tea which give in typical big-bellied glasses армуду.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Mirzayeva has ideally equal and strong white teeth, under a head scarf she hides long chestnut-colored braids which her son with pride opens before us.</seg>
<seg id="48">I always wash hair with milk so they never dropped out and kept color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"And I never used shampoo", - Mirzayeva speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The monthly pension suffices on life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She always ate only that grew in own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">For all life I never bought products in shop.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then she tells about the husband who served in army.</seg>
<seg id="54">It was heaviest after World War II.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it became better when "the beloved father" Heydar Aliyev got up at a wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Promotion not often sounds in speech of the old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However the cult created round a figure of the father of the nation which ruled the country as the dictator, in Azerbaijan practically knows no limit.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">The word "human right" is absent in the constitution</seg>

<seg id="3">Competing demonstrations in Cairo testify to deep split of the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">Future constitution based on Sharia, met furious repulse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian president didn't stint pathos.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have to create transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before god", - he told on the state television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was turned to all people, but first of all to Christian Copts, the liberals, the educated Muslims and not religious Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">After all all of them who still have been hopelessly separated in confused opposition, feel fear.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fear before the religious state on Nile on favor of powerful "Muslim Brotherhood".</seg>
<seg id="11">Mohamed Morsi, without apologizing almost, I told that he temporarily cut off competence of the constitutional court and expanded the competence, "to rescue revolution".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However that actually the 61-year-old engineer having degree of the doctor of the American university of South California wants to rescue, isn't quite clear to Egyptians and the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Whether judicial authority will be deprived of force?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Actually 234 articles managed to be dragged in a night 15-hour gallop with obstacles in Islamic adjusted constitutional meeting from 100 participants, and it partially causes fears.</seg>
<seg id="15">As well as in the previous constitutions, in the project it is said that legal proceedings rely on "the principles of the Islamic right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But what means "principles"?</seg>
<seg id="17">It was and remains interpretation business, and it is possible to be afraid that Islamists will use the indistinct formulation and arising in connection with it legal люфт for more strict interpretation of Sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least, one newly introduced article hints at it: in all affairs concerning Sharia, it is necessary to attract for council university Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic establishment of the country having big authority on all Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">It shouldn't, but can mean that the clergy supervises behind the legislation that de facto would have a consequence restriction of judicial authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the draft of the constitution a lot of things are an interpretation subject</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">One more problem: jurisdiction of civilians to military court has to remain.</seg>
<seg id="22">These courts in the period of the power of Mubarak served for suppression of oppositionists.</seg>
<seg id="23">After overthrow of the dictator in the military conclusion were to 11.000 civilians.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also, as it is told in the project, the state has to protect "true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to support its morals and values".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Legally it is formulated so indistinctly that public institutions by means of this article will be able to supervise even the maintenance of cinema and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">In clear it means no other than censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In general any article doesn't establish directly equality of men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">But another forbids to offend and discredit prophet Mohammed and his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">But that such insult and as it has to be punished, remains not clear.</seg>
<seg id="30">Doubtful the formulation that "the insult of people" is forbidden also is submitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether will be caricatures on the president or jokes about the jurist enough?</seg>
<seg id="32">The interpretation question, as well as a lot of things, according to him, will be presented soon" in this project which Murcia offers for the signature and which to Egyptians on a referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Revolution returned"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Some weeks the opposition against a superiority of Islamists is formed.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity in the evening of Friday on Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy this document still before it will be able to come into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Revolution returned, and we will win", - Hamdin Sabbakhi who has taken the third place on presidential election told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel prize winner of the world and the former head of the international department on atomic energy Mohammed El-Baradei declared that to the draft of the constitution a place "on an ash heap of history".</seg>
<seg id="38">Through service of short news of Twitter he accused adherents of Murcia of desire to head "putsch against democracy".</seg>
<seg id="39">"If he declares a referendum, we will go to its palace and we will send it", - oppositionist Yasser Said told.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="55">He was beaten, sentenced, arrested for it.</seg>
<seg id="56">And now the words "human rights" never meet in the new constitution, he regrets in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".</seg>
<seg id="57">Expansion of influence of Murcia on all three branches of the power disappoints the lawyer in the state.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures represent obvious blows to democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to new dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto cancelled it", - Sayeda regrets.</seg>
<seg id="60">After all without civil public organizations the democracy can't function.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Sayeda feels that all left it, even the international community which looks at ideological fight of the directions on Nile with a curiosity and tension mix.</seg>

<seg id="1">Norwegian ракфиск: the smelling fish most badly in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">At the five-million population of Norway one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also around the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Probably, the secret of success of this country is somehow connected with local addiction to one extremely fetid fish dish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take some become overripe pieces of cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place them in a lot of dirty and sweaty sportswear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave them there on a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">At you the smell striking sense of smell ракфиска - one of the best-known Norwegian delicacies will turn out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in a small town under the name Fagernes, in three hours' journey from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">Around the picturesque types covered with snow. It is very beautiful, but in air the ineradicable characteristic smell is poured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is the trout salted and roaming in water about one year, depending on what musty smell need to achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As twilight is condensed and becomes cold, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes, devoted to this most, we will tell so, to a fascinating dish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"It eat crude and wash down with a shot glass аквавита, local caraway vodka", - Havard Halvarsen, the local firefighter by profession and in combination "the rakfiskovy general" who directs carrying out a festival explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Everywhere round us people eat the fish cut by small cubes and wash down her with considerable portions of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"It is pleasant to someone аквавит, than ракфиск more", - Havard speaks.</seg>
<seg id="15">This drink is capable to interrupt a smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I try couple of slices.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it is possible to carry by a piece near by, everything isn't so bad - a little than differs from a portion of a land which you long carried with yourselves in the bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the Norwegian product from absolutely other times, poverty times when, even before emergence of refrigerators, fish in the fall presoaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salty water.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then in the deep winter when fish already well and thoroughly began to ferment, her took and, having muffled perception alcohol, used in food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">For memories of last generation that fact that thousands Norwegians were compelled to leave the country in job searches and to emigrate, mainly, to the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Now the population promptly grows - more than 13% are made by immigrants who are attracted here by workplaces, high salaries and the developed system of social security.</seg>
<seg id="22">Inhabitants of Sweden (the old rival, and not very long ago and much more prosperous neighbor) in large quantities come here to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is perceived as a certain important symbol, indispensable, though a little fetid element of the past of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This one of the most expensive local dishes.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, here everything is expensive - the small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost to you 9 pounds sterling (14 US dollars).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway seldom appears in world news, and the majority of inhabitants of the country, seemingly, suits it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">People here still reluctantly mention Anders Breyvik's name, the racist and the extremist of the right sense, last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Without mentioning his name, act of terrorism call "happened on July 22".</seg>
<seg id="29">It is very difficult to Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of similar atrocities and murders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the heart of today's wellbeing of Norway growth (since the beginning of the seventieth) one of the largest oil and gas branches in the world lies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"However oil - not the only reason of our prosperity", - speaks Anna, our waitress carrying trays with sustained rakfisky, the woman with a long fair hair and amazingly blue eyes, an embodiment of Nordic wellbeing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We such people - as you call it - judicious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As well as the majority of Norwegians, she perfectly speaks English.</seg>
<seg id="34">We don't like to be exposed on display, we aren't boastful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway very carefully addresses with the oil - the most part of the income of oil and gas branch is invested in the special fund created for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the years preceding the world financial crisis when all squandered money which at them wasn't, Norway it is economical I counted all expenses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"While it is possible to ski in the winter and to go hiking in the summer, it is enough of it for happiness", - Anna speaks.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Also is ракфиск", - she adds with carefree laughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in snow in a queue for any food - ракфиска I have had enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Here the hamburger with losiny meat is exactly exotic, tasty juicy meat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening we wait still bigger quantity of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.</seg>
<seg id="42">In my hotel carry out the special dinner devoted ракфиск during which visitors determine by vote the best or, probably, the most fragrant fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a direct air in which show the leader in a tie butterfly, surrounded with plates with the rakfisky.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is similar to the song competition "Eurovision".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"So, the Torahs Juergen, what assessment you put for the best fish there at yourselves in mountains?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Yes, Havard, here our assessment"....</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">All laugh and applaud.</seg>
<seg id="48">Someone falls from a chair, probably, having touched аквавита.</seg>
<seg id="49">Or perhaps having simply inhaled a smell of this fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hard beginning of the career is necessary to the president of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto is going to enter a position, the correspondent of BBC Will Grant invites us to look at difficulties which it should face, and on the mixed expectations of the population of its country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Traffic in Mexico City now in especially deplorable condition.</seg>
<seg id="4">This city is overloaded with transport and in the best time, and since Monday the steel obstacles which cutting some key highways to the capital and have caused chaos on roads were erected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However it was made not not to allow people to reach for work from suburbs and to prevent participants of protests to get to the parliament building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Sunday the new head of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto will put on a presidential sling and will accept reins of government the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is faced by a difficult task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico achieved good economic indicators at Felipe Calderon's administration which now puts the powers, however the country wallowed in war with drugs which in six years already carried away about 60.000 lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government declares to the people of Mexico the readiness to struggle with violence", - Mr. Penya Nyeto told earlier this week to the U.S. President Barack Obama in an oval office of the White house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I am going to offer new strategy of safety which will allow us to reach this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To such statements near the U.S. President political career of Mr. Penya Nyeto developed on a post of the governor of his native state of Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="12">On its homeland, in the densely populated and extensive staff surrounding the capital of the country, opinions on the new head were shared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Rectilinear person</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the idyllic small town of Valye-de-Bravo, for example, it remember with warmth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Inhabitants put it down to credit tourism revival, development of the resort sphere and infrastructure creation.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is possible to reach the city on one of the new highways constructed by g-ohm of Penya Nyeto which strikingly differ from roads with hollows and holes which were earlier on this place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plates with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum devoted to climatic changes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We pin on it hopes of real and serious changes", - the friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the congressman of staff from institutional and revolutionary party (PRI) led by Penya Nyeto tells it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We expect the real and resolute changes which are so sharply necessary for our country, first of all in the field of safety and economic development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 year of continuous stay in power the PRI party was forced out in 2000 by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Olvera recognizes that after him 12 summer absence in the presidential palace Los-Pinos the party lays hopes on Enrique Penya Nyeto.</seg>
<seg id="22">Besides, it disproves charges of triviality which were brought to the new president by opposition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It is very rectilinear and very devoted to business of an embodiment of the vision of the future of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is the excellent statesman, and, first of all, the person, able to listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But in other part of staff many people had other idea of the former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The municipality of Nesaualkoyotl known also under the name of Syyudad-Nes, is the most striking contrast with paved streets of Valye-de-Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under platforms of highways, it in many meanings is the suburb of the Mexico City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And problems in municipality too have severe character of this megalopolis.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier this year for suppression of the gangs trading in drugs in these areas, armies were attracted; and the violence concerning women has here especially acuity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On the waste ground near an extensive dump only some tens bodies of the killed women in the last two years were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than one thousand women was killed in the state of Mexico City during a governorship of Mr. Penya Nyeto is considerably exceeds a similar indicator in the city of Ciudad Juárez which has sadly become famous for violence which name became nominal when speech comes about murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">According to opponents of Mr. Penya Nyeto, about him at the best it is possible to tell that during the stay on a post of the governor he didn't manage to cope with a problem of murder of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the worst case its administration accuse of full ignoring of this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The inhabitant of the concrete house similar to the majority of houses in this decayed area, Irinei Buendy hardly constrains tears, showing me photos of the late daughter Mariana Luna.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version Mariana in 2010 committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">However her family considers that it was killed by her roommate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I reached her house, was it seems that her body before it washed up", - Mrs. Buendiya remembers.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs of that it was beaten, and the body already stiffened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Mariana's mother retells this history, and the portrait of the daughter looks at us from a wall where it hangs near a crucifixion on which only one word is traced: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">It, according to them, it was refused to this family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Officials of staff treated me as with the old gossip dissatisfied with the violator of tranquillity.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want that people simply took trust everything that they speak, and kept mum.</seg>
<seg id="43">But it is wrong, so it is impossible, in particular when around there are a lot of violations and defects", - she speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Having put on a presidential sling on Saturday, president Penya Nyeto together with it will assume hard responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">For the last six years tens of thousands of families in Mexico mentioned the crimes connected with violence, and the new president promised to make the solution of this problem priority during the board.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that he will be just the same president what was the governor", - Olvera, the congressman from Valye-de-Bravo from PRI party speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However the family of victims in Syyudad-Nes most of all are afraid of it.</seg>

<seg id="33">In April, 2011 Manning transferred to military prison in Fort-Livenvort, the State of Kansas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Besides, on Friday the judge asked Manning on the statement which it made during evidence on Thursday, that after once at night he forced to sleep naked in its camera in Kvantiko, it forced to face naked security guards and other prisoners on morning check.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning declared that had no opportunity to be covered with a blanket during check.</seg>
<seg id="36">Answering questions of the judge on Friday, Manning told that understood from the order of the security guard that has to throw a blanket with which it could be covered, but recognized that anybody directly didn't order it to throw it.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination - the story of the American of the Mexican origin.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans were compelled to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans are inclined to blame those who left because they remind inhabitants of the country of hard times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben Navaretta considers that Mexicans of the American origin are broken off between two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico City I passed along the corridor for arriving, came nearer to a zone of border control and froze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs indicated two turns: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I faced some seconds them, without knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew in the central California, and me all life called the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="9">This simply conditional name just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves as Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I stopped on a difficult design "the American of the Mexican origin".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need in conditional names or difficult designs.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish to ask rather well questions or to answer them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my lexicon is poorer, than at native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Therefore I got the American passport and became in turn for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered this history a few days ago when the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto visited the White house and met the president Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda there were habitual for meetings of presidents of these countries questions: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">President Penya Nyeto willingly spoke about lifting of the Mexican economy thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico instead of getting over to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to sign the contract on partnership with the USA and Canada and to create a certain North American trade block like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">Besides, president Penya Nyeto promised to continue war against narcocartels in Mexico, however any specific proposals didn't sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico the relations with the United States - the question heavy and executed of old offenses.</seg>
<seg id="23">The majority of Americans never reflected that in 1848 the United States intruded in Mexico and under a barrel of rifles compelled her leaders to refuse a half of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Mexicans think centuries, instead of minutes, and see reminders on those events in everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore any statesman of the USA needs to mention though the criticism word towards Mexico, in the press and among elite of the Mexican society complaints that Americans encroach on the sovereignty of neighbors are right there distributed.</seg>
<seg id="26">And Montezuma's descendants are filled with eagerness to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Thus the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of the Mexican origin, living in the USA are the most difficult.</seg>
<seg id="28">You want to talk about offenses?</seg>
<seg id="29">It is enough of them.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and lost, people who find in this country for itself opportunities, and for whom such opportunities aren't present.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio there are a lot of people of the Mexican origin only for one reason: at some instant their family history someone - the father or the grandfather - had no opportunity to realize itself in Mexico and was compelled to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most often it were Mexicans of a certain type - swarty, poorly educated, from poor country families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we remember it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico it see differently.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today our life is an embodiment of the American dream, we studied at good schools and got good job, but to us not to forget what even this dream - American, instead of Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination is confused and isn't clear, but we know, what country to consider as the.</seg>
<seg id="37">United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Besides we know that the majority of representatives of the Mexican elite and ruling class don't love us.</seg>
<seg id="39">We answer them with the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see in us a reminder on humiliating defeats and treat us as to people of the second grade, as to artificial Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We insufficiently well speak Spanish, and our communications with Mexico are insufficiently strong.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence for them is explained by failures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't leave.</seg>
<seg id="44">We wouldn't appear now behind a silk curtain, having found in the USA full life, but having lost spiritual touches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the USA in the childhood, and it reminds me that between the real Mexicans and Americans of the Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans understand the national identity more accurately, and it is offensive for Americans of the Mexican origin.</seg>
<seg id="46">She is the citizen of the USA and considers that belongs to both of these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time my many familiar Americans of the Mexican origin don't feel belonging to one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Receiving best of two worlds, you inevitably lose roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we are Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the USA us call Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I found out during the trip as though our relations without that are insufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and representatives of the intellectuals want to restore the relations with diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want that Americans of the Mexican origin worked as some kind of ambassadors of Mexico and presented its interests to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell to the American friends about what is the beautiful country and as it is healthy to visit it, and could convince political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Aha, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="56">It won't work.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is too much offenses in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And considering a gap between rich and poor, the corruption and drug traffic revelry, many of us at all don't consider this country such fine.</seg>
<seg id="59">Excuse, but deal with it, амигос.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And it is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If the part of Mexicans can't still forgive to the United States how they arrived with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they should take and that fact that some Americans of the Mexican origin still in offense for how quite recently in Mexico managed with their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps, we have more than general, than it seemed to me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old fights in the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Ceasefire Agreement between Israel and Hamas group can become the fragile base for the further world</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Whether the long-term world between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East is possible?</seg>
<seg id="4">The next round of bloodshed pushes to a conclusion about futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound, the become habitual, senseless disputes on the one who began the first; set of buildings are ruined; over 140 Palestinians the majority from which made civilians, and six Israelis are killed; for the first time during the conflict, let out from the territory of the Gaza Strip of the rocket fell in a neighborhood of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However in spite of the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly got stuck in the immemorial conflict, changes came to the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is possible to treat it differently, however events began to whirl "Arab spring" a set of the settled realities in a rebellious storm, and Palestinians with Israelis didn't manage to stand aside from the whirlwind which has shaken the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">It becomes possible, as a result, their fight of even more bloody than earlier.</seg>
<seg id="9">However there are the reasons, giving vent hope on from this deadly deadlock.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">War without winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first sight current situation doesn't give reasons for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if ceasefire, the agreement about which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, the collisions which have occurred on this week only strengthened positions of security officers from both parties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Leaders of the Islamic Hamas which has come to the power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will declare that they compelled Israel to recede, despite the losses suffered by them.</seg>
<seg id="14">In spite of the fact that some leaders of group were destroyed, and 1,7 million inhabitants are blocked in one of the most densely populated and problem corners of our planet, Israel didn't manage to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actually Hamas increases the popularity on the West Bank - one more Palestinian territory supervised now by more moderate movement of Fatah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, leaders of Hamas can quite come to a conclusion that time works for them.</seg>
<seg id="17">In process of growth of influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world Hamas has new influential and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reviving regional leader Turkey which once was the closest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, acted with Hamas support; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Triumphing supporters of Hamas declare creation round Israel of an Islamic half moon - from Lebanon in the north in which the militarized Hezbollah group, to Syria in which more and more pro-Islamic insurgents it is just about overthrown Bashar Assad's power, and further to Jordan where the authorities of the king threaten allies of Hamas governs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most considerable change of balance of forces in the region happened on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt where at president Mohammed Mursi movement influence the Muslim Brotherhood became stronger.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak who ruled Egypt within 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was the secular dictator who wasn't paying special attention to support of Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, is the organization in many respects similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic arrangements of Hamas can become the significant player, whose voice won't manage to be muffled even to Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time supporters of the "rigid" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military sense of Hamas it was prostrate.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli antimissile system "Iron Dome" justified costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the rockets started Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="27">Citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least any time.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the USA remained are true the invariable position; many European countries also laid blame for the beginning of a final round of violence on Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">One more important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, in particular at the government of Benjamin Netanyahu who substantially ignored peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">In spite of the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis were lost from the rockets released from the territory of the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize a problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of a wall which comes on the territory of the West Bank - considerable part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements which continue to extend despite illegality of such actions from the point of view of the international legislation.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of prime minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - within preparation for the elections planned for January 22 - united with even more aggressively adjusted conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What sense to indulge Palestinians and to give them own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If to give in their charge all power in the territory of the West bank, whether they from there will start starting rockets towards Israel how it is done by their colleagues in the Gaza Strip?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to hold them behind a wall and rigidly to suppress any attempts to raise the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Probably, supporters of the "rigid" line will win a victory; however their calculations can be disproved in the Arab spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Thus that Islamists who come to the power in Egypt and other countries, have not the most warm feelings to Israel, internal problems become their priority task.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defensive part of the budget of Israel is more, than at all his Arab neighbors, together taken.</seg>
<seg id="38">The initiation of war with a regional superstate hardly will help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Murcia which together with Barack Obama worked over ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark itself the beginning of changes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel, in not smaller degree, has to consider long-term consequences of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="41">In process of approach of democratic changes in the Arab countries, deprivation of Palestinians of the right to self-determination represents a time bomb which will blow up sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus which has been blown up in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repressions already undermine bases of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - growth of the Arab population - only aggravates these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">For bloody operations which are performed everyone some years in the territory of the Gaza Strip for Hamas suppression, it is necessary to pay in growing discontent of the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both parties need an external impulse</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">There is the only decision for which sane representatives from both parties, and also the most part of other world and our newspaper continued call: formation of two states and a concession Israel of territories in exchange for safety.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is a hope, not too impressive in short-term prospect, - hope that ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the conflict parties more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt long ago it is time to them to make the decision to block arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and also Turkey and Qatar have, more than ever, advantageous position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state accepted since 1967 taking into account an exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other Arab countries also have to make efforts reconciliation of movements of Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would make more for creation of the Palestinian state, than the forthcoming vote in the UN recognition of virtual statehood of Palestine can become which result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The role in setting Israel for a negotiating table, has to play and the president Obama.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the first term it didn't submit own plan of peaceful settlement.</seg>
<seg id="52">After return to the White house it still shows unwillingness to be connected to the solution of this problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is catastrophically short-sighted position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States are vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is possible only in case of the peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Australia the law on the unified packing for cigarettes came into force.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Preventions of harm of smoking and the image of the parts of a body struck with diseases contrastly are allocated on the sad green boxes identical to all brands of cigarettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Australian law first in world practice on the same packing of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color registration of different brands by an identical box of sad and olive color with terrible pictures of the parts of a body struck with an illness and images of children which health is undermined by smoking of their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Besides different pictures and the inscriptions warning about harm of smoking, the only difference between the packs, entered without fail since this Saturday - name of brands which are printed with an identical small print.</seg>
<seg id="5">These are the most severe in the world of a condition for registration of packings of tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this measure - to hold youth from smoking, depriving this addiction of the fashionable status.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a basis of such decision results of the researches which have shown laid down that the people, not started to smoke till 26 years, in 99 cases from 100 so never and don't become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"It is obvious, what even at the most early age children understand sense which the tobacco companies by means of packing registration" try to inform, - Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek explains, referring to the researches which have shown that, for example, the crown in a logo associates at children with idea of the princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the share of smokers smallest in the world so these changes won't especially affect profit of multinational corporations, however possibility of acceptance of similar measures is considered already also by other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Representatives of the tobacco industry strenuously counteracted adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tobacco companies claim that it only will increase a share of the black market in which cheap and available cigarettes will be on sale.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This law will lead to serious consequences, other than what reflected his initiators", - Scott Makintayr, the representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia considers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Producers of counterfeit production from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone, on the contrary, new laws promote business growth.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha from the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that demand for cigarette cases and the silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on packing, promptly grew (practically from scratch) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in high court of Australia where tried to appeal against this law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Sandra Ha, the Zico company already realized about six thousand products to the enterprises of wholesale trade and expects new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us it is good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Potential hindrance for efficiency of similar measures is, according to experts, popularity of social networks among that part of the population on which these measures are directed.</seg>
<seg id="19">After acceptance in Australia of a number of the laws which have made illegal TV advertizing of cigarettes and support by them of sporting events, and also forbidding to sellers to expose cigarettes in a visible place, advertizing of tobacco products moved to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The government of Australia forbade the local companies and websites to place advertizing in a network, but it can't limit in it foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you trade in tobacco products and you still had only this small opening, idea to advance the goods on the Internet will seem to you the extremely tempting", - Beki Friman, investigating questions of public health at University of Sydney explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman notes growth of number of reviews of the trademarks, the ordinary users written from the face allegedly, on such social networks, as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a question - whether this work of the ordinary citizen who so loves Marlboro cigarettes what didn't regret forces and time is valid and made the video, or behind it there is an advertizing company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Australian office of the British American Tobacco company claims that in branch now are more occupied with adaptation to new rules, than advertizing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures, as sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and Dominican Republic for contest of new rules: these states make a complaint within the World Trade Organization, declaring to that trade underwent unfair to restrictions in spite of the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision of the WTO is expected to the middle of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Thani Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries possibility of adoption by them of similar laws on packing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001 Canada the first entered obligatory placement of the photos warning about harm of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now this rule is accepted in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">Possibility of toughening of laws is considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Great number of smokers in Australia defiantly don't obey innovations.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures don't touch me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I simply don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Simply you snatch out a cigarette and you hide a pack in a pocket", - Victor El Heyg buying cigarettes with the photo of a tumor of a mouth on a pack explains.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly speaking, the only thing that can force me to throw is my small daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu managing shop of the tobacco products King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that identical packing complicated a problem of arrangement of goods of regiments</seg>
<seg id="37">"Earlier at me on unloading of new party hour, and now four hours left", - he complains.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government should take and absolutely to forbid a cigarette, we then would tell: what to do, all right, everything is over, we close shop", - he speaks, throwing up hands up.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">To miss in the world of electronic networks and continuous connections it isn't so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">I unexpectedly had to spend five hours to this Thanksgiving Day at the airport because mechanical malfunctions were found in our plane and it replaced with other plane of which we and waited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, I had enough time for reflections about the boredom nature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I won't deceive you.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the afternoon at the airport waiting for flight it is really boring, and here not strongly will help neither books, nor magazines, iPhone, even duty free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However recently more and more scientists and specialists in children's development express in favor of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss not so badly.</seg>
<seg id="8">It compels a brain to distract for interesting adjacent subjects that, probably, promotes creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And as all of us constantly are in the modern world in front of any screen, advantages of boredom pass by us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We need to strive for boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time isn't present.</seg>
<seg id="13">We still will return to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Earlier I, as well as many, considered that boredom - the invention of rather recent times when people had more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">It not so, is approved by Peter Tui, the professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University Calgary, the author of the book "Fascinating History of Boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Actually the boredom can brag of very ancient history", - he speaks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On walls in Pompeii Latin inscriptions about the boredom, dated are found the first eyelid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Thus there is open a question of how we understand boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem in that, says John D. Eastwood, the associate professor of University York in Ontario, Canada that the understanding and boredom vision often changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Having studied materials of researches on this subject and having asked a question to target group in 100 people, professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: the boredom is when people "want, but can't be engaged in that would bring them satisfaction".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Difference between boredom and apathy, he speaks, is that the missing person doesn't do something that would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">At apathy of it doesn't want to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The basic in endured boredom, he says, it "violation of attention and the moods connected about it deterioration and feeling of that time hangs heavy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">According to the description the boredom can seem very similar to a depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However professor Eastwood claims that despite possible communication between these conditions, missing people see the reasons of problems in world around and circumstances, and the people enduring a depression, see problems in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems to us that it is boring for us when actually it is simply difficult to us to concentrate on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the research "Unoccupied reason: boredom definition from the point of view of attention", published in September issue of the Perspectives on Psychological Science magazine, professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the experiment made earlier which participants listened to record of the voice reading the magazine.</seg>

<seg id="28">One participants heard also loud sounds of the irrelevant TV program included in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds on low the loudness so they could be sorted, and the third group listened only to record of a voice without a foreign sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard the TV with low level of loudness, noted that it was boring for them, is more often than others - it was difficult to them to concentrate, but they didn't know the reason of it and attributed it to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to concentrate attention on a difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, Mark Dzh speaks. Fensk, the associate professor of neurology at Gvelf's University, Ontario, and one of authors of this research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, peering at a stream of products on the conveyor in search of the marriage, distracting music can help to avoid boredom".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is considered, it continues that when people start rocking on a chair or to draw a scribble on a sheet of paper, they do it with boredom, however now we know that actually such actions simply help not to relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Research showed that children to whom don't forbid to fidget and spin, study better and more information, than children from whom demand to sit quietly" remember, - the professor Fensk claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">At any moments all of us test boredom: at a flight delay (as in my case), listening to monotonous speech, looking through the uninteresting movie.</seg>
<seg id="35">However different people show different degree of tendency to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980th years researchers developed for measurement of such specific features special "a scale of tendency to boredom".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">For assessment definition on such scale questions and statements, for example, "A lot of things from this are used that I should do, monotonously and monotonously" or "Too a lot of things are interesting to me therefore on anything there is no time".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Researchers defined by such questionnaires that boys miss more often than girls, - Stephen Vodanovich, the professor of psychology at University of the Western Florida, - in particular in the presence of various external irritants speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However as a whole teenagers in general often miss.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991 Read Larsson, the professor of personal and social development at University of Illinois, made experiment during which it contacted the help of a pager almost with 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He received the following results: 32% of teenagers declared that is boring for them at school and during homework performance, and 23% declared that is boring for them outside school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thus only 3% of parents noted that it is boring for them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larsson notes that he has no data on what would be similar data on boredom now, a 21 year later.</seg>
<seg id="44">However he knows that "it is the share of teenage age peak of tendency to boredom", generally because to children and teenagers don't allow to solve fully, than to be engaged in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Let's return to my initial question: the boredom is useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations it as show researches, can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risk gamblings or abuse of certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers reflected on communication between boredom and creativity, professor Vodanovich who has devoted to studying of this problem more than two decades speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"So our brain prompts to us that it is necessary to be engaged in something another; it also is boredom", - tells Gary Marcus, the professor of psychology at the New York university.</seg>
<seg id="49">However this brain not always knows in what exactly it is better to be engaged.</seg>
<seg id="50">If it is boring for you and you will direct this energy on game on a guitar or culinary experiences, you will make to yourselves better.</seg>
<seg id="51">However if you begin to watch TV, to you it becomes better only for some time, and it will pass soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Therefore if your child misses and you give him iPad, it will cease to miss, however he won't learn to struggle with boredom independently or somehow otherwise to operate the time and employment, - the professor Fensk speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"And such skills of independent regulation are involved in the most different situations", - he claims.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only to occupy independently himself with something, he also studies self-checking in general.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that the boredom needs to be extolled somehow.</seg>
<seg id="56">However to consider it as something bad too isn't necessary.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is necessary to learn to feel comfortably even out of a continuous stream of actions and technologies rather.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"We see it so that we need to test more often boredom, thus that the boredom is the extremely unpleasant, unsatiable desire to be engaged in something intelligent", - he speaks.</seg>
<seg id="60">Actually people seek to be disconnected somehow from constant cares and it is simple to relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In the modern world we got used to continuous excessive stimulation of sense organs, - he speaks, - and when there comes silence, we are lost and we don't know that to do".</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">While it is unclear as the new law on marihuana legalization in the State of Colorado will be applied</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orosko, the nineteen-year-old player of a soccer team and the student of public college in the southeast of the State of Colorado is accused of commission of the criminal offense, being that will be absolutely lawful in all territory of the state soon: storage of a small portion of marihuana and tube in which he smoked it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orosko says that once in September he with friends was in Lamar and went in the car on the prairie near border with Kansas when they were stopped by police officers.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officer found marihuana in the car, to Mr. Orosko the summons for storage of drugs and knowledge of the adaptation for the use of drugs - small offenses came, the penalty is due for each of which of 100 dollars - and date of a court session is appointed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"With us treat as criminals", - Mr. Orosko speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Whether but criminal it?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of uncertainty which proceeds some weeks after the State of Colorado voted for legalization of the use of marihuana in small amounts for entertainment, the solution of hundreds small lawsuits depends not so much on the law, how many on a consideration place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Charges of the small offenses connected with marihuana, already are removed in hundred cases here and in the State of Washington which took a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations already stopped bringing charges to aged people of 21 years and are more senior for storage of small doses that will begin to be considered lawful as soon as in few weeks the law will come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However in more conservative districts of Colorado accusers made the decision to consider the existing cases connected with marihuana, and still make responsible for storage of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time in some cities from suburbs of Denver to mountain regions of the West vote to allowing emergence in their places of the new shops licensed by staff on marihuana sale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All this develops so promptly that I at all don't know that to wait further", - Deniyel Dzh speaks. Оутс, the chief of police in the small town the Aurora in the east from Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Representatives of supervisory authorities in the State of Washington too it is puzzled scratch the heads.</seg>
<seg id="14">They should create rules for definition of an order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and marihuana sale, and all this needs to be made till December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, it is good or it is bad, advances the majority of other states in settlement of use of marihuana, at first in the medical purposes, and now for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In Colorado more ordered market therefore they will serve as a good example", - Brian I. Smith, the representative of Council for regulation of production and sale of alcoholic products in the State of Washington explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now nobody can make more, Mr. Smith recognizes, than to put forward any offers and to hope that it will work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent by which we could be guided", - he speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The bill of the State of Washington called I-502, will come into force on December 6 and for the whole year will cast staff into a condition of uncertainty when the system of the state licensing still isn't present, and the right of possession of marihuana is already legalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there are after all still difficult technical aspects which need to be solved during this period, for example, how to find balance between the staff order about "adequate access" to the licensed marihuana with a ban on trade in it at distance of 1000 foots from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It will be especially difficult to place the licensed enterprises for trade in marihuana within the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs", - Ben Livingston, the representative of recently created research group "Center of Legalization of Marihuana" explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21 the chief of police of Outs from the Aurora dispatched to the subordinates by e-mail the message that the prosecutor's office of the city won't attract any more the persons which have reached age 21 year, to responsibility for possession of a small amount of marihuana and that the police stops convicting people of these violations "from this time".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The chief of police of Outs reported that the police will watch observance in the city of the rules regulating activity of persons, growing up marihuana in the medical purposes, and will pursue illegal dealers and distributors of drugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The prosecutor of the district Ueld in the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, represents more strict approach to this question.</seg>
<seg id="25">After vote under the bill he declared that the prosecutor's office still will make responsible for possession of marihuana, mainly to induce using her faces to receive medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At present accusations of storage of two and less ounces of marihuana though many of them are accused and of other violations are brought to 119 persons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"An obligation of our institution - to pursue for actions which are considered criminal at the time of their commission", - the Mr. Tank in the statement told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Reaction was ambiguous even in such places, as Mes's rural district where participants of vote rejected the offer on marihuana legalization.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police Grandee Dzhankshn, the largest city in the district, any more doesn't make responsible full age for possession of a small amount of drug.</seg>
<seg id="30">District attorney Pete Hauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss charges on already open affairs connected with storage of marihuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I consider that to provide law observance until it won't change - our direct duty", - he speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In spite of the fact that 55% of inhabitants of the State of Colorado which have taken part in vote, supported this decision, inclusion of questions of use of marihuana for entertainments in the state and legal system won't be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">And inconsistent reaction of inhabitants in different places of staff bared ambiguity of the relation of local authorities to staff experiment with marihuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"District attorneys in this question have a cultural barrier", - Sean Makalister, the Denver lawyer representing interests of condemned for storage of marihuana, and the local representative of the National organization of reforming of laws on marihuana explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They so long pursued people for it that now can't reconcile to that it any more a crime", - is told by him really.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington - to the first states in which a small amount of marihuana treat the same as to alcohol - is fated to become an experimental field in country scales for check of the idea of legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Supporters of legalization and officials of staff plan to broaden the territory of the legalized trade, but at the same time they cautiously wait for instructions from federal the authorities which still plan to consider sale and marihuana cultivation as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Supporters of legalization of marihuana hope that the Justice department will concede in this question.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite the arrests which have slightly received a broad resonance of dealers and the patients using marihuana on medical indications, the federal government in most cases authorized trade in marihuana in the medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Fight agents of Bureau with drugs will rush hardly into houses to confiscate a small bag of marihuana, however they hardly will begin to close eyes on regulated by the staff authorities shops of recreational marihuana which are resolved under the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, the former adviser for questions of fight against drugs in Obama's administration considers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some cities in Colorado didn't begin to wait actions of the federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To presidential election some local administrations approved the moratorium on opening of new shops on marihuana sale which and so couldn't open earlier, than in a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week Montrose, the city in the western part of staff, nominated a six-months ban on trade in marihuana which, most likely, will be approved next week to consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to appear in such situation that we will grant to someone the license, and then it will cause serious problems at federal level", - Bob Nicholson, the member of city council speaks.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now the contradiction is available at us between results of local vote and subjects, for what staff voted.</seg>
<seg id="47">There are more many unresolved questions.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Petronella Uayett: me survived from Oxford that I am a conservative.</seg>
<seg id="2">Prosecutions of students of universities for their views began not today.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">How many I remember myself, I always dreamed to arrive in the Oxford university.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mine the father and the big brother studied in Oxford and described it as the educational institution best in the world, the modern analog of an antique symposium putting two bases of a civilization - free-thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And still, two weeks of study later on department of history of Worcester college of the Oxford university in the late eighties, I collected suitcases and left that poured out in the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father didn't sustain and began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">Friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I threw college because it wasn't pleasant to me that my classmates have sex in the neighboring room.</seg>
<seg id="9">Writer E.Normann Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from chipped cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Actually everything wasn't so amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran away because me systematically poisoned and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">At all because of my quite unusual name or that I studied at private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">Me poisoned only for one reason, and in this glorified cradle of culture it looked the true barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, nowadays the late Woodrow Uayett, was known for adviser Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You ask, why to remember it now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the last data, the new generation of students adhering to right-centrist views, is exposed to the same persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred to conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week the group of such students demanded the same protection of the rights, as that which is provided to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservatives from student's club of the Christie's Case college in Cambridge declare that them "often actively isolate, subject to personal attacks and force to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to enter into committee on the equal rights of college of the additional representative to provide freedom of expression of the opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation was aggravated only by the documentary film which has left recently on BBC 2 about policy in the student's environment "A wonderland: young, clever and right" in which conservatives presented clowns and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the movie Joe Cook, the former president of Association of conservatives of the Oxford university who goes in Rolls-Royce was shown, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver knob.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities conservative students complain that of them do "whipping boys because of increase of a payment for study".</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke Blek, 20 years, the vice-president of Association of conservatives of Nottingham university, in interview of one of Sunday newspapers told that "in the university environment the distortion towards left-wing views increases.</seg>
<seg id="24">People who at all don't know us, consider us in advance as impudent and with impunity violent children of rich parents".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Semyuel Roberts, 21 year, the student of department of history of the Christie's Case college in whom the application on protection strengthening was submitted, calls such atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of Association of conservatives of the Oxford university, says that the relation of members of student's club to carriers of right-centrist views considerably worsened.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It represents threat as for the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, and it is simple for normal life of clubmen", - she speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first some weeks in Oxford I was not simply in minority, I was one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I arrived there in September, 1986, the shy and timid eighteen-year-old girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford was in a fever with hatred to conservative party.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a year before the university vote deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher of her honourable degree because of reduction of budgetary appropriations on the higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even to Stalinists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week of the first-year student when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time that waited for me ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">I yet didn't know that teachers not only made light of persecution of conservative students, but also with pleasure took in it part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political affairs - a strike of miners, privatization and disagreement of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government - got into the Republic of South Africa through the walls of audiences sheathed by wooden panels.</seg>
<seg id="35">At my first seminar I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I wasn't ready to that followed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Ms. Uayett, - the teacher, nowadays the late Harry Pitt, - please told, translate the first paragraph".</seg>
<seg id="37">The text was given me hardly, I faltered.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was very choleric man with the person similar to a pie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Tetcherista essentially don't study French or simply brains don't suffice to them? " - he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students started giggling.</seg>
<seg id="41">At me tears in the eyes acted.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I advise to you to take some initial lessons of French in free time if you, of course, aren't so occupied, mixing in society", - Pitt grumbled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to the room of the absolutely unfortunate.</seg>
<seg id="44">That evening in college I sat at dinner one; then someone patted me shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, the second-year student from faculty of English which was presented as the member of Association of conservatives of university.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are, - he told friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> - Unfortunately, business is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">over everyone whom suspect of sympathies for conservatives, will scoff.</seg>
<seg id="49">To me it is hard, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher therefore to you it will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="50">The majority of conservative first-year students pretend to be that they are labourists".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to play the hypocrite.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that agrees not with everything that speaks to Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">Cunning wasn't successful.</seg>
<seg id="54">The first-year student of faculty of philosophy, policy and economy who itself studied in Eton, told: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.</seg>
<seg id="55">You infectious".</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students picked up his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was spoiled, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How conservatives have sex? - I asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> - They bang each other, the truth?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt as, has to be, homosexuals before cancellation of criminal prosecution in the sixties felt.</seg>
<seg id="61">Whether I will be able sometime to lead normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or I should meet adherents only under the screen of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">Whether I will be compelled to become a labourite and to hide the real belief?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years coming me began to seem a hell full of persecutions and loneliness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only teacher in my college, the conservative views, Norman Stone, the professor of modern history wasn't hiding.</seg>
<seg id="66">It hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also that he was an adviser Thatcher concerning foreign policy and one of her speech writers.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college it practically didn't appear.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised it for provinciality, meanness and commitment Marxist детерминистскому to a view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 it accepted a professorial position at university of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you won't be happy", - he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to go to Oxford from the parental house in London, trying to find a shelter among relatives and impartial capital friends.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told the father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.</seg>
<seg id="73">It didn't believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During its study in the forties any political views there were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But after all same the best university in the world, - was told by him plaintively.</seg>
<seg id="76"> - There of the such aren't capable, only not in the city of dozing spikes...</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends always behaved faultlessly".</seg>
<seg id="78">His damp eyes grew turbid.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Don't make hasty decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that it simply jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">You will hurt to me heart if you throw university".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was exhausted with constants to trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also the conservative, didn't sustain pressure and refused the belief.</seg>
<seg id="84">Next week during a seminar when the next teacher of history absolutely seriously called me "the enemy of the people", I decided to arrive as.</seg>
<seg id="85">In soul being burned with shame, I admitted that "I was raked over the coals by parents", and called them "old fools".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The respite was short.</seg>
<seg id="87">My father was fated to hammer the last nail into a cover of a coffin of my career in Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time he wrote every week on two columns for the editions belonging to Rupert Murdoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I didn't leave, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I didn't return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me the crybaby and a rag.</seg>
<seg id="94">But in eighteen years nobody has to become object of such rage and intimidations in educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">That is more sad that it was Oxford which not only let out fourteen prime ministers of the Tory, but also to this day is behind undeserved reputation of university at which appreciate equality and free-thinking.</seg>

<seg id="4">The designer recognized it during opening "Valentino: the master of sewing", a triumphal retrospective exhibition which unites more than 130 dresses of the haute couture created by his "house" over the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I adore this palace", - he speaks with the unique Italian accent.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The heaviest profession in the world: miners from Kavakh-Idzhen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros the Indonesian miners risk life and health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur on volcano top on cool stony tracks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their work - a hell, and others literally work in a hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them Anto Vidzhaya, one of 400 miners who earn on life by sulfur production in Kavakh-Idzhen's located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every day Anto goes down on the bottom of a crater where the sulphurous gas rising from depths of Earth, stiffens at contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Having broken away huge pieces of the sulfur which gross weight can reach 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets and bears them upward on the steep stony road.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the volcano top which height makes 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, however are required to emaciated loaders more than 40 minutes to rise at a snail's pace, hardly keeping balance and carefully groping the road not to stumble and to fall from break.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one wrong move can cost them life as it happened to one tourist from France which broke a few years ago from Kavakh-Idzhen's rocks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners from Kavakh-Idzhen earn 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulfur which extract</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Having appeared above, they force the way through between tourists who photograph them as though they were monkeys from circus and, wearily bearing heavy baskets, three kilometers to scales which the mining company arranged slightly above, at the height of 1.850 meters walk.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a question of PT Kandy of Ngrimbi, the enterprise which operates since 1960 this volcano and, better and not to tell, the workers to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells it for 10.000 rupees (83 eurocents) to petrochemical productions, after all this mineral is widespread in an everyday life and is used for production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for sugar bleaching.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As norm is carrying of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each trip", - explains us Anto who usually carries out three daily carryings.</seg>
<seg id="14">It spends three hours for each of them and at the end feels broken, however they allow it to save up 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though it seems a hardly anything for such inhuman effort, it is three times more than that it would earn in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The day payment to miners is very high by local standards where 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros) pay for gathering coffee a day and average monthly earnings is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)", - the loader who worked as the bricklayer at the tourist island of Bali earlier explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">There its salary made 75.000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the site wasn't such heavy, but Anto returned with the family to Banyyuvangi, small town near a volcano, for the weighty reason which in Indonesia is same shattering as sulfur: "I married the girl from Bali where one induist, and I brought her to Java that it accepted Islam".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has an asthma, he labors for breath, constantly coughs, and at him слезятся eyes because of toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the 27 years Anto spent three years, risking itself in Kavakh-Idzhen which sulfur already started affecting it despite existence of a mask and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has an asthma, he labors for breath, constantly coughs, and at it слезятся eyes because of toxic gases which are emitted by a volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is the price which he has to pay for achievement of the dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Two more years because I want to open shop will work or to study Spanish or French", - he promises in more than acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished by life, this pleasant and clever young man could be the tourist guide, the waiter or the porter in hotel, but instead it performs work of a mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur doesn't cease to follow at night when its characteristic yellow color turns in blue and shines among a gloom.</seg>
<seg id="25">Throwing down a challenge to shadows, Anto goes down in a crater, shining itself the road with the small lamp connected to its helmet which he bought on the money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters drag baskets with sulfur on the shoulders from a volcano bottom</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite high profits, the mining company didn't mechanize sulfur production for economy of expenses and doesn't provide any equipment to porters who work for the account and with such deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually, they don't receive even part from 30.000 rupees (2,5 euros) charge for photographing which, along with the entrance ticket for 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), security guards of this reserve raise from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work for cattle, instead of for people", - declares to Badrusin, the thickset porter of 42 years who spent three decades since left college on Kavakh-Idzhen.</seg>
<seg id="30">Capable to lift to 110 kilograms, he assures that will suffer work "so much, how many will be able" because money for education of the three children aged from 18 till 10 years is necessary to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I won't retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Though sulfur burns a throat and burns down eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense columns of a smoke leaving a volcano, they are so hardy that any doesn't complain of the serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their habitual trouble breathing, arthroses, knee pains and shoulder ulcers which were deformed under weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing with a basket on a back, Unaynik only can lift now 50 kilograms in the 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day it and his companions take out 15 tons of sulfur from a volcano which three trucks transport on a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming distance in 18 kilometers on a narrow track among thickets.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I won't retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life", - Unaynik declares, widely opening a mouth in which there is no several teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">From his five children, the senior, 30 years, too works with a sulfur carrier.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but poverty immortalizes from generation to generation one of the heaviest occupations in the world: in what human mules from Kavakh-Idzhen are engaged.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am a husband the patriot, you are my spouse the patriot, we will fulfill our civic duty and we will create life!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Can seem improbable that these lines are part of advertizing of mint flat cakes, however despite it - or probably thanks to it is this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">These phrases are part of a rap which uses local sayings it seems "Let's put бао (roll) in an oven" to laugh over birth rate level in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertizing agency which made this video, BBH, cherishes hope that by means of advertizing they will manage to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, speaks that wanted to use the music force that people fulfilled "the national duty".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This thing only for the Internet therefore we needed to make it cheerful and ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the main problem in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We the worst in the world on reproduction similar therefore we felt that is that subject which we have to mention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government tried to make a lot of things, for example to carry out start of a pheromone perfume or to organize parties of fast acquaintances (blitz appointments).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas, probably, were creative, but optional worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore we thought why us not to make the most creative thing from possible to solve this problem, namely to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1,2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who doesn't perceive it so thoughtlessly, so this government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It spends 1.300 US dollars a year for policy for enthusiasm of citizens on the birth of bigger number of children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The state package for married couples and parents provides to 15.000 dollars on the child, prolongs maternity leaves and provides tax privileges.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has low efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and hi-tech state city in South East Asia, also known for conservatism of the management and the strict public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Birth rate level in Singapore, according to its national administration on the population, is now at the level of 1,2 children on the woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was lower than 2 - that is known as replacement percent - in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why Singaporeans have no bigger number of children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Vey Min, the director of Office of policy of married couples and families of National administration of the population, says that the reason for that "the improved education" and "wider scale of career opportunities".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"It allowed people to have wider scale of options in that, as for the vital purposes and priorities, besides a wedding and family creation", - she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes of social norms promote growth of number of bachelors and postponement of marriages and the births of children therefore birth rate level in Singapore decreased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the immigration policy which is directed on sharp increase in immigration for opposition to population reduction, causes indignation among local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are websites where hardly hidden xenophobia concerning many new immigrants prospers, in particular Chinese whom criticize for maintenance of salaries at a low level and unwillingness to be integrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Immigration growth also is considered as one of the reasons of that last year the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result on elections since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After elections there was an attempt to solve a problem, by means of quotas and more heavy taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While falling of birth rate has known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, expenses on medicine and policy of immigration, the example of Singapore also starts having some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government makes efforts that so much small housing wasn't under construction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it started influencing real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The guide to city development passed to control of number of the small apartments known as "a shoe box" which can be built in certain districts of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments of 46 square meters very well are on sale.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote a single way of life and deprive of incentive of builders who want to build big family housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yu Put, the director general of house-building firm EL Developers, says that them "shoe boxes" are on sale much quicker, than more spacious copies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in that sense that such apartments are bought up for some days, even weeks, quicker, than apartments of the bigger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result of it our monetary receipts increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless, he recognizes that new norms give clearer reference points for builders to whom put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The too overstrained</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Though these new rules can be a step in the direction of increase in national birth rate, after conversation with Singaporeans who work in financial quarter of the center, apparently, that they won't have special effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very overstrained, housing expensive, also as well as education, and because of it many people postpone it", - the young manager speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have own money and time", - other young man of 20 years speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention the career, a stress and housing prices and education as the reasons which prevent them to bring children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So, as though the government tried to induce the citizens by the birth of children, in that, as for a child-bearing, the last word remains for Singaporeans.</seg>

<seg id="39">Key questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Maryelos Porras, the teacher of English and the expert by training and to training, considers that to direct children and teenagers, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks - to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet appeared as means for information search, but with the advent of these sites rules of the game" changed, - she notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras specifies that academician Mark Prenski, the master of pedagogics from Yale university and the author of work Digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms for an explanation of this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">Digital natives it they, children and youth who were born in an era of technologies.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are digital immigrants who should teach them while we still study", - she speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Explains that this subject is difficult, "because we ask to have them a certain criterion of that is possible or it is impossible to extend, publish or speak, aged, when the maturity doesn't suffice for this purpose".</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also that they were selective while it is most important to be for them popular to have thousands friends, without thinking of consequences", - she adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality children and teenagers, - to ask questions which force them to reflect.</seg>
<seg id="48">"To speak to them that they didn't do it, it is useless", - she adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Porras lists some options: there are things which you wouldn't tell to the stranger, so why you do it on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, it would be pleasant to you if published the photo you like that, what you published about the friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Whether you know, what others publish about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you sign photos from parties, whether you ask for a permission from other people to mark out them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more, whether all need to know, what you do at every moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">One more point is to let to them know that they have to behave online the same as do it an offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">Rules same.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Out of the Internet of people behaves yours faithfully, responsibility and other principles as has to be on social networks", - she claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Vigilance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardy, the university teacher, the professor of primary education and the consultant by training, explains need of that heads of families politicians of social networks honestly read.</seg>
<seg id="59">Understanding each of points, they have the good bases for conversations with children about preconditions of opening of the account on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, age and that it is authorized to extend or publish", - he speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Gaurdy, a key question - to remind children a lesson "don't speak with strangers".</seg>

<seg id="1">"South America has to study at Europe in a question of integration of nationality": Rafael Correa</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that creation of the general nationality is the purpose in which "South America, in this case and, has to study at Europe".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of the South American nations (Union of South American Nations), carried out in Lima, declared to the state television of Peru that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other collisions, "however now they nearly one fatherland".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It protected, in this context, the project of establishment of the South American nationality which is approved by the participating countries of the Union of South American Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to achieve free movement of citizens and workers over any South American country as it already happens to members of the Andean community, but still there are reactionary sectors which want to return us to the past", - he warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Ecuadorian president proved, besides, the supporter of renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition of decrease in influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and acceptances in attention of those who signed the Pact of San Jose about human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those who gives lectures, never assume any obligations, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, we sign everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is inexplicable that the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States", - he declared, hinting at the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa assured that isn't sorry about this decision because with it he didn't betray the principles, and observed the "deep values of democracy and human rights".</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that in due time "there were certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to the third country and process" won't be observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It scarified, besides, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for interrogation concerning an estimated crime on the sexual soil while "the Swedish legislation finds it possible to carry out it by means of a videoconference which could be made of embassy of Ecuador in London".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and intellectual health of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I didn't speak with it since it arrived to our embassy, but the ambassador to me told that it had a small pulmonary problem, anything serious", - the Ecuadorian head of state told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That really is, so it is danger of deterioration of its physical and intellectual health because of an imprisonment in small space without opportunity to do exercises on air.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It influences health of any person", - he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa specified that the solution of the problem of the shelter granted to Assange since June in Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of granting a guarantee of inviolability which will allow it to go to Ecuador, is in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and emphasized that there were negotiations in London about search of a solution of the problem of an imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We don't carry on negotiations on human rights, we in this case don't use this word, but there were continuous discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution of this problem is in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange, Baltasar Garson's lawyer, conducts a number of processes in various European instances", - he mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Also I expressed opinion that "if Great Britain will provide tomorrow an inviolability guarantee, it will end".</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden as it is allowed perfectly by its legislation and as it already did in other cases, interrogates señor Assange in embassy of Ecuador in London or will interrogate it on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be settled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa used a case to prove as the defender of freedom of press and emphasized that doesn't suffer "mediocrity, dishonesty and lie which distort freedom of expression".</seg>
<seg id="22">"The main enemies of freedom of press it is not spoiled villains politicians, and the bad journalists supporting a profit, blackmail and extortion", - he told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this aspect it remained happy that already these journalists, "neither bankers, nor the bourgeois countries predominant forces don't dominate in Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen revolution for development continuation in a right direction".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in the Union of South American Nations at least to the following elections, reasoning it that the organization "has to be firm and not suffer opportunism and support of revolutions behind a mask of legality" because actually "it destroyed legality of Paraguayan democracy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Ecuadorian president considered, besides, "absolutely reasonable" desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to carry on now negotiations with Nicaragua on sea borders between two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of justice of the Hague which appeared in favor of the Nicaraguan sea sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At present this decision isn't observed.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The conflicts are inevitable, but they have to be overcome by desire to go together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and to continue to move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also he stated hope of good completion of dispute on sea borders which conduct in the same court of Peru and Chile, and stated that "it is correct to address for Latin America in the international instances if two countries undertake to make the decision, whatever heavy it was".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Concerning opportunity to act as the candidate on the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to stand for the third term in a row, he specified that considers this opportunity "with big optimism and pleasure though it is sometimes quite heavy".</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa assured that if will lose on elections in February, 2013, will leave public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In the personal plan I was never interested in the power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be corrected only from the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement considered what exactly I guaranteed this probable victory so it is necessary to recognize this responsibility", - he told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In case of a victory it would become my deadline as the president, and then we leave public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This decision", - he confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Cuba.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">AIDS mortality today - result of late diagnostics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabricio was 21 years old when to it declared that its analysis on AIDS yielded positive result.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Me as if deafened", - he remembers that difficult, despite all step of the doctor, the moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man hid it from the family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having decided to cope with an illness independently, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And its efforts came true - he already celebrated the 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabricio - one of the "oldest" patients of HIV office of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital where he got in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He lives with the diagnosis "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) 22 years. In the early nineties it would be difficult to believe in it - too little then existed treatment options, too few knew about an illness, too took a jaundiced view of patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, even the director of clinic of the Mexican institute of social protection didn't want to say goodbye to it, "because it had a cut".</seg>
<seg id="9">Differently, in those days to have AIDS was a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive at this syndrome and to make it, without worsening quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, without knowing about the illness, still many people come when the virus already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 year later after emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first declared cases, "big achievement at present is that a survival of the patient who begins treatment in due time, and a survival of the general population in accuracy are identical", - the head of HIV office of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva specified, having referred to that this information is confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific edition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The infectiologist and the expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists came to a conclusion that AIDS isn't a sentence, however duration and quality of life depend on extent of defeat of the immune system which is available for patients at the beginning of diagnostics, with the best expected life expectancy at those who doesn't use drugs: up to 30 years with CD4 number 200, and to 50 years when it is reported about 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In other words, the aforesaid means that the one who receives the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years", - he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To estimate this progress, it is necessary to remember that life expectancy of Mexicans on the average makes today 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Though mortality considerably decreased in recent years, in case of Mexico, number of the people dying of AIDS, decreased with 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of YuNEYDS), that from the moment of emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in a national database died is also right also.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Halisko 255 people died in 2011, and 187 death by May of this year are already registered; nevertheless, it is claimed that there is a universal access to anti-retrovirus preparations since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why still there are lethal outcomes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - Personally it seems to me that a problem not in access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I imagine it, affairs in our hospital so are.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least the last 12 years we had no lack of medicines, a problem that patients come very late because don't know about the infected condition, that is, at late stages of a disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It provided shattering data: "Nine of ten patients come when already have any opportunistic infection; that it is necessary to make to have a greater impact on the general mortality, so it to carry out diagnostics at earlier stage and therefore it is necessary to provide tests for detection in mass scale, for all people who will ask it".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the offer experts and officials of the State Council in AIDS prevention in Halisko (COESIDA), and also patients, like Fabricio who addressed for check in the private laboratory, induced only that it was made by his friend and, despite the early age agree in opinion, it already was at a stage of AIDS and even had Kaposha's sarcoma, a cancer tumor which is one of widespread complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that will die, and want to know nothing.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Time all the same I will die, I will be better to be torn three times a week", - they speak. But not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I well eat, I do exercises, I take medicine.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, his parents only know that he has a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I lead normal life, as any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have many occupations, I travel, I conduct active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I care of myself and of other person", - listed Fabricio who agreed to share the private life with MILENIO JALISCO to move the statement of those who now, in a context of the World day of fight against AIDS, feels fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let will be checked if there was a risk of infection, let as soon as possible learn, whether are they HIV-positive, so better and if they already have a diagnosis, let learn that can live as any other person, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">This its message summarizes a fight subject against AIDS this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind a counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Abyss bikes between programs in the field of health care and the simple citizen, are believed by Ricardo Salazar, the journalist from Guadalajara who took up the issue, connected with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the places devoted to this task, "actually distribution of condoms increased, earlier to us gave one or two, now to us give packages one hundred, and it is very good, but it appears that there are those who now still has no access to a condom", - he told.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections there are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why they to you? " it is a popular question, with malice and condemnation, from social workers, school consultants, employees of drugstores and workers of health care which teenagers don't want to hear, the propagandist assured.</seg>
<seg id="39">I suggest to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only behind counters and that one hundred them was in machine guns in public toilets in places which are visited often by youth.</seg>
<seg id="40">It not dissoluteness encouragement.</seg>
<seg id="41">Speech doesn't go about beer and motel payment, governor Emilio Gonsalez when it asked answered, whether distribution of condoms is possible at his management.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It not sexuality, is best of all to make condoms available to those who already practises sexual activity", - he noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key data in Halisko</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) are registered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Staff takes the 4th place in a national rating in new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of infections belong to a sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% to a perinatal way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">By estimates, 50 thousand people can live with HIV as on one registered case is from 4 to 5 people who don't know about it.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Considering ratification of the decision by appeal court of the United States which cancels restructuring of a debt of the Vitro Group, reached by means of competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes fatal precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country which has problems with solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems that procedures in support of a survival of firms which are permitted by the Mexican laws, aren't valid in the country of strips and stars, in a contradiction with the international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the practical sphere, approval of the decision passed on June 15 by the judge Harlin Hale in court of bankruptcies of the northern District of Texas, leaves defenseless the Mexican firms in the face of possibility of seizure of their property on that party of Rio Grande.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However the resolution opens doors to the leading producer of glass in Mexico for the appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, bringing into the proof three discrepancies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">As the introduction while the judge of business notes that creditors have to be regulated by the Code of the USA about bankruptcy, the Appeal court of the fifth district located in New Orleans, says that the main trial concerns the competitive production considered in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point means cancellation of the international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of the enterprises of a transnational profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Actually, the Model law of the UN on international trade law unification was for this purpose created, defining as the arbitrator the American institute of the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the verdict establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production of debt which had Vitro branches before the parent company, wouldn't be reached the majority necessary for the adoption of restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by the Mexican laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">Actually, Vitro wasn't the first case when this scheme is accepted.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are half-dozens of examples among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts guaranteed Federal institute of competitive productions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Truly as well that subtracting voices of branches, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against it in vessels of the United States, namely stervyatniki funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, wouldn't reach the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Vote would be 45 percent against 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Appeal court lowers these data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a difficult situation against which that came up since 2008, mentioned by a serious economic crisis which overtook the United States, striking blows about the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile the family firm Gonsalez Sada will show the decision appeal in appeal court that vote reached its plenum, that is, five judges in view of the fact that three voted only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In case of failure the petition for the certificate which will demand process revision from court of the highest authority, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States will be shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Worst of all that the court rejected the document directed by the government of Mexico as amicus curiae ("the friend of court") in which process to which Vitro within the Law on competitive productions follows is described, signaling that it exempts itself(himself) from observance of the agreements signed by both countries to connect it with article 15 of the Law of the USA about bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Besides, it is noted that the country obeyed to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations on international trade, that is, to the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Inveterate basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was connected more than 60 years with these sports and, thanks to it, visited the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Very few people in Puerto Rico store in memory so many basketball stories, as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And after all before the cerebral hemorrhage chained it to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was shipped in sports within more than 60 years, as the player of small categories, the player of the Highest basketball league, the representative and the head of BSN with Cowboys of Bayamon and the president of Federation of basketball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I carried out many roles in basketball throughout the life, including a little at the same time as when I was the president of BSN, the director general of the National team and the president of federation in the nineties", - Reyes remembers during Primera Hora visit to it home to Bayamon where he lives with Isabel, the faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes doesn't exaggerate, doing this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">Walls of his house, almost everything decorated with photos and the memorable things collected for its long way, testify to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamon in heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the greatest emotions it stores what remember its way through Cowboys, since the middle of the 50th years as the player till 1982 when 15 years of its performance as a coagent or the agent of the contract were executed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"It were my best years which I enjoyed most of all because had opportunity to be part of eight championships of Cowboys since 1967, as the agent, a coagent or the head.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of pleasure, including five championships, passed from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, in a year of a debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since that moment and from now on "Kuko" Aurtis who was the great administrator" began to direct, - Reyes specified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Jean Bartov who went here and was at university of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I for you have very strong player, growth 6'7".</seg>
<seg id="16">"You want?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And it was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who Puerto Rico had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boards then I recommended the sniper Raimonda Gauss who obtained nationality and I became one of our best goal-scorers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that told that if Minsi brought a champion's title to Bayamon, the Gauss would help to win one more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">With Gauss I took pleasure in a champion's title of Cowboys, but already at distance because by 1988 already appeared the chief of federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">By then I preferred to enjoy its achievements and achievements of Minsi in a national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember how we won for the first time against the USA during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then the World Cup of 1990 in which we received the fourth place came and it there had to be a bronze if not that Canadian judge who forced us to change final game, told Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">That team from the World Cup of 1990 is the best national team what you ever saw?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It among the best as well as that that won against Dream Team on Olympic Games of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my darling was that that from Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991 when we won gold and broke the national team of the USA which was quite similar to that which won against us bronze in the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="27">In that team not only again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fiko Lopez and 'Pikulin' (Aurtis), but also young (Javier) 'Tonyito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quichotte' Morales who couldn't participate in the 90th year because of an injury of a knee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team which, probably, was not the best in the staff plan, but brought us a gold medal and big pleasure, there was team of the Olympic qualification tournament of 1995 in Neuken, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With role players like 'Kanito' Nyeves, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Hurruitner instead of players, temporarily detached for a disorder in the Pan-American championship Mar del Plata, we won gold contrary to all forecasts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without any doubts, it there was Pikulin Aurtis.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its indicators on the international tournaments impress.</seg>
<seg id="33">Anybody in Puerto Rico didn't dominate at this level as it was done by Pikulin.</seg>
<seg id="34">And it without his career in various leagues in which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto-Rican the head?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is very difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had very good young growth including of Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raimonda Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From young, I very much like Leo Arilla's work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you consider the main achievement in federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Participation in the most nice era of a national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early nineties in BSN was to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What did you need to make?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things which I wanted to realize, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, that boys from Ponce played only in the area and only against teams from other parts of the island in national play-off.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now children travel and play too much, and it is excessive.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I see fruits of obligatory certification and a course for managing directors, officials and judges.</seg>
<seg id="46">It gives me pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What you now do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen to music, I look musical videos of my era at YouTube, I enjoy the grandsons and occasionally I go on basketball matches.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, I enjoy society of my spouse, Isabel who always was with me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The course which investigates "Doomsday" begins</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week students investigate the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and bacteria and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In this semester when the professor of religion Stewart Sharma decided to give a course about a doomsday, he knew that had an irresistible bait: the end of "a long countdown" calendar of the Maya, on December 21 for which many people as grasped at the proof of that the doomsday approaches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Charm of concept had no that it expected in the next few months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, financial crisis which some call "dolgoarmageddony", and the growing conflict where will involve Israel, a place where Christian theorists of the end of times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I didn't realize that it will be the most apocalyptic semester from all", - told Charm this week to students of University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If to analyse that occurs in the world now as though we still had only 30 days, it was really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also you remember that bad it is good for at whom apocalyptic views.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he isn't the only professor who offers courses on "doomsday" in this semester, theoretically the last in the history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At Templsky university the associate professor of Barry Wacker gives the course "Mass Media, Culture and Doomsday".</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week students investigate apocalyptic subjects, such as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze why these ideas extend over time", - he told, and a way with which offer the hypothetical scenarios causing certain acts of the person.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the nuclear material falls into hands of terrorists, for example, war can burst.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month students analyzed movies on apocalyptic subjects and studied as they correspond to examples from real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell to students that probably probably plausibly and is impossible", - told Wacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of University of the State of Pennsylvania the professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, the associate professor of history of art and anthropology, united to give a course which "Doomsday" is called simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We don't add '2012' always to have opportunity to give a course once again in case the doomsday doesn't come", - Restall told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite "inevitable destruction", students have to study, prepare projects and pass total examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In Penn State total examination will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse that doesn't leave to students of other choice, except how to work "till that night in which allegedly there will come a doomsday", Restall told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Courses were quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Places ended in two hours", - Restall told about the course for students with a high GPA in which 35 students registered.</seg>
<seg id="21">We received messages by e-mail within many weeks before a semester from people who asked, whether there are still places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Students, in turn, assure that this course one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"I like to observe that people do to console itself", - told Brigid Robinson, the 23-year-old student of office of religion and sociology from Haddonfild, to New Jersey, to Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">And apocalyptic thoughtway, secular or religious, it only question of a consolation or its absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Vekesa, the 25-year-old student of office of psychology and nurse business, told that watched all apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I never heard about a course which would teach it", - it noticed.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is pleasant to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But any of the interrogated students - not to mention the professor - didn't tell that trusts in doomsday date on December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project mentioned a prophecy of the Maya, and in some way we discredited it", - told Juli Zeglen, the 21-year-old student of a last year at Templsky university from West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Maya never predicted a doomsday; it is simply key moment in a calendar, Restall told.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in the western culture which totals some centuries where people react to changes round themselves, predicting a doomsday.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet caused increase in this speculation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"In other places people don't think of it", - he told.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mainly in the English-speaking world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Doherty, the professor of religion of university of La-Sal who teaches courses on Philippines this year, quickly answered a question of, whether he knows about any course about "doomsday" there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Philippines don't take part in a doomsday", - it wrote, hinting at the order of higher instance.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the Father.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall paid attention that throughout long time was spoken about many days of the last court, and told that if will occur nothing on December 21, "people will start thinking at once of the following date" or to philosophize that on December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world will end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and teachers carelessly treat this date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some told that are going to go for "doomsday" parties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Perhaps, I will call someone from friends together to laugh", - I commented Samira Ford, the 20-year-old student of faculty of communication.</seg>
