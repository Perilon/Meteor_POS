<h1>
<seg id="1">The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders need to justify its policy in combating spin on the election.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in the centre of бреннана believe last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws, the registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has received a new dimension after elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, only one 2011 was 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of the presence of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyaut right on the day of the will of the voter registration and take away the right to vote of citizens with conviction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections of 2006, no US state does not oblige voters to present a photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana became the first state, which introduced such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in 2008, adopted in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">During the last two years, they initiated bills, forcing voters to present a photo ID, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, unlike the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity cards, as a health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., the 21 million people who have reached the required for voting age, do not have identity cards with a photograph, issued by the government body of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a document.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceed 100 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% African American, 15 percent of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18 percent of people older than 65 years and 20 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 years did not have the required ID cards with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students - voters who are believed to be voting for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use a photo ID, issued their school.</seg>
<seg id="26">But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs that voted mostly for Republicans, the use of the voting certificates issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, no state has not demanded evidence of U.S. citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Starting in 2011, more than a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures, apparently aimed to restrict the voting of immigrants from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, the laws uprazdnyajošiem registration of voters on election day in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction has not passed without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign has helped make the voter registration lists of about 10 million people.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall in the 17% of registering new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters, who voted early, were African Americans, although recent accounted for only 13 percent of the total number of voters in the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same thing happened and with people from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24 percent of citizens who voted early.</seg>
<seg id="41">Unlike the whites who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters to actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several projects of the laws was vetirovano governors Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most controversial laws was suspended by the intervention of the attorney general of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This has partly to limit the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring charge identity card with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules in effect, of course, will make the implementation of the right to vote in the elections of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them a clear direction to affect the outcome of the 2012 election in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report from the Center for бреннана from 2011 demonstrates that the United States, accepted these laws are necessary for 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In fact, the test on the dog gives sometimes erroneous results, lzhenegative and sometimes lzhepositive that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">The men, and so reluctant to undergoing clinical examination, there is what hesitate even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">To pass the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of the two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so it is difficult to interpret the data, and it is difficult to work out any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who were screened and those who have not passed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also showed that, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of occurrence of metastasis by 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Are African American men are also at increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key is making the right decisions, as soon as the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">The cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patients need to clarify the risk of cancer, offering him options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making choices, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men who have detected cancer, will undergo a course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will continue to offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we start treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly, we have to define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not pass the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to assess all the pros and cons of passing the test on the dog.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe, to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is believed that if all the people were nice and quite moving, 30% of RACO cases could be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">"if no one smoked, this figure rose to at least up to 50 percent," said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that 10 percent of the cases of cancer caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is linked with 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is a risk factor for many other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It causes enormous damage to the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," said Press Secretary Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging fact: ten years after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and ovarian cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," he added to the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The association also recommends that limit consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancer of the colon.</seg>
<seg id="41">Should also avoid meat products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Conservation of meat by smoked fish, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"the past can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explained in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">B vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists were studying the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But for the moment, the results of these studies is not a single.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, while another gave the opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not complete clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson details</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last summer a message that scientists may be able to detect the Higgs boson, caused a real boom - and not without reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, much.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model, our best, or, at least, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, "but that previously could not detect experimentally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physics aren't yet sure what it is exactly about bozone Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that it strongly resembles boson Higgs, predicted the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, is confirmed, although for the full confidence of some of the data still lacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Imagine all the same, that we are talking about bozone Higgs, because the chances of mistaken seem minimal, and see what it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this world of one law is inevitable, recalls that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no way around this rule, don't even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although the particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: Pauli exclusion principle, "which posits that the two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same" Elementary "is a" condition "is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Based on this, particle physics is divided into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermionami, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the other, scurrying around бозоны, stark Banda anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can be safe in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the website (by the way, is quite extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, these bosonы divided, in turn, into two groups: мезоны, about which we are here to say we won't, "particles and forces," which are the main force of nature, and that in some way relates boson Higgs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal bozone: photonu, or "particle of light," which is a "courier" electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge, is accelerating or change direction, it "violates" electromagnetic field in this particular place, about how the stone in the pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "violations" born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a photonom - and, therefore, one of the carriers "бозонов force."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same thing is happening with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that to this boson appeared to be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to his institute, the need to achieve a very, very high energies, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface of which could move only very large stone.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated in CERN's Large Hadron Collider, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with electromagnetic field is also to explain the correlation between the Higgs boson and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact, have mass, while others (like photon, by the way), it does not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what "can do" all of these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">In science, they are used to validate the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of their observations and forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, some of them ardently yearn to such a discrepancy was found, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for a "New Physics" and silence some holes model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, not offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the universe (ouch-ouch!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But so far at CERN such disparities have not found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The consequences of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.</seg>
<seg id="35">See: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could even guess what the revolution will bring their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They foresaw their applications in science, but not more than that.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, since the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960, was invented the laser, which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen as a "laboratory gadget."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine....</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And besides, the application may be for instruments, accompanying the study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same williard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small sensor light.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though it wasn't his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This is, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care is the best way to die... | "debt."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate will soon be resumed, but at this time is preparing a bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yet in this important area, much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the debt" attempted to look closer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in monteregi.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer, razrushavshii inside him, gave him a reprieve for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was given five years, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor-gadboua in beløy where arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"but it's always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet, and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at the table, on which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He bodritsya, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead it in the bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage in the face of normal death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"my biggest wish is that I was cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team found a cure for this sickness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"for the life teaches us that a man must urinate standing," said Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the runaway victor-gadboua.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regress to the condition of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"it all depends on the ability of a person" live with the decline, "he argues.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, in the opinion of many people involved in palliative care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who enroll in palliative shelter Victor-gadboua, all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts look to a maximum of three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ms., 89 years old, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has enabled me to know their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have a good children," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I don't want nothing more in life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask, relieving breathing.</seg>
<seg id="27">She's still waiting in the coming days, the last visit his son, recruited from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the runaway victor-gadboua with the help of a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with food.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is the palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can be done.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to make the death more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one seat in the institutions of palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">This very little, given that sooner or later, we are all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian мартель - one of the doctors shelter.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether it's the comfort of physical, emotional or soul.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Dying we agree to provide rotovye rinse of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks.</seg>
<seg id="36">We are no longer impose diabetics control blood sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is a part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night we brought beer, Mr. H., who died today at night.</seg>
<seg id="39">On the morning of his son swilled down a beer in the legs of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"we help families, as well as patients," said Natalie Savar, director of care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the runaway victor-gadboua may one day is not like the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to a 93-year old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, situated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovasij everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"in the last six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," said Dr. Christian мартель concerned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-gadboua, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is believed that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to care, which is available to ease the suffering of patients who had entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home or in the hospital or in the orphanage.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some institutions, such as the shelter Victor-gadboua and society of palliative care at home of Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">This is the big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in palliative care fear the adoption of the law, legalizingyuschego assisted death and assistance in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October circulates manifesto, signed by beacons in palliative care, Dr. balfur mount and Dr. Bernard lyapuant and verifying their disagreement with a similar initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr Christian мартель, Quebec's health-care system is effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care quality before they will be allowed to move to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the department of emergency, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to ease.</seg>
<seg id="52">I'm afraid that patients are willing to die just because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of the Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she replied that he regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the same time, she herself told me that my days are numbered!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. мартель believes that 90 percent of the patients who asked about death, thanking medical personnel, for what they have not fulfilled their request, after a team of palliative care eases their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However, it should be noted that palliative care is not omnipotent in dealing with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Alcee Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to the anaesthetic in 8 percent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Can't even pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.</seg>
<seg id="63">More and more patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Sick, suffering from pain, always say the same thing: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not necessarily mean "I wish I had a presumption," which means "I want to make it easier for me."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The establishment of this report was made possible thanks to a grant from the journalistic Research Institute of Health Canada.</seg>

<seg id="14">He was suspected of receiving bribes neodnocratnom when using government contracts.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, the indictment was charged with several engineers service railways Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter detonated a bomb, after the investigation of the "system" of obtaining government contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Within a few years Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts, in Montreal, some intermediary, linked to the mafia, which, in turn, to translate the money party mayor geralda Trembley "joint Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="18">In the 2000 "s Zambito soril money right and left. He listed more than 88 million Canadian dollars (about 68 million euros) to the various parties in the province, mostly liberals who came back in power.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec offers a limit of up to $100 donations to parties, but, he said, it will not change the situation: "as long as we are not going to strictly limit political spending, in politics are dirty money."</seg>
<seg id="37">It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing of political parties: "we cannot fall below; boldly into the details of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"Paris St Germain - not FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season you're in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary scope.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this growth?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by the individual conscience, but can - and a new dimension of Paris St Germain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next to them I'm growing every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Technical staff also brought a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during the match, it's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything is happening very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I'm not raspaliaius.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the beginning, in the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF in clerfontain and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always strode forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you will benefit from the competition, Carlo Ancelotti....</seg>
<seg id="14">Topping this summer is not a novelty to play matches a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training session is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the fact that such a player like me, wants to be at the level and the place to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He helps substitutes such as Claude makelel, who played in the same position that I have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the owner of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti commands respect all the technical staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, in the first league he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with great players. "</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring new titles of Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had with him was reassuring conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I moved from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust, which he has, also explains my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think of the first part of the season, PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league leader Lyon took the place.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still ready.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is the Champions League: we are spectacularly qualify in one-eighth finals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, all can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to accept the return match in one-eighth finals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Paris St Germain will become the first European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has a budget for this...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and consolidate its position in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, it is not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially from Paris St Germain have the means to make the project viable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not to take the title in the first league, as last season, will be the biggest failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a big disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, we are valid ardently wish to win the league title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were to this close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, it was a disappointment, because we had everything to come to finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the other team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think, will be all right.</seg>
<seg id="53">Despite the fact that in the fight for the title have such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that we expect much, given how much has been invested and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We are fully ready for this.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we chose home 4-0 against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder, what to do in the first place people expect from us.</seg>
<seg id="59">We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We're trying to implement the project of the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed with time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to the modern challenges.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester United, who already has two season fails to pass the one-eighth finals, although they also spent a lot of money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead of the winter time failing.</seg>
<seg id="66">It would be a disregard for our opponents and to the Championship in France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new Paris St Germain.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows how compelling the first league.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Paris St Germain, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">So what if they say that there is a "zlatanozavisimost."</seg>
<seg id="72">It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he has scored a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">He came to this, and he proves that he is the star of the first league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people who surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he did, it's really exclusively.</seg>
<seg id="78">It stimulates and others to improve his game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How do you survived the Euro-2012 with France?</seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I ardently wished to participate in the euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I've seen there many things, and I came out stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I was able to play a good qualifier matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I hoped for since my baptism in blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think of the first months of Didier deshama led blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They for him successful.</seg>
<seg id="90">He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would not want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified the US into the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier desham lead Blue in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Good deserved the draw (1-1), вырванная October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match has given us confidence in themselves.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought for all.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before the shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The exact opposite of the current currency exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between parties from receiving commission fees on their treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as often happens with these technologies, a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, Bitcoin, invented Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure exchange of the BitTorrent protocol, which allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200,000 operations have already been registered with the 15,000 computers in the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand sites take bitkoyny for donations or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The course bitkoyna, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before returning today about ten dollars (courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.</seg>
<seg id="10">He describes as "the most successful bitcoyne virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "loans" used to advance in a video game, which made during the game, or who may buy (and sometimes exchanged).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook also has developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the operation is always exchange controls and processes any central authority.</seg>
<seg id="14">In bitcoyne all nodes network are simultaneously holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers exchange, poccupatelymi and vendors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users actually happens between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">The only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information relating to this deal, signed by electronically, using encryption system with a double switch.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network also can check the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the contents of the file, you might check that bitkoyny used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounts book, razoslanary across the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A key step is the registration of new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">She passes through the decision of mathematical tasks, razoslanary computers, decided that, if temporary, the central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a phase of hashing file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">"computers take" a new transaction and add to her room, before "хэшировать" all together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros in early).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number is found, other sites are easy to check that it properly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Transaction thus turns nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the purpose of deceiving the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice the topic of the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, decided the task, gets 50 bitkoinov.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, the award regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitkoinov in circulation so limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until one stomillional that leaves still reserve...</seg>
<seg id="32">The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Web sites that provide services Bitcoin, were attacked, and bitkoyny were stolen from the reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">"used defect does not apply to the protocol," said Pierre noise, who recently launched paymium - company payments accomplishing real money using Bitcoin network.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also said about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the money also have this disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="38">The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their resolve.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and дорит Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounts book and found that nearly 80% bitkoinov are not in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">"giant sales" were announced in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">"thirty-thousand dollars were exchanged," glad Jon Holmquist, working in coinabul, which deals with the conversion bitkoinov into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre noise, another author of the benefits for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contact-less payment via mobile phone, but she uses to verify the Bitcoin transactions, thus getting cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The owner of better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just tell the address, which can be "photograph and recognize" phone, says Pierre noise, worry, because he has already thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general trend to revise the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="49">"before the Bitcoin fixed, it will take some time, but the 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB in its report suggests that, by the way, to review the various risks, considered today elevated, in the case of the success of this system.</seg>

<seg id="1">We have gone from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2">What next?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (каписа and Surobi).</seg>
<seg id="4">NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only in the US.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US suffered mostly Afghan farmers, which we are viewed as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and pokalechennymi.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it was in the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to protect their own traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are suffering, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will behave more delicately.</seg>
<seg id="11">The withdrawal of French troops from bases Nijrab, which I watched from a Hill plantation almond trees thanks to French credit, took place in the order.</seg>
<seg id="12">Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">By the end of 2014, invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.</seg>
<seg id="14">The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Taking them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women have paid for obscurantism these farmers, in which their outdid al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved, and in our days.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in the position of dependence.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main characters in the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have turned to dealers, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants, returning from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have discredited; most of them, by the way, even themselves not fought.</seg>
<seg id="22">People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that was not one of the thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed to American generosity: significant outflow of capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The young people are tired of war and its ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">They lived in the modern world while in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65 percent of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">Public schools in the cities are filled, both boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who don't want to go back to the old mrakobesion parties, no to corruption of some leaders.</seg>
<seg id="29">Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the moment, the Army is.</seg>
<seg id="31">Government, which will be to her commander, will be considered legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">Old commanders, ведшие anti-Soviet struggle, is already taking measures to restore provincial militias who would not abide by the central government.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be up to a certain extent decentralizovan, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">The industry has not been put back on its feet, none of the dam does not function, no irrigation system is not repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">All imported; nothing is done, except for vegetables and fruits.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority given to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control over infrastructure would be needed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">There were rumors that Afghanistan has a vast mineral wealth.</seg>
<seg id="41">This only added to the impression that Western countries were present there, only to their boss.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without the energy for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to their export through the mountains, no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese already almost left the Aynak copper deposit months, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remain the biggest employers in the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is also necessary to one day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.</seg>
<seg id="46">A new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, for boys, faculty of the French language at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Egypt's constitution heavy labor</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play all-Bank.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly one week ago, the head of the state Assembly has two additional months to finish the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "violate this word" and "to flout the law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of his followers believe that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be held within 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a very short period of time, which makes the brothers to abandon plans to explain to Egyptians text, article by article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi, seems to have convinced the Egyptians vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, the call for accelerated voting like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, "or you vote for my text, or I leave the emergency powers," which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">Majority of the liberals have not responded to the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="17">In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling is not in a position to convey their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="19">To make the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the brothers and Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is no wonder that in most cases, the articles were progolosovana unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few differences emerged around the day... time for prayers, as some members of the committee decided that the hours of the constituent assembly were improperly configured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of the spotlight, Article 2 eventually remained the same article of the constitution of 1971, that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafi party, for whom the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace the "principles" of the "rules" that would give them more rigorous application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"hypocrisy," "meet the liberals who see in this a PR.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their view, the Islamization of the constitution is going through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point in particular to Article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar advisory role, particularly with regard to verify compliance with Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the expert on Egypt Sophie Pomi, this is worrisome, etc. "people to make decisions that are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."</seg>
<seg id="31">We can see the emergence of theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals, moreover, excited by the fact that the next chancellor of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">"at the moment there is no specific religious interference.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on the text, "it's not the ulama, people with a university education, some were trained in the French system" - calms Alexis blo, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he admits that "around the Article 220 may ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This applies in particular to "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence," Ed.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may be wondering how civilian judges competent to decide about this. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to their religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they have significantly decreased compared to what they were under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious point: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Council of defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also will not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from the Association for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental for freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth prohibited insult that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, none of the articles are no longer speaks for the protection of women, emphasizes chaeba moraef, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word that does not appear in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak yesterday evening on television, and protests are planned today in the second half of the day.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="4">For the most part, the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn money to support their families, remaining at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The law came into effect on December 1, under which each migrant will be obliged to take the test on the knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, life and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">But over time, "the promise of the Federal Migration Service," the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">Though it will take not only the language, but also in Russian history, and the basic law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Knowledge of the language will have to verify and to see, and to extend a work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exception is only for the citizens of those countries where English is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Do not fall under the law and the people who get успевшие certificates and diplomas on education before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>

<seg id="14">The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language of Pushkin, peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, University and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants would be able to pass the tests in all cities; now in Russia opened more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative supported by the introduction of testing and deputies of the State Duma, and foundations.</seg>
<seg id="17">But human rights defenders, before the law came into effect, many times in the press had to ask the question: what it is, in fact, will give?</seg>
<seg id="18">That will change that knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the visitors?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, is to meet representatives of the migration service, "this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor slavery. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Very many say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of Russia's Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan Victor sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights should begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">The system will allow only organized set a 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems appear from migrant workers without jobs, education, not knowing the language, do not have a medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding the language, "said sebelev - future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who, under the guise of helping him" putyovka vsunut "in a terribly close Barack, where he and dozens like him will languish for months without food and documents, вкалывая on 12-14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.</seg>

<seg id="28">Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, recognised that not only did not know the language of the country, in which seek, but also on their own and then write with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, it's not their fault, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even describing primary education.</seg>

<seg id="32">It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, "they confess.</seg>
<seg id="33">"you feel humiliated and incomplete."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, in respect of the law on the language of human rights activists say one important point.</seg>
<seg id="35">The testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the same status no - there will be no test, no further official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"welcome, or outsiders no entrance."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the newcomers say that gain official status in our country is not so simple.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason is the bureaucratic barriers and all the same language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover, the legalization of costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">Here's a false registration can be done quickly and just one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The Russian police officers know that we mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"asking for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan oumed hushkadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"налетай, not скупись, buy painting."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language revealed that there are not only мигрантские false documents for registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several of the "sham" certificates of a language tests have already been seized by the FMS.</seg>
<seg id="48">Fake paper printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, brigands hoping thus to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is twice as expensive procedures of official testing: it will cost Labour migrant in three thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the main challenge in the near future "to protect the system of corruption, to" orange "was not simply buy, converge and representatives of the authorities, and human rights activists.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the meantime, authorities can promise guest workers who are unable to successfully undergo testing for the first time, time to study the basic language course.</seg>

<seg id="25">Its contribution, in the words of Baranec, making weapons manufacturers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"now divorced private gun factories, which do not withstand competition in the international market and thrown weapons from under the floor on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another source of "black" market - smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Especially many comes pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"there are their production, sometimes primitive, and formed the mafia, which organized the flow," explains the former military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The weapons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts thought, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2011, the report prepared by the Center for analysis and the troubled state-management project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Experts analyzed the statements of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Rosstat, criminologicheskaya literature and open data portals on the weapons issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The main part of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market was there "at the hands of the officials, whose work is connected with weapons," according to the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of armed conflicts, at 14 percent of cases occur theft in the stage production of weapons, 5% fall on "Black archaeology."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The seller-consultant of one of gun shops, who asked not to be identified by his surname, insists that the weapons, found black copateliais, has long been nobody buys is too old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most often, as he says, the new party sellers go on a military warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ensign man buys unit, for example, pistol.</seg>
<seg id="40">He was discharged her, pass through the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"he carries it in the city and it sells for $900 euros a share with two shops," he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"the truth is that the police in the course of all cases, so periodically when Burns plan for solving crimes, conducts secret purchases from merchants illegal weapons," added the consultant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"as in the luxury store."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The seller and the buyer is often find each other through acquaintances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I peeped on Web sites, blogs, have not yet responded comrade, who offered to come to the platform "racing," where is the man who Romeo me in the "corner" where we will bargain.</seg>
<seg id="46">The price of a barrel I learned only there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Columnist Victor Baranets military</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I need to get the barrel of a familiar, there is a way out, "says the seller-consultant." I have a friend there, but I'm not sure.</seg>
<seg id="49">Sellers in the markets, but there is also a need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that she is a daughter of tooth fell."</seg>
<seg id="50">I am now even a couple of кастетов достаю through a person, which I am sure.</seg>
<seg id="51">He also their supplies only to me, because I know that I don't rent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">Former military Victor Baranets tried himself in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">The scheme, he said, have not changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He gave the album with photographs, where there was "anything."</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like in a luxury store," recalls the military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer, according to Baranec, does not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, a potential customer, not just buy - we are going with the seller in the forest, there's set target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I was given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon is hitting well, begin to negotiate," he describes the procedure expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Search engines in the Internet posting on the Web sites and groups in VKontakte, where the offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."</seg>

<seg id="1">In the U.S. fast food and supermarket workers strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through the work at hand, "McDonald's" goes up to a quarter of all American teens</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days of America, the wave of protests against low wages in department stores Corporation Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" tacos Bell, "" Wendys "and" Kentucky Fraid chicken. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, no one is predicting that will turn the tide in the ninth shaft or her destined to expire in the early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Shares in support of labor unions and a number of left-wing organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to raising the modest salaries, which receive rank-and-file employees of Walmart and a system of fast food, protest organisers aim is the creation of the trade union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far this sector of the economy almost not covered union movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in the year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America has fallen orgy of cheap sales, annexed by millions of average citizens and sometimes accompanied потасовками.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some workers at Walmart, in which around the world work 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle-class.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Why many wage employees of Walmart come only at work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap, partly because few pay their workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complained of the tough conditions, such as a shortage of trucks or hand-held scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">Typical employee Walmart, to supress 9.5 dollars per hour, this expense not afford, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will raise salaries to Armenia to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the company at 3.2 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, every visit to the store will do them all to 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the year, they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that the protests have occurred only in nine states and did not cause any damage maleyshchego Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"black Friday," continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total of its cash registers produced in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Company spokesman Dan Fogelman left the site claimed in an interview with The Huffington Post that jobs out of a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just a "gimmick" another deadline-slaughtering its union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"free tickets!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore there is no), McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumein Williams, a member of the City Council of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food restaurants with time it improves, but only slightly, and the average of their rank-and-file workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Fewer of them in this expensive city not earning one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How can you live in New York for the money is incomprehensible to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through McDonald's took place almost a quarter of American teens who podrabatyvali for their mystery after school, living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw it as a main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now, I happen upon interviews with workers "macdonaldsov" who complain that they have to live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the Forum newspaper, the Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author of the notes that irresponsible to have children, if you don't know what you're going to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protest, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the fast-food cooks and cashiers system began to pay a minimum of $15 per hour, have more than doubled their current minimum salary.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that the fast food in the area were established trade union organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, Bush rarely makes them to life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But cover Union fast food is difficult, and for obvious reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main - unusual turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The dissenters</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highlight of the event was in the middle of the Day rally at the McDonald's near Times Square, which was organized by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council jumein Williams, declared: "McDonald," says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de Blasio, declared that "we must join together in support of fast-food workers so that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every New York yorkets!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described what happened to the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it took only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, which in New York are employed tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">While it is unclear whether this will produce sparks the flame of the mass movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">"as long as the fool the brain is secondary."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality lately taken to perceive primarily through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But the conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D technology laboratory in cambridzhsk Microsoft Sharam Izadi follows that for scientists this company points - passed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"please tell us, please, in general terms, what does your team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"we are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So far, the mass of humanity stuck on the stage of the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes тыканья finger at them.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox and Xbox Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox Kinect today without not sold, because all the interesting vestovoe management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"that still awaits us ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"despite the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction on a physical level, much still going on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of improved information system (gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, working on a true 3D display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projective.</seg>
<seg id="15">Need to release the computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"what do you think about the voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">The popular thing, but not overestimate it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"it certainly is not a panacea - question privacy, because you don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places we had a project, in which we thought over gestures, but not over the swinging, and over such parsimonious, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not camera devices, and naręcznym bracelet, which registered movement of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">While he is big, but in theory it could be reduced to the size of a wrist watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"it's like?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"for example, how can you ask me to give you this bank carbonated drinks?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say, and at the show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"I usually just say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- that is, you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not at the moment the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think in the near future, we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that allow more accurately determine the reaction of the person.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"if you talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, which you claim to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Not enough permission, depth or something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"in principle, the current generation is something from which we can build in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it is good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1,000 to / from.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not the megapixelons themselves, as well as the matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">The last point of view of all current technology is not good enough for us - it adds to the work of the designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">That is, we need to remember not only about a resolution on axes X, Y, and z.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movement of the person quite dynamic, and current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen betishes from our redmondsk laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between humans and machines.</seg>
<seg id="47">In my work, I would be very useful in the equivalent of such a device, not only requires kasanions to frames per second was more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"and to increase the number of cameras don't need?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">"now there are three" Kinect camera, "one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second - receiver reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is already the third luggage is, in fact, the usual sensor visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially more cameras could solve the problem....</seg>
<seg id="53">Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of payments.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinect, play with the curvature of cameras and see how it will help in determining the three provisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You don't think that from the point of view of day-to-day use technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"of course, all the time slob, holding a smartphone in the raised hands, not very comfortable, but here's what I think: the steep option would be" restricted "keeps the reality, when on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch with points on a smartphone, the projection screen and then everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Points are very personal device, in that their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time weakness is supplemented by the reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects, together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only Tony Stark from" Iron Man, "but also an ordinary mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one problem, which often pointed criticism of such ideas: no tactile feedback.</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands didn't feel!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- in his lectures I often say that amended the reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the eighth could well become a supplement of tactile sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a kind of a background for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">She is perfectly registers clicking!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are technologies that are really focused on making this "pictures in the air," Mama - for example, electron beams ultrasound several aimed at a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense of, but it is very weak - as if you're blowing on pads.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are bracelets on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">"and you were trying to trick the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"this is a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is another challenge, which will have to fight for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - work and on the concepts of cross-country trails (not such as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as the huge balloons.</seg>
<seg id="73">Fool the brain until it turns medium, work is still very for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researcher - many things in absolutely infancy.</seg>

<seg id="12"> "I chose the red color as a fashion designer, whose views and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world of red color is a compromise between the artist, the maker and society.</seg>

<seg id="21">I became friends with artists of the new wave, with postgaznevschina, which led to the "Pushkin-10," and more waves.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">I think that the choice is small.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, only two of these planets that you can develop at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it's Venus and Mars," said senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute, P.K. Sternberg (presently) Vladimir surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if conditions on Mars is more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus - the temperature to 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.</seg>

<seg id="17">And then begins the problem.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the problem with the fact that this nestling must find a support, he should get back on their feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of medical and biological problems (imbp) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Not finding support, chicks randomly rolled around.</seg>
<seg id="20">But after 10 hours in newborns was full of atrophy instincts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks not react to light and sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And there the trouble was that after four days they just died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"and the two times we vyluplyali chicks, after it refused, because it is simply impossible there to work with them," says the failure of an experiment with Birds in Space Vladimir sychev.</seg>

<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the biosputnik "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">It was an experiment with mice, which sent into space, already with fruit.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, there is not found nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it's just been on biosputnikah, but again, this is a single experiment, and such research should be done," said Vladimir sychev.</seg>

<seg id="36">For ethical reasons such experiments are not.</seg>
<seg id="37">But the women in space travel is already 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk was the Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">But the most precious, that there is a humanity, is a woman's body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Seagull flew, and no one on earth could not say whether he will continue after the flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">Whether she will give birth to a child after this flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">"because this question no one answered," says veteran rocket-space industry Vakhtang vachnadz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child andriyan Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana savitsk, twice the orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, the son was born.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, the risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have a little, there are few astronauts, who after long flights all cost, and is growing at a healthy generation.</seg>
<seg id="48">"and if more, then it is dangerous even in the orbital flights," summarizes cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And yet, humanity to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity.</seg>

<seg id="51">Here in the neutral buoyancy astronauts spend skills to work in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water simulates weightlessness.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="53">If the water for adults, let and comfortable, but still alien environment, for infants - native element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ichthyandra seems to confirm - life on land emerged from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a link between what the kid is about 9 months from her mother in okoplodnaya liquid, then it is easier to get used to the water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, runs in just two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"this is a very little to do something to forget," says instructor grudnichkovogo diving Marina aksyonova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In other words, if a child born weightlessness more natural state, for women - the necessary gravity, the force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Very quickly in weightlessness dryachleyut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, the ability to expel the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">Oh well, redesign and it is relying on stimulants generic activities.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can, of course, in a special chamber to go into labor, she will bump him.</seg>
<seg id="62">"and then what?" asks trivial questions Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">With no sense of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system.</seg>
<seg id="65">The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, put in a special load costume for training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">He simply will be deprived of that he will be essential.</seg>
<seg id="67">"and this experiment, in which we are with you go, assuming the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to what we bring to the ground disability, fully disadaptirovannogo person," he predicts, head of the Committee on bioethics imbp Ras Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, after a while, it will be a reality, when the Earth on their ships go on a faraway planet, which will become home to their descendants, born in space.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of the unregistered management: checking Schwartz-system failed at the hands of politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good body control and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lags behind in its implementation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security Audit Department, from the interview for the site aktualně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"the law will never be perfect, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough," said the current situation of Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practices cited Peter nechasa approach to the so-called Schwartz-system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - is it is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"the law should be established in any way, and if it is something that bans, and the Prime Minister could not resist the work of agencies, who are required to verify and to seek fulfillment of obligations," says Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which was compared legislation on public procurement of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">A parallel investigation that we began, perhaps, two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, the talk that European law says, how should receive government procurement, then it should be national legislation and then also applied in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished verification, revealed some interesting differences - simply put, legislation we can be a "clear and unmistakable," but in practice we have in some respects behind Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, you need to focus on the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But exactly how this project can help you, that he is mean to you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That is the kind of joint control can contribute in efforts to stop clarify laws, reduce and improve the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact that we will reach, lowering the limit orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps, this system переполнится "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the limit is not declined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You're talking about the internal problems of the practical application of the legislation on public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as a functioning system of control in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is such an organization as our KRU (control-revisional management) or it works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the institutions, then there as our Kru is the bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle, there is also a board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of the audit and the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Brh could manage only federal money, we have a public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the federal registration chambers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for the local laws, there is easier than us?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I would not want to compare without concrete evidence, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but we can't say definitely that it is better for everyone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is so, because they are better able to cope with control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">But I have to say that even the main countries faced with many problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If we talk about the domestic legislation, as reflected in your facility amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the legal validity of these amendments are quite short, it still doesn't manifested itself in our work to control.</seg>
<seg id="35">So how we control over the fact that it is necessary to take into account some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we have to use our new tools "risk uneconomnosti detection," through which we turned away nearly 14,000 state contracts. "we analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and, I hope, is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem, which may arise, is that the rules "uzhestochatsya" and it will be impossible to observe.</seg>
<seg id="40">The functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises are related to the supplier (for example, Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In this case, whether to tighten the law in this way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think that is not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit formal mistake, not influencing the decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And then how to get out of this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's recognize that this path will not lead anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the prime minister said that GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. "what does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">"Schwartz-system" is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be established in any way, and if it is something that bans, and the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the authorities, who are required to verify and to seek fulfillment of obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say: "we will change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we'll pretend as if nothing is happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public procurement contains very strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is the right thing. It protects public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of technical problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially, it was my idea, then we are all up together with our artist gonz Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides that, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to work together with the public to think about the state of the world we will pass on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of May the calendar we have created a unique collection of items from the shoes, shirts, bags and original ключиков against Doomsday. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz, and thereby also provide us support.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the purchase of equipment for bezbarriernogo educational center studeo, now in its sixth year, we will work with civil association edlichki tap at the Institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">Teachers regularly attend schools and students of the Institute of edlichki spend with them funny and interesting events.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students themselves do not have the resources to go to the teachers, and so we try to give them the opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the additional construction institute edlichki in the future, there will be a separate building, in which we moved to this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert will perform several musical groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What were the criteria for selection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to draw up a program that interested in all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Bart, the Tap Tap, Marjan банго and Jiri Sukhi.</seg>
<seg id="34">About all the details can be found on the site www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Do you plan to any such "grandiose events" in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, will for the first time to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, to prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">The next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, so if we in the United States, I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About abroad have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">Group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you cope with expensive in terms of organisation and logistics???</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five players on the electric wheelchairs and strollers must travel in the cargo area, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, until done with that, without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA British Airlines and British Airways have always been well prepared for us that surprised me many times.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to the выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">With what you encountered to date?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where everything works better than we have, in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still on a basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared with the Prague in Moscow so many barriers, and here is still in the Bieszczady independent movement of a man in a electric wheelchair in the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also there in the course of such banal things like give way disabled in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, and there already are having a social organizations, who are trying to draw people's attention on the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things, the level of performance which is far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it regards.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is quite normal that people with severe disabilities to move on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, yes anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, and in this we tap tap them with the slightly ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect of the public or bezbarriereness is one thing, but at the moment, when among us will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really start to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">While this is a single cases - people with a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">A group of the tap tap at the present time is very popular, but back two years ago that in 1998 you caused her to organize?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the institute edlichki as a teacher, I had a lot of young people who wanted something to do.</seg>
<seg id="60">And because I am a musician and play the saxophone, along with a colleague organized an interesting music circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, but over time, says our leading Ladia angelovich, it is a bit out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity of the same came only in the last few years, or I have something steps?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on advocacy group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, essentially as if it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Due to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Whether you stood in front of the goal so well turn the tap tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the show-biz is full of things, podrazhayuschey one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, all new taken with caution, and lasts that long.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is very little rare things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, a pity, it is natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this is absolutely izlishnya pity, because people with disabilities are not suffering any and all abandoned personalities, which we should pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are the people who can live a full life and, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if people with disabilities, it turns out, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Lee ensured the success that you are a strong leader, how many of you think?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do the job properly, we should be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think that it is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic notion and fly in the clouds, and when you know that twice a week they must go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it happens in any group that wants to work and to accomplish something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the present time as part of the tap tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were in the early in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one Ladia angelovich.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those who have the desire and the will power, our doors are always open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">He will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The concert will be held at the stadium in Prague Incheba, in Brno and Ostrava fléda - the club is in the centre of plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">At the end of the concert all three cities joined телемостом songs at the time of the execution of the tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years took an active part in a number of projects agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the path to the space Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it's not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I recall, for example, about the lectures and. Sternfeldâ that December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "introduction to космонавтику."</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Yang gadomsky was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934, won the prize in France Sternfeld Robert esno-peltrated and Andre Luiz hirsca for "introduction to космонавтику."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Yang gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space exploration.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomsky propagandist space became known to the world, and his contribution was estimated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway drezina, equipped with missile engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear, even to disperse or for braking carts was supposed to be used rocket.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about this drezina known only from the newspapers of the era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about the missile стрелах.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study conducted in cooperation with the weapons technology section professors mieczyslav wolfk and Gustav mokzhitsky.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of the remaining material shows that research has reached the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the arrival of German troops work were interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 in the specialized press appeared idea фотоэлектрической missiles and fighter, which offered engineer rogozinsky, and the following year was the work of "air rocket-powered aircraft and rocket-and-bomb" author Leliv-kzhivoblotskogo.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war all projects military use of missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of work by the end of the start of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of the Journal of 1954, "problems," in which four-dimensional published articles on Astronautical.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them, Professor M. subotovich offered to organize a society that will be cosmonauticals.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the start of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ooa) attempted to join the International Federation Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in autumn ooa became its member.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the next year, the first chairman of ooa Kazimierz zarankevich (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From 1956 ooa contributed to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, vpolnivshei scientific study.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">A rocket capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently, was built enhanced version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on vacant bledovsk were conducted tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the rise in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962, further development was suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Heiress RM became the first missile type missile meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a stage, its total length was 51 cm, and initial weight - 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">The company has developed three types of (marked as a meteor-1A, -1v and -1s), which varied in size camera for scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">Missile meteor-1A had space with 0.4 liters, meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and meteor-1C - 0,62l.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range from all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968 years in the Aviation Institute was the development of a missile meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Missile meteor-2 with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring valuable cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then were built version of the meteor-2n and meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, in the framework of the intercosmos program, Poland participated in studies of outer space for the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav germashevsky became the second intercosmonautom after Vladimir ремека.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution to the problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision provoked a lively debate in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Certainly, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence, this means that a separate economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, no limited movement of private capital, along with untamed financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) raises the price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept, you need to understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to weather the economic competition, the "value" is pushing competitor to pick up a larger share of the market and, therefore, increase their own income.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared with other, high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital has no social responsibility, including and made them unemployment, rising inevitable government spending on social needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the gentlemen of employers to pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that don't need to give specific statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Besceremona methods of private capital to create economies at the level of individual states situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other in order to artificially reduce social level of its population, with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the governments of their own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected in the changes to the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is to make its economically Aquapark Aquapark people to obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the areas of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor laws.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of the rising level of poverty, and at the same time, and the gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves their own labor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already approaching one million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the framework of improving the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occur cases when employed people receive a salary that the state should mention them, so they have a living wage.</seg>
<seg id="23">A similar scandal became known to the public, and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same end, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or live in poverty-level wages on the margins of society in the hope that someday in the country will come to a private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the question is, where he will undertake?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the funds will come from other EU countries, poverty is to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for the share of wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This for all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in the actions of the managers of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then the question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically managing policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">The answer is a definite yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, we have a hopeless situation, emerging in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department because of a lack of financial resources electrical design bills to private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills approved by the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution, and from the financial-powerful groups who prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously, the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns in such an aquapark Aquapark situation, as described Appian at work, "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "the state has long breaks, and agencies are responsible for the violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegally obtaining no favours with stones and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went into the election with a pre-sold voice... "" decent people never ran for the post of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul "...." seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic person.. "Appian thought that it would be a Pompey, but they became Caesar, who had replaced democracy and autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without regard for the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Now the result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">That means the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy such as can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Above all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are now witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition on both the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of population.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus, this trend is systemic.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is the target of political and social reforms that will strengthen the fractional state involvement in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="6">I don't want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings is a criminal and who is the victim, in the end, today's Israeli citizens, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not been seen at the beginning of the violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, look at who primarily serve continues for 95 years of tension (apart from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my reasoning supported by historical facts, some of them are taken on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so clear is whether these people are taking their own steps, or for their throne was someone who guided their actions to a pre-set goals.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and arising out of them, the authorities could not for the life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be seen as the head of the octopus (don't know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lot of them don't write.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the '90s of the 19th century, to stop the rumors, linking their name with criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shade of which they were, and that always led to consolidate their power, the attainment of wealth or both, and to another.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are large stakes in almost all central banks around the world, and against the countries whose central banks do not have its share, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has assumed a central bank of the country in their own hands.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for rothschildowski Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to produce their own (ponymay) - government money and was assassinated in 1865, in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst for world power in 1859, the year 1871 led to the development of the plan three world wars, created by the great Mason 33 level-Albert Pike.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first task of the war has been the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially in the UK, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (of so many slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be other than as a precondition for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method, which works with the help of a group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao - order out of chaos.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the base of the Fed, which would prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war, by the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne габсбургского Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the tsarist Russia, starting Bolshevik revolution.</seg>
<seg id="26">The first world war ended with the sudden, posts and economically untenable in the surrender of Germany (there was no need for a war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing Central European powers, Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">To facilitate the launching of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing a huge war reparations Germany than created a precondition to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then the Germans had only given strong enough, oblicayuschego perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational alight with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, fueling the fire of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the history of the Jews with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">Above the Balfour Declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to happen the first clash with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler extricated himself from the chains, in which he was initially kept the bankers, or anything that he did, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was triggered by the military reparations on the first world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed, in order to create a nest of war by a third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If international bankers to manage its start, the Jewish people, and in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take just a sharp divide people on the supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for a world power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Here we need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like the US, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections for their own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to the international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and taking control of Iran over the latter chokepoint containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), "also will lead to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In light of the now are the words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: "all we need is a total crisis, and people will accept the new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their view is the World Masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy, naslajdayuscheisha comfort.</seg>
<seg id="41">A world where everyone born body at birth implanting chip, with whom he becomes a, which is under total control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"and it makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slave have on the right hand or forehead on stigma, so that people who are not marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.</seg>
<seg id="43">That is the wisdom: everyone who has a mind, can calculate the number of the beast.</seg>
<seg id="44">Because it is the name of the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film "operation" Argo ": when the worse, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, demonstrators seized a crowd of Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were supposed to be freed in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which have been the patron of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The US administration for a positive outcome of the situation is not productive - she could not afford to throw overboard Shah, because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not in the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate has triggered a wave of solidarity and antiiranski sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defeat in Iran has largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election-year ended September election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film, srezhessirovanny actor Ben Affleck, "Argo" describes the operation as "one of the episodes of history that has brought America small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of six workers managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">After some serious troubles they finished their way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, the extravagant legend helped cover, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as members of the crew, podyskivavshie in place for the filming of science-fiction epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">The legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation for a long time held in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film аффлека is a special blend of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film-kinoopus," the story of a successful venture, scam - example could be a series of films about friends оушена.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, the documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (in a caption shown significant historical photographs of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the movie "big differences in this no).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, overlapping with irony and a slight exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits are discussing the situation at the tables of negotiations on the stairways institutions, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck рестарт remarkably managed to make a career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="25">"operation" Argo, "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, baby, Goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" The Town "(2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, this is the first film аффлека, who has not appeared in the hometown of director - Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of the atmosphere of the place that belongs to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck is shown in "Argo," where Tehran "plays" Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and непредвиденности that arise when it suddenly changed history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters in the Tehran Bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Far too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative suggests many exciting scenes of cinematic values.</seg>
<seg id="33">He has been working successfully with this little, sometimes something further elaborated - there's all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America, to prevent the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Chase on the landing strip look pretty farfetched).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Lack of "Argo" is a distraction, associated with the need to show there are too many things in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of a Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters deserve to have more space, and they are not alone in the film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this film, which you can watch with moderate interest, in assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating nature of the Seventies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But captures with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated notions about the Almighty and vseznayuchyh security services.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, performing the annual survey of the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd judgment or project from the workshop of the EU."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"we made the last event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," he said, "the law," organizer Patrick Nager questionnaire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the charges on the nomination absurdities - the recent decision by the European court of unification of the premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">So far, the women have benefits for life insurance, because insurance companies they objectively are less prone to risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can nominate the competition until the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will be held before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The EU's controversial orders include, for example, and mandatory fuel Rekreacji Sp, adding that as a result of the harmful nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury gradusnikov only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive or the size of the cages for chickens, eggs rose significantly this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Also criticized was subjected to a de facto ban on the use of the term "buterbrodnoye butter" or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">High-quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Pan-European aid often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels is usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even threatened veto defends the demands of their banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of the lobby are: for example, bananas are of the highest quality in the EU were supposed to reach 14 cm in length and doesn't dare show "unusual curvature."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the European Commission is justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing piecemeal national rules that are complicating trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The EU, despite resistance from some member states, yet softened standards concerning the fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to rastochenia products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The winning candidate in the poll may become and last year's decision by the EU, according to which sold balloons must contain a warning that children under eight years can't finagle their without adult supervision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU has asked the American research, in accordance with which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">That restriction now applies to children up to 14 years, which is prohibited blow in the trade fair dudelki.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Funny ideas are born and at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Enough is absurd and rule on the European officials: anyone who has the EU any official position, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, the use of the name Macedonia, and should instead talk "FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of noninterference" ("laissez faire), offered to vote, in addition to several above absurd rules, for example, usually the EU about the amount of food stocks in the territory of the membership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks, which can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently, the Czech Republic than, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in some countries and the idea of paying for what they don't have sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the statement about getting subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"we are in an uncomfortable position, because we don't have the sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ask the European Union for compensation, "he said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As the argument, he pointed out that the country was high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying state had full warehouses stocks, which had to be taken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to паласу, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, arranging a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages, the Ministry of Regional Development, extradited minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU: bizarre orders are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the resolution in member states can easily become the target of critics, the efforts of the EU on regulation, as well as more effective functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A major problem, according to experts, is cherpanie EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved when discussing the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Evokes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians retained the name "olomoucki curds," but "tuzemsky rum," tradition in our country, which has its roots in the 19th century, our producers have to rename the "thusemak."</seg>
<seg id="36">Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The official list of registered products to the EU, along with the world-famous "feta cheese" and "gorgondzola," marcipanom from German Luebeck or Parma ham, has already proved, for example, Karlovy Vary breadcrumbs, pogorzelitsky and teresebonsky carp and jatetsky hops.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I don't think about that to become a senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If we in the country all functioned without problems, then I'm not running.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can't see how over the past 20 years the country разворовывается, as thieves scurrying around here, people raise taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to be a politician..</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that I don't like, then try to find a solution, as it change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I was four years old and I am an independent man, not belonging to any party, I don't have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate, you were, but soon went to the presidential palace.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whether you are thus not turn back to the people that you choose?</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11">I always said that vklyuchus in the struggle for the presidential palace, depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I said that if I am elected senator, will run for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I need to have the greatest influence and vast powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not only that we as a nation have ropschem himself in a bar or on TV, but are willing to trample anyone who tries to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">Added to the media that person ochernyayut, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, I was told that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri paroubeka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Go to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">The struggle for the presidential Castle you started with a thesis about the material and criminal liability of politicians and on the back of property declarations on the amount above 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To this, it is necessary to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You do not have such powers as president, and only a Senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as a citizen lobbying to conduct tours became free enterprise, it managed to advance.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is playing politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately thwarted, and it deters citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent bespartisanogo person I have a much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I have no party raskladyvaniya through, without regard to the tenets of each party can take what is best for our country, and apply it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of the parliament will remain only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with that in politics you don't hold on.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk to them, you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility?</seg>
</p>

<seg id="41">I have no other opportunities.</seg>

<seg id="54">I went to radzim yanchur, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also I at least supported a leading investigative journalist Jan lorentsov, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil.</seg>

<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose members of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">Us independent in the Senate, only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="60">Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="61">You think about the basis of their own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I haven't thought about it, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I don't have the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You don't have the money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You're talking about property declarations, but what about your own affairs with this?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="66">Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have a plot in Prague at a cost of about 25 million, the apartment on a 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, the collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Skoda SupHerb per million, and even a few million on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">Incidentally Aston-Martin for me, because it was my malchishechya dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was a gallant with women and at the same time, fought against the meanness and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You travel to Aston-Martin, own property on the 60 million and you don't have the money to the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the country, but particularly in this to invest their own money does not want.</seg>
<seg id="71">It is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have a 15-million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I have to climb into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">The campaign, I have already invested 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign out of pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">Spending on the campaign I essentially will cover senatorskaya salary.</seg>
<seg id="78">But on this money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English School, which is worth 30,000 monthly.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to just make money, so there would not be nominated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So, the next you'll be doing business in order to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Don't you say that reduce this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, I partially reduced its activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would like, that I was bessrebrennikom, which will keep the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also need to something to live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive monthly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Between 200 and 400 thousand that get and further.</seg>
<seg id="89">But if I became president, his business would be finished.</seg>

<seg id="1">The architects MVRDV argue that these adventures are not only in the imagination - for example спейкениссе and his newly built book Mountains -- 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"to me it seems fun, it looks футуристично, finally we once again you can see something interesting," said Lizette verkhaig, prokhojaya on the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Stefan spermon, an expert on it at the nearby large company, said: "no, it really beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I ask myself: why do we today, another library?</seg>
<seg id="5">All have access to the Internet, the iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now nobody voluntarily do not go to such old-fashioned library, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Спейкениссе, maloprimechatelnomu balconomu campus in Rotterdam, belongs to the unusual record.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To deal with this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro notes, in the form of richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the city fathers understood that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame Maas from Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold столбчатых diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, take to the task with his usual unflappable and appeared on the competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, sassy Maas folded from his original gift pyramidku in size and completed it in defense of his project with the words: "dear citizens!"</seg>
<seg id="14">Here it is, my proposal: "book Mountain" in спейкениссе, the so-called bukenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, this mountain of $30 million euros grew.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes the underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several nearby houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November, "the book Mountain" was awarded second prize in the contest "the best library of the Netherlands 2012."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project also participates in the national Dutch competition wooden structures of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, the faceless suburb, who could not suggest anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely town hall, the white facades which suggest a molokozavod, became richer than the one modern piece of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the most important thing is the спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: repetition of Eldorado under Egypt for cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is only one elevator, held in the center of the mountain range, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ostecklenno from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of bricks and elegant street lamps unerringly creates a sense of public town square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is recreated.</seg>
<seg id="26">View unwittingly looking benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere - books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"usually the bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a dark room, usually a comfortless and faceless," says blame Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have set the classic configuration of space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner space book mountains used skillfully: in the center of the offices, online library, chess club, ecological center and technical facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Particularly pleasing black bookshelves that serve that cover the walls, then парапетами, лестничными railings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their appearance, texture and smell of unusual.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even sophisticated architects and engineers lost in the roadway, what is the unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are eager to work with secondary materials," explains Joop trauborst, head of the project, representing community спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a by-product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining the roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a cheap and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thin textile serves a one-two of the season, after that he can throw it away.</seg>
<seg id="39">The library is a canvas - for the first time in such quantities - was in the thick spressovano four centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of the heat and pressure of the so-called landbauplastic (klp) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, according to smell a bit like a new car and a little sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The top of the lead 105 steps.</seg>
<seg id="42">Whoever wins the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic views of the city, but also the Dutch croquetami ficuses and baptized in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care about the environment, and in the first place about the proper humidity on literary grief.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The cost of a new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"it is hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of the environment," says trowboarst.</seg>
<seg id="46">It is used for heating and cooling the warmth of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book Gore is under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="48">Large farms from laminated wood, placed perpendicular to the glass case, provide shade and make the most of the sun's rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the protection to provide fully automatic roller-blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan spermon, mentioned above skeptic of it, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lizette verkhaig also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also teaches traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, which is called the "soul bukenberg спейкениссе, which has long lacked."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own assembly.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves is still not fully staffed libraries - at that time it was 70,000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves laden with top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"there is nothing worse than polupustai library," says the architect blame Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that, thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with this new home.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is only for decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which is on the professional jargon called the creation of an identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Спейкениссе wrote his literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And even if they are very young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is only a starting point for building identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clogs: "the Germans should play a more important role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, and in doing so, Berlin teetering on the narrow diplomatic track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: in the early weeks of Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians "application for observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why? "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that the American position she also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical towards Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of the forbidden zone for flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is so.</seg>
<seg id="15">The point is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from the policy, which, so to speak, led by the United States, to the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent unified policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that as long as they only track their role, but we are on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such a foreign policy, which is France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly does "normal" foreign policy with the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It is a willingness to hold the position of their national interests, not dependent on the position of the United States or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany in the largely differ from the interests of other large states, and that is why Germany must protect their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Influenced whether these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether Germany навредила its relations with the United States, refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote of the Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I don't think that it was the same dramatic nadlom, as in the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps, Germany even will thus a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is a signal that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage, and that its interests must be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, by contrast, clearly voted for the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The strength of the American domestic politics such differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, can't openly to hold such a position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that significant differences of opinion is not so significant, as it always is.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, I notice that Obama is not as enthusiastic about the policies of Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the major partner in the EU on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not so.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they can't act as part of a broader approach and have to instead act, relying only on his own vision of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">That is the way they come with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that for Germany is not easy, at least because of their links with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This issue has always been a sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not take it upon themselves to really lead role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or the leading role still struggled in Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not accustomed to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still has always struggled to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time when Germany takes over the role, are the most different feelings of boycott.</seg>
<seg id="57">The Germans are not just to cope with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, but it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, the influence of the United States in European politics permanently diminished, but at the moment the EU not to fill this vacuum, then who is?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans simply have to play a more significant role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you don't like, unpleasant or strengthens dislike for you - such is life!</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"the protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is the world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is the Armani polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is officially registered in China, the name, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then, it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas pattloh, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights to the trademarks in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Imitators enough to add a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">So from Gucci, Lu-Gucci, Prada, you can register a Prada-kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">The same way legally copied German companies, such as sporting goods maker Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloh opens the folder with records office registration of trademarks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which is also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese are the world champions, copied and violation of intellectual property rights, known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities have a multilevel stores that sell almost exclusively of forgery.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, no such cases pattloha. On behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the agency the right to use the name of the registration of trademarks, which already is somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "ban minpay," Mark-passenger.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a word associated with "ban dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">The so-called women who are hunting for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilt</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"it damages the business, with the need to fight," he convinced pattloh.</seg>
<seg id="22">"trademark erodes, unique position is lost, the image of a very much suffering."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research firm CLSA, China with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third-largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.</seg>
<seg id="25">But achieving the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court rejected claims, because after a long time oprotestovannoe name has become "the reality of the market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff is lucky, he will have to pay even plugiator, as damaged his trade sign in China, says pattloh.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes here ruled by the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a famous case of graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, the company Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, Enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired-manufacturer Putzmeister concrete.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">Geely bought Volvo company initially used the blue-and-white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not consider himself guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The registration of trademarks ctmo office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the past year was "the return of the emergency situation in a workflow to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the number of unprocessed affairs on objections decreased by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was closed nearly 140 millon such cases, 75 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">With this is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As very often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is a record and means that China is the tenth consecutive topped the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the agency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, was paid $1.8 billion yuan fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">If we simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Her appeal is worth many times more, as shown in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans managed to achieve that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been liquidated.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the simulator cemented the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was his own omission, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, said hanno wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg chemical setting in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the registration of trademarks ctmo münchentsev rejected the claim.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the stronger side continues to struggle so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Need to be on guard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good finish and praise the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Domestic spending is unlikely to yield accounting, archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago, to give evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, vain Freudenberg suggested adverse side of the "great shestiznachnaya amount in Euro" for the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"it is clear how expensive it is," says wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The danger of the Far East threatened to break even in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">But just in case, if the simulators register there the unprotected trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this unable to prevent the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"we need to be vigilant," says wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer pattloh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international law on the protection of trademarks, most foreigners should be "all that is in any way is to protect, to register also in China," says wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can do much more expensive than check.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if the Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the trade mark, it will have to pay to the adverse party licensing fees for its own sake, explains wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise we will push the market segment in the dark.</seg>

<seg id="20">The imbonga zulusskoye language means narrator or voskhvalitel.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this room don't speak fluent in the Bantu, but know how to sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nearly ten years choir разучивает songs on this strange soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">The distance from хайдельберга 8733 kilometers of the summer, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of eSitjeni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus -ic.</seg>
<seg id="27">In a nutshell eSitjeni reflected the disease only Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Male circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, among the population of almost not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's population are the human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth of a dozen is not uncommon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants imbogni saw many children in the streets, which lacked not only of parental care, but just barely: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without school education a person in a poor country, there is no chance.</seg>
<seg id="32">At first it was a private commitment to individual members - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.</seg>
<seg id="33">But a year later, he founded the Association "chorus of voices for Africa," which has since almost professionally takes care of orphans of AIDS in eSitjeni.</seg>

<seg id="34">Facts about the infections, sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important disease, sexually transmitted?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea Tripper ().</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human папиллома-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lobkovy pediculosis and scabies belong to паразитарным STIs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main porajaemye group?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly among men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch Institute stems from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between the men.</seg>
<seg id="42">The heterosexual adults often point of STDs, are chlamydial infection, trichomoniaz, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human папиллома-virus.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the youth chlamydial infections are significantly more often than among other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European sources, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">We among young people also often found human папиллома-virus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Changing the number of cases of infection?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all of the disease, sexually transmitted, subject to mandatory registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections in 2007, dropping.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints during urination, selection, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the bubbles or seal.</seg>
<seg id="55">But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect yourself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but did not provide 100% protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Partly because agents sexually transmitted diseases that can be spread by contact infection and through close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">The early diagnosis can be cured most STIs and avoid the remote consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Patronage, donations and not least honoraria for speeches chorus throughout Germany allow something to collect.</seg>
<seg id="62">"all we sent in eSitjeni already about 200 000 euros," says Annet Lennartz, chairman of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village of money from Germany manages tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.</seg>
<seg id="64">She also cares about orphans were well-organized, for example, one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogos, as called on zulusskoye older women, it is the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them shelter and take care of the children in the form of every day to appear on the lessons.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who did not go home, go to the shelter to haniysil, lonely woman, receives a salary from the association, as well as two поварихи who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, the association "voices for Africa" organized Sewing School, built two henhouse and with the American Health Organization PSI organized surrender analysis on HIV for many residents of the village.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so evident throughout the country, prefer deep silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annet Lennartz, "because he is associated with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The black Africa's last absolute monarch, King мсвати III, known for his love of largesse.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, the Chinese state-style of life also lays the blame for the fact that the virus has spread so quickly and in past years.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it is also a stray workers who carry the virus in the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annet Lennartz, "but they almost do not use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Another culture - flesh-to-flesh. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">A little support to cultural exchanges, the choir ibmogni every two to three years, making a trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale and confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know since the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that has happened, provoked tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The trip is also leads in eSitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.</seg>
<seg id="82">Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on a map in the Valley of the river etsulveni she more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"go in eSitjeni, there is light," said local people.</seg>
<seg id="84">But after 8733-km flight back in Heidelberg, when topajošiem singers return to репетиционный bergheimer facilities on the street, you can see that this light burns also here.</seg>

<seg id="51">Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans lipperosgeem - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the Mirror optical telescopes were becoming increasingly available - and their view of space deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope, "part" in the observatory Palomar under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.</seg>

<seg id="59">Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: telescope firmly stamped at a vertical angle is limiting his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The telescope "Hobby-eberli" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">His feature: high svetosobirayushchaya ability.</seg>

<seg id="12">Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they are fluent in Farsi and azerbaizhdanskom and different longevity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The final point is leric.</seg>
<seg id="14">A small town flaunts too ponderous architecture of Soviet times, which is not in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>

<seg id="1">The word "human right" is not in the Constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The revolution returned to Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rival demonstrations in Cairo show the deep rift in the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The future constitution, based on sharia, met fierce resistance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian president not funded the pathos.</seg>
<seg id="6">We must create a transition.</seg>
<seg id="7">"and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was turned to all people, but in the first place to the Christian coptm, liberals, enlightened Muslims and religious Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">After all, they are all still hopelessly fragmented in nonplussed by the opposition, fear.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he was temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the University of Southern California, did not entirely clear Egyptians and around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Will there be deprived of the power of the judiciary?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In fact, 234 articles have managed to smuggle in a 15-hour jump with obstacles on the Islamic configured constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly raises fears.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the trial is based on "the principles of Islamic law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But that means "principles"?</seg>
<seg id="17">It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and we fear that Islamists will use blurred formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least, it suggests one novovvedyonnaya article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, should be encouraged for the Council of the University of al-Ashar, crucial Islamist institution in the country with great authority in Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">It should not, but may mean that the clergy enforces laws that de-facto restriction would be the result of the judiciary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the draft constitution much is subject to interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another problem: should be retained jurisdiction of civilians in military court.</seg>
<seg id="22">These courts during the rule of Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family," and "maintain its morals and values."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Legally it formulated so vague that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of the film and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">Open text, it means nothing, as censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In general, no article does not set right the equality of men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.</seg>
<seg id="29">But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also questionable is the wording that prohibited "insulting people."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether there will be enough cartoons of the president or jokes about правоведа?</seg>
<seg id="32">The question of interpretation, like many in this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and who, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"the revolution is back."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="34">For several weeks, formed the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unanimity on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the revolution is back, and we win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place finisher in the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed el-Baradei said that the draft constitution place "on the scrapheap of history."</seg>
<seg id="38">A short news service Twitter followers he accused Morsi's desire to lead a "coup against democracy."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if he declares referendum, we will go to his palace and skinem him," said opposition Yasser said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"we are still not tired, the blood of our brothers have not otmzena," he quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.</seg>
<seg id="41">Many of the judges also said that he did not want to watch the referendum that would make it invalid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"the Koran is our constitution."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The well-organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for opposing demonstrations, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters, who shouted: "the people demand the application of God's law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They demanded from Morsi: "очисти country!" and assured: "the Koran is our constitution."</seg>
<seg id="46">The power struggle over the largely symbolic square, where it all began, almost triggered a state of civil war.</seg>
<seg id="47">Supporters of Morsi, quite clearly, did not want to go to this risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"the Muslim Brotherhood, said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution argued loudly and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.</seg>
<seg id="50">The majority of the Islamists, it is considered a done deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"the notion of" human rights "is not mentioned anywhere."</seg>

<seg id="54">Not because he shared their worldview, but because the human rights for him, indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">For this he was beaten, jailed, arrested.</seg>
<seg id="56">And now the words "human rights" never meet in a new constitution, regrets it in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "</seg>
<seg id="57">The expansion of the influence of Morsi on all three branches of government in the state disappoints lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures represent a significant attacks on democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="59">"instead of having to strengthen the civilian government, president of the de-facto annulled his," regrets Sayeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">After all, without civil organizations democracy cannot function.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Sayeda feels that all left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.</seg>
<seg id="62">This can occur for payment.</seg>

<seg id="2">While the newly Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join the office, a correspondent of the BBC will grant invites us to look at the difficulties, with whom he will have to face, and the mixed expectations of the population of his country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Traffic in Mexico City now in particularly poor condition.</seg>
<seg id="4">This city is overloaded transport and in the best time, and Monday were erected steel barricades, pererezavshie several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, this was done not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protesters to get to the building of the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto sets presidential перевязь and will take the reins of the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Before him is no easy task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which now keeps its powers, but the country is embroiled in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed some 60,000 lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"my government says the people of Mexico about his readiness to deal with violence," he said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I'm going to suggest a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Such statements before the president of the United States, the political career of Mr. Peña Nieto developed to serve as governor of his home state of Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions are divided about the new leader.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A staunch man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Residents put him in the merit of the revival of tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can get to the city on one of the new highway, built by Mr. Peña Nieto, who are very different from the roads with a rut and Yam, who were previously on this place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Signs with his name are hanging on a modern building sports center and the impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"we associate with the hope of real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a congressman from the state led by Peña Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We expect real and decisive change, which is so badly needed in our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI was expelled in 2000, Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, he denied the charges in a meaningless, who put forward the new president of the opposition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He is very прямолинеен and very devoted to the cause of his vision of the future of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a great statesman, and, above all, the people who listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But in other parts of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor.</seg>

<seg id="31">More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during a particularly on Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar measure in the infamous proslavivshemsya violent city of Ciudad Juárez, the name of which sea when it comes to murder innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, about him in the best case, we can say that during his tenure as governor, he was not able to cope with the problem of the killings of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the worst case, however, his administration has been accused of ignoring the problem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican descent.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben navarett believes that Mexicans American-born torn between two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico City, I went down the hall to arrive, approached the border control zone and remained in place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs pointed to the two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for foreign (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I have a few seconds stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and my whole life called Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston called themselves the Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, I stopped on a complex structure, "Mexican American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complex constructions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I was just American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary poorer than the native language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took out his U.S. passport and was in line for the piece.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were usual for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">President of Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to move to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals not sounded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico, relations with the United States - heavy and executed the old grievances question.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded in Mexico and at the barrel rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the Mexicans think centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Why should any of us statesman obmallvitsya though word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately heard complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyayutsya militancy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">This is the most complicated relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to talk about the insults?</seg>
<seg id="29">Their enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country for themselves, and those for whom there is no such opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history of someone's father or grandfather - have not had the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most of these were Mexicans of a certain type of dark complexion, education, from poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are their descendants, and we remember about this.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico, it see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and made ourselves a good job, but we should not forget that even this dream is an American, not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination and запутано is unclear, but we know what the country considered his.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">At the same time, we know that the majority of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class we don't like.</seg>
<seg id="39">We answer to them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people, as the Mexicans inauthentic.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not well speak in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our very existence for them due to failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.</seg>
<seg id="44">We don't have now for the silk curtain, finding in the US smug life, but lost the spiritual connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States, even in childhood, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent, there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin is a shame.</seg>
<seg id="46">She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time, many of my friends, the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">But in the United States have called the Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship without enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Americans to Mexican origin were sort of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell their friends-Americans about what this beautiful country and how cool her visit, and would be able to convince the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yeah, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing will.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many grievances in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, given the gap between rich and poor, widespread corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe that the country is too great.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, check.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And this is true.</seg>
<seg id="61">If a fraction of Mexicans still can't forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico half a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still in Milan for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes it.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battle on the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for further peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Prospects for a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound that became familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in its izvechnom conflict in the Middle East came changes.</seg>
<seg id="7">It can be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" in the breakaway zakruzhili storm many established realities, with the Israelis and the Palestinians have not managed to stay away from the vortex, shaken the region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons, giving hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The war without winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed, occurred on this week's clashes only strengthened security forces on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, protesting against what they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses incurred by them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas is boosting its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the wealthiest and fastest growing states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The victorious Hamas supporters claim on the establishment of the Islamic crescent around Israel from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more proislamistic rebels to overthrow the rule of President Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king is threatened by allies of Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and influential Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are the organization, is largely similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic rasstanovkah Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice can't drown out even to Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time, supporters of the "hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israel's "Iron Dome" missile system justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the abandoned Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israeli citizens can sleep easy, at least for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence in the Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank is a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections set for January 22 - teamed with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What sense condone the Palestinians and give them their own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you give away all the power in their hands on the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from rockets toward Israel, as their brethren in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise their heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps, supporters of the "hard" line victorious; but their calculations can be disproved the Arab Spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">Despite the fact that the Islamists, who have come to power in Egypt and other countries, have had the most warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of Israel's defense budget, more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.</seg>
<seg id="38">War with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pragmatism, president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the ceasefire, which is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.</seg>
<seg id="41">At least for Democratic Change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that would sooner or later explode in the Israeli occupied territories, like the bus, vzorvannomu in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">For the bloody operations, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas movement, has to pay a growing discontent with the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need in the external impetus</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It remains the only solution to which relentlessly call sensible representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, "the hope that the cease-fire would allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which has long time to decide to block the delivery of weapons into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967 with an exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other Arab countries should also make efforts towards reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote in the United Nations, which may result in a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Their role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">After returning to the White House, he continued to show a reluctance to connect to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is disastrously недальновидная position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Australia, the law came into force on the unified packaging for cigarettes.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the hazards of smoking and disease affected by images of body parts stand in contrast to the damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The first in the world practice Australian law on the same pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same box of glum-olive color with the terrible images of affected parts of the body, and images of children, the health of which undermined smoking their parents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the different images and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, introduced in mandatory with this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The federal government of Australia says that the purpose of this action is to deter young people from smoking, depriving the habit fashion status.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the basis of this decision based on the results of the studies that showed people, not to impose a smoking up to 26 years, 99 times out of 100 never become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"it is clear that even at a young age children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," said Health Minister Tanya plibersec, citing a study by that, for example, the crown in the logo in children is associated with the idea of the princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes will not affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adopting such measures have already seen, and other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold on the cheap and available cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought it was initiated," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco Company in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette and silicone cases, hides unpleasant images on the package, rapidly grew up (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case to the High Court of Australia, where they tried to challenge the law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Sandra ha, Zico has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects the new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, this is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A potential obstacle for the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among precisely that part of the population, the aim of these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Australia after the adoption of a number of laws that makes illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibit vendors displaying cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it cannot limit in this foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"if you sell tobacco and you are left with only this small loophole, the idea is to promote their products on the Internet looks like a very attractive," explains Beca Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, on social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">The question is whether this was the work of the ordinary citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare no effort and time and made the video, or advertising company behind it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Australian unit of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that it was unfair trade restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries are very slim.</seg>
<seg id="26">Decision of the WTO is expected by mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Tanya plibersec, the government has discussed with other countries to adopt similar laws on their packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory posting photos, warning about the hazards of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of a tightening of laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovations.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures of me not touching.</seg>
<seg id="33">I just don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">"just vyhvatyvaesh cigarette and pryachesh pack in his pocket," explains Viktor Al Haig, buys cigarettes with a photograph of cancer of the mouth of the pack.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, the only thing that can make me quit - this is my little daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yiu, head of the store tobacco was King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging complicated task of goods on the shelves</seg>
<seg id="37">"before I on the unloading of the new party left for an hour, and now four hours'," he complains.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the government should have to take and not ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, OK, it's over, closing shop," he says, vskidyvaya hands up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it's not so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because of our aircraft were mechanical problems and he was replaced by another plane, which we and waited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I'm not going to lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - it's really boring, and there is not much help either books, magazines, no iPhone, nor even the duty-free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But in recent years, more and more scientists and experts on child development support in favor of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in certain situations for us and for our children get bored isn't so bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain distracted on interesting related topics that may be conducive to creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because in the modern world we all are constantly before some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Maybe we need to strive to boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes. "</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time, there.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will come back to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I, like many, believed that boredom is a relatively recent invention of times, when people have appeared more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is not so, says Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history of Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book "the fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"in fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls of Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating from the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It remains an open question as to how we understand the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is, "said John D. Eastwood, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Having studied the materials research on this topic and asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but you can't do that would give them the satisfaction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that skuchayuschiy people not doing something that would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">I don't want to do anything the apathy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main in переживаемой boredom, he says, is a "violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time goes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">According to the description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible link between the two conditions, skuchajošiem people see the causes of the problems in the outside world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems that we are bored, when in fact we just find it difficult to focus on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study, "the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues cite conducted earlier experiment, participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants also heard loud noises are not relevant to the case of TV programs included in the next room, others heard these same sounds on low volume, so that they can be almost impossible, and a third group listened only to record a vote without sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard a low-volume, noted that they were bored, most of them - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause weariness, said Mark J. fensk, associate professor of neurology at the University of guelpa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on the line in search of marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is considered, he said, that when people start pokachivatsya on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions not just help relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"research has shown that children who do not prohibit fidget and swing, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require you to sit down," said Professor fensk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In some moments we are all feeling bored: a delayed flight (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching the humdrum film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But different people have different degree propensity to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980s to measure such individual researchers have developed a special "scale of the propensity to boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, "much of what I have to do, monotonous and chant" or "me too much fun, so I don't have enough time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that bored boys more than girls, "said Stephen vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida," in particular with a variety of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, in general, teenagers are often bored.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he contacted via pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said that they were bored in school and while doing homework, and 23 percent said that they were bored outside the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">While only 3 percent of parents said that they were bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson notes that he has no information about what would such data about boredom now, 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he knows that "in adolescence is the peak of the propensity to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully resolve than they do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Let's get back to my original question: boredom useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes no, because in extreme cases it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor vodanovich, devoted to the study of the problem for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"so our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is the boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain doesn't always knows what it is better to do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you will be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.</seg>
<seg id="51">But if you watch TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he will miss, but he did not learn to deal with boredom independently or in any other way to manage their time and employment, "said Professor fensk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"such skills and self-regulation use in a variety of situations," he said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only to occupy themselves something, he also learns to control at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that boredom need to somehow praise.</seg>
<seg id="56">But consider it something bad is not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action, and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agree with this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"we see it so that we need more experience boredom, with boredom is extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">In fact, people tend to disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"in the modern world we are accustomed to the constant over-stimulating the senses," he says, "and when the silence, and we don't know what to do."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">While it is unclear how the new law will apply on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony Orozco, Nineteen-player football team and the student community college in the south-east of the state of Colorado charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be entirely legally throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends had been in Lamar and rode in the car on the Prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came agenda in court for drug possession and possession of a device for drug use is a minor offences, each of which had a fine of $100 dollars - and set the date for the trial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"we are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But the offender whether he?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small-scale prosecutions depends not so much from the law, many from consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Charged with minor offences related to marijuana, has already been charged in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations have already stopped charges to people under the age of 21 years and older for possession of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law comes into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, in the more conservative districts in Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases related to marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to mountainous areas of the West are voting for, to avoid the appearance of their places in the new, licensed by the state of shops selling marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"all of this is growing so fast that I don't even know what to expect further," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also ozadacheno pochesyvayut head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They will formulate rules to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all that needs to be done before December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues of the use of marijuana for medical purposes in the first, and now for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"in Colorado in a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and. Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now, no one can do more, "admits Mr Smith, than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will work.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we have no real precedent, on which we could focus," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and for the whole year, plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when there is no state licensing system, and the right to possession of marijuana has been institutionalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">But there are in fact still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed in this period, for example, how to find a balance between state regulation of "adequate access" to the licensed marijuana with a ban on trade it within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"it will be especially difficult to place the licensed trade in marijuana plants in the inner cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently established research group called the Center for the legalization of marijuana. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21, Aurora police chief Oates of his subordinates sent an e-mail message that the office of the city will no longer attract people who have reached the age of 21 years, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police stops ulichat people in these violations, "from this moment."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal dealers and distributors of drugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Prosecutor Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote on the bill, he said that prosecutors will continue to hold accountable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage the use of its people to undergo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment, the 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"the duty of our institutions - the chase for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr tank in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was controversial even in places such as rural Mesa County, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of small amounts of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="30">District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take charge of the already open matters relating to the storage of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until he won't change is our duty," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55 percent of residents of the state of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported the decision, the inclusion of issues of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">A controversial reaction of residents in different parts of the state revealed ambiguity relations of local authorities to experiment with marijuana in the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"the district prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean makalister to have a lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"they're so long persecuted people for this is that now can't really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington - The United States, in which a small amount of marijuana are treated the same as to alcohol is destined to be experimental field throughout the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Advocates of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Marijuana legalization advocates hope that the Department of Justice to give on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several received wide resonance arrests of traffickers and patients reported using marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government gave the go-ahead in most cases of trafficking of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs are unlikely to be interrupted at home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are hardly likely to turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities in the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on anti-drug in the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores to sell marijuana, and so would not be able to open up earlier than a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, монтроуз, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"we don't want to be in this position that we will issue the license to someone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now we see a contradiction between the results of the local voting and those who voted for the state.</seg>
<seg id="47">Is still a lot of unresolved issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella whiatt: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I'm conservative.</seg>
<seg id="2">The persecution of university students for their views were not today.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world, the institution, the modern-day equivalent of the ancient symposium, zakladyvayuschiy two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet, after two weeks of study on historical faculty woosterskogo College at Oxford University in the late 1980s, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father didn't pass and burst into tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">The friends were are bewildered.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I threw college, because I didn't like that my classmates have sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left, because I had to drink from Shcherbatykh cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In fact, it was not so funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran, because I was systematically hounded and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's not because of my rather unusual name or that I attended a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was hounded for only one reason, and in this renowned cradle просвещенности it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow whiatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a follower of conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You ask, why to reminisce about it now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the latest data, a new generation of students, reinforces that center-right views, is subject to the same kind of harassment.</seg>
<seg id="17">This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of the students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as the one who is disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge claim that their "often actively isolate, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to enter into the committee on equal rights college of additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation is aggravated released recently on BBC Two documentary about politics in the student environment "country wonders: young, smart and right-wing," in which the Conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">The film was shown Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who drives a Rolls-Royces, wears a silver suit and walking stick with a silver nabaldashnikom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In other universities students-conservatives complain that they are "scapegoats because of the higher school fees."</seg>
<seg id="23">Luke black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of conservatives from Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "in a university environment increases skew toward the left.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people who we don't even know in advance believe us arrogant and unpunished unruly children of wealthy parents. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history department at Corpus Christi College, which was filed a petition on strengthening the protection, calls this "neuutist atmosphere" and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of the members of the center-right-wing student club gaining significantly deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, or simply to normal life members of the club," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I came back in September 1986, timid and shy vosemnadtsyatyletneu girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford лихорадило from hatred of the Conservative party.</seg>
<seg id="30">The year before, the University of voting deprived former student of Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even Revolutionnaire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week freshmen, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt what awaited me ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">I still didn't know that teachers not only looked through the fingers on the hunt students-conservatives, but also gladly took part in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The political issues - the miners' strike, the privatization of government and opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through the walls trimmed wood panelling audiences.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first workshop I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century in English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"miss whiatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">The text was me with hard, I hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face, like a cake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"thatcherist fundamentally not teach French or they simply did not have enough brains?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students захихикали.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes were full of tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I advise you to take a few basic lessons of the French in his spare time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," probryuzzhal Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I went back to my room is miserable.</seg>
<seg id="44">That evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, a second-year student at the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of Conservative University.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said in a friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> "unfortunately, it is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">Over every, anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Conservatives, will scoff.</seg>
<seg id="49">I'm very easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the freshmen and conservatives pretend that they Labour. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in a local pub, I timidly trying the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted on the fact that he did not agree with all that says Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trick failed.</seg>
<seg id="54">A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "you are the daughter of a fascist pigs.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are contagious. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students picked up his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was flawed, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"as the Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> "they колотят each other, right?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like it must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the Sixties.</seg>
<seg id="61">Can I ever to live a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or do I have to meet with like-minded only under the cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">Will I be forced labor and hide their true beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="64">Coming to me three years began to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only teacher in my college, has not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">His hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriters.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college, he did not appear.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist-deterministicmu view of history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"here you can't be happy," he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and impartial Metropolitan friends.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.</seg>
<seg id="73">He didn't believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies in the 1940s there were any political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"but it's the best university in the world," he said plaintively.</seg>
<seg id="76"> "there is not capable, not only in the city of dreaming spires....</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friends-Communists always behaved impeccably. "</seg>
<seg id="78">His wet eyes pomutneli.</seg>
<seg id="79">"don't pick up any hasty decisions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure that this is just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">You're разобьешь my heart, no matter if the university. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was crafting regular visits to London and my emotional defense weakened.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a conservative, unable to bear the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The next week at the seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the heart of burning with shame, I admitted that "I was brainwashed brains parents," and called them "old fools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford, was destined to score my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the same time he every week wrote two columns for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I'm not married, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I have not returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me plaksoy and cloth.</seg>
<seg id="94">But in the eighteen years nobody should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.</seg>
<seg id="95">Even sadder, however, that it was the Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers of the Tories, but to this day behind undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hardest job in the world: the miners with kavakh-igena</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The four Euro Indonesian miners risking life and limb, utaskivaya 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on steep trails combined</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom they work - hell, and others literally work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them are the Zaporizhzha Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living in the mines of sulphur-idzhen kavakh Volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every day the Zaporizhzha descends on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens on contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Otkolov huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets on the shoulders and held them up the precipitous rocky road.</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to the top of the volcano, which is the height of 39.411 meters, only 250 meters, but ismozhdenic gruzchik takes more than 40 minutes to climb snail's pace, with Labour holding the balance and carefully nashupyvaya road to not оступиться and not fall off a cliff.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened with one туристкой from France, which fell a few years ago with rocks kavakh-igena.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners with kavakh-igena earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which mined</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once at the top, they pave his way between the tourists who have their photograph, as if they were monkeys from the circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, stride three kilometers to the scales that mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is about 95 Kandy ngrimbi, company, which operates in 1960, the volcano and it is better not to say, of its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industries, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"as the norm is perenoska 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each hodka," explains US antonyms, which usually carries three daily carrying.</seg>
<seg id="14">He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels exhausted, but they allow him to amass 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although it seems mizers for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"podennaya fee miners is very high on the local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains Porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There, his salary was just 75.00 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the plot was not so heavy, but the Zaporizhzha returned with his family in bâniovangi, a small town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same crushing like sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to the Jawa, converted to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Zaporizhzha asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he slezyatsya eyes because of toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In his 27 years antonyms spent three years, risking a kavakh-idzhen, sulfur which has already started to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he slezyatsya eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates a volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it'll for two more years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises a more than acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished with life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a doorman at the hotel, but instead he performs work mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sharing dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur does not cease to flow at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and glitters amid the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadows, Zaporizhzha descends into the crater, covering a small flashlight, podsoedinennym to his Cascais, which he bought for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters to smuggle baskets with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite the high profits, the mining company not mechanized extraction sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment носильщикам who work at their own expense and with such deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, they do not get even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for photographing, who, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with tourists who come to photograph a volcano and his men and mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"this work for cattle, and not for the people," says badrusin, stocky носильщик 42 years, who spent on kavakh-idzhen three decades, ever since I left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">Able to raise up to 110 pounds, he insists that he will accept the job "as long as it can," because he needed money for the education of his three children, aged from 18 to 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulfur burning throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke, emerging from a volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which deformirovalis under the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing basket on his back, unaynik now only can raise 50 kilogram in his 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck carrying on a warehouse in tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the swamps.</seg>
<seg id="35">"don't go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says unaynik, widely opening her mouth, which is missing a few teeth.</seg>
<seg id="36">Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also works as a carrier of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation is one of the most difficult courses in the world: what do human mules with kavakh-igena.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying something like "let's suppose Bao (булку) in the stove," to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to people have done, "its national debt."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the main problem in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are the worst in the world according to reproduce their kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government tried to do much, for example, to launch the spirits with pheromones or organize parties quick singles (blitz-visits).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing of the possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The child 1.2</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who do not take it so lightly, so this is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It spends $1,300 a year on politics for the enthusiasm of the citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The state package for married couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, prolonging pregnancy and maternity leave and provides tax breaks.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has a low efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high-tech state-city in south-east Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national management of the population, is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why Singaporeans do not have more children? "</seg>
<seg id="24">Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the National Office of population, says that the reason that "improved education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"this allowed people to have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and a family," she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms contribute to the growth in the number of Bachelorette and long delays of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to reduce immigration to counter a sharp increase in population, causing outrage among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are Web sites where thrives barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, which he criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The growth of immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that last year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in elections since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the fall in fertility has a certain influence on the economic growth of the nation's tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is making efforts to be built so many small housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments of 46 square meters are sold very well.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, there is a belief that they can contribute holostomu lifestyle and deprive the incentive to developers who want to build a big family housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the company showed El developers, says that their "boxes of shoes" sold much faster than the more spacious copies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result, our cash flow increasing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who earlier put obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Is too perenapryazhennye</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking with singaporians who work in the financial district of the city, it seems that they will not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"people are very stretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people this delay," said a young manager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but for me it's important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mentioned his career, stress and prices for housing and education as factors that hinder them to have children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So, how would the government nor even encourage their citizens to the birth of children, when it comes to childbearing, the final word rests with singaporians.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="42">Porras indicates that Professor Mark prenski, Master of Education from Yale University and the author of the work of digital natives and immigrants who invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives that they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning to themselves," she said.</seg>

<seg id="46">"also they were selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she added.</seg>

<seg id="48">"tell them that they don't do this, useless," she adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you're not told a stranger, so why do you do on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, you would have liked, if published a photo of you like that, that you published about his friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know that others publish about you? "</seg>

<seg id="54">Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online just as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">The rules are the same.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The death rate from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I was like a stunned," he recalls that difficult, despite all the rhythm of the doctor's time.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man hid it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having decided to cope with the disease itself, he wanted to know about it as much as possible, and his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients are HIV-branch hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he came in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He lives with the diagnosis "of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe when there are too few treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he was cut."</seg>
<seg id="9">In other words, in those days have AIDS was the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without worsening the quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when the virus has been damaged, "drained" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of patients who began treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the Department of HIV-positive hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when reports about 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years old," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To assess this progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in халиско 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, argues that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "why is still there are deaths?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "personally, I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I imagine, so the case in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least for the past 12 years, we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because you don't know about his infitirovannom condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He cited the devastating data: "nine out of ten patients come when we already have some opportunisticeskaya infection; what you need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality rate, so it is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who are asked."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In his proposal, agree experts and officials of the State Council on the prevention of AIDS in халиско (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for testing, motivated by the fact that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the most common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some people think that will die, and don't want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"times are still die, the better I'll nadiratsya three times a week," they say. But not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I nourish myself, doing exercises, take drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, take an active sex life, but with a shared responsibility to take care of yourself and of another person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal lives with Milenio Jalisco, to encourage its statement of those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, experiencing fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let checked, if there was a risk of infection, even as soon as possible to know whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other people, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The counter condoms</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Big gap between programs in health and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who started a problem associated with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, dedicated to this task, "actually increased distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, we now offer packages to 100, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"why would they do?" is a popular issue, with echidstvo and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the advocate.</seg>
<seg id="39">I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for the mystery and that hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places that are often visited by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, is distributing condoms under his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="42">"it's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The key data халиско</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">13,435 (12,158 total reported cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state ranks 4th place in the national rankings on new and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13-th on HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92 percent of the infections are related to sexual way, 6 percent through blood and 2% to perinatalism path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, because on the one known case there are four to five people who don't know about it.</seg>

<seg id="5">"I've done a lot of roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at once, as when I was president of BSN, director general of the national team and president of the Federation in the 90-s," recalls Reyes during a visit to his home in the Primera Hora Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"basketball has been my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes was not exaggerating, making this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things gathered for his long way to testify about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The heart Bayamon</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the largest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old, his performances in the role of co-agent or agent contract.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year the debut of Jerome Minsky BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since then, and continue to lead became "kuko" Ortiz, who was a great manager, "said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that, Jean bartov, who arrived here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you, there is a very strong player, rising 6 '7."</seg>
<seg id="16">"do you want?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And it was the beginning of a Minsky, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartov then recommended that the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and has become one of our best scorers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that said that if Minsky brought a championship Bayamon, гаусс helped to win another one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">With the Cowboys championstv Gauss I enjoyed, but at a distance, because in 1988, has been portrayed as the chief of the Federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">By the time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Minsky in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we have got the fourth place and it was supposed to be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The team with the World Cup in 1990, is the best team, what you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite was the one with the plays in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won a bronze at the World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">The team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, FICO Lopez and 'pikulina' (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'tonito' colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'кихоте' Morales, who failed to participate in a 90 year because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The team, which probably wasn't the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us to a gold medal and a great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament of 1995 in неукене, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With role players like 'kanito' nyevsa, Pablo alisea and young Rolando hurruitner instead of players, temporarily estranged for the mess panamericansk championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without any doubt, it was pikulin Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His performance at international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico does not dominate at this level as it did pikulin.</seg>
<seg id="34">And that is without his career in different leagues, in which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best puertoricancem head?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a very difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalma, armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the young, I really like the work Leo arill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What do you need to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and training for managers, officials and judges.</seg>
<seg id="46">It gives me pleasure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Now what are you doing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, icabel, which has always been with me.</seg>

<seg id="1">The course, which examines the "end of the world."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week, students study the apocalyptic phenomena, such as a nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharm decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had irresistible lure: the end of a long "Countdown" the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which many people seized as evidence that heralded the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Sharma had no idea that he was expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddonom," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where the end times Christian theorists believe that will start the apocalypse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I didn't realize that this will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we are left with only 30 days, it was a really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically last in history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In templsk University associate professor Barry Wacker reads the course "media, culture and the end of the world."</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week, students study the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"we analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that offer a hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, could hit the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month, the students analyzed films on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I tried to tell students that maybe, probably, plausible and impossible," said Wacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America and his colleague Matthew Restall Amara солари, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is called simply "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"we do not add '2012' to always be able to read the course again, in case the end of the world will not come," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Despite the "imminent destruction," students should learn to cook projects and take final exams.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse that does not leave students with no choice but to work "to the same night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Courses have proved quite popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"designated ended for two hours," said Restall about its course for students with the highest average scores, which signed 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have received e-mail for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked, are there still places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students, in turn, to assure that this course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"I like to watch that make people to console themselves," said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Department of Sociology of religion and Haddonfield, of New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the image of an apocalyptic thoughts, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or his absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will vecoesa, 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I've never heard about the deal, which would have been taught to this," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">He like me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor - not said that he believes in the doomsday date of December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"our first project touched Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we are his discredited," said Julie zeglen, 21-year-old student last year in templsk University of West Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But he noted that there are apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people react to changes around himself, predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"in other places, people don't think about it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Predominantly in anglogovoryaschem world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knew any well-informed about the "end of the world" there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"the Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the appeal.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon from the pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall pointed out that for a long time about many of the last days of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The students and teachers blithely refer to this date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some said that they are going to go to parties, "the end of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"maybe, call someone from friends to laugh together," said Samir Ford, 20-year-old student at the Faculty of communication.</seg>
