<h1>
<seg id="1">Republic strategy of the resistance to repeated election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of Republicans justified their policy with the need for fight with the falsification on the selections.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in the center of Brennana is considered the latter myth, asserting that the cases of falsification on the elections in the United States are more rare than the cases of death from the impact of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover the lawyers of Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One can be said with the confidence: these new tendencies will have a negative effect on of voter turnouts.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense similar actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada the U.S. states bear responsibility for the organization of federal elections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this very reason the majority of the governments of states since 2009 assume the laws, which complicate the process of registration or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon acquired new scope after the selections in November 2010, which brought 675 new places in 26 states to Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="10">In one 2011 were as a result only accepted 180 bills, which limit voting rights in 41 state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New laws about the selections require voter to present identity card with the photograph and proof of the presence of American citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these laws shorten the period of early voting, they abolish the right of voter registration during the day of command and take away voting rights in citizens, who have convictions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">To the selections of 2006 not one U.S. state forced voters to present identity card with the photograph.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana became the first state, which introduced a similar requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 konstitutsionnost of the law, accepted in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">_republic authority hurry extend this practice, and, on other state.</seg>
<seg id="17">For two last years they initiated the bills, which force voters to present identity cards with the photograph, in 34 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that in contrast to Quebec the American citizens do not have this universal identity card as the card of medical insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., 21 million people, that reached the necessary for the voting age, do not have the identity card with the photograph, given out by the government organ of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this case the cost of obtaining the required identity card frequently exceeds one hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New limitations dispropoptionally affect young people, minorities and people with the low level of incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people, which earn it is less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of citizens it is older than 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with the photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But this yet not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">To students - voters, who, as it is considered, vote for the candidates from the Democrats, in several states it is not permitted to use the identity card with the photograph, given out by their educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">Then the same states permit members of the fishing and hunting clubs, which vote in essence for the Republicans, to use for voting of certification, given out by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004 not one state required the proof of the presence of American citizenship for the voting.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time similar requirement was introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011 more than ten states accepted the laws, which require voters to prove that they are the citizens of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are, obviously, aimed at that in order to limit voting descendants from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is considered that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, republic legislators initiated in 2011 the laws, which abolish voter registration during the day of voting in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also limited the right of the individual persons or groups to render aid by the fact, who desires to be registered.</seg>
<seg id="34">This limitation did not pass without the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the selections of 2004 campaign on voter registration helped to introduce into the lists of approximately 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time the measures, accepted since 2009, led to the drop on 17% of level of the registration of new voters in 2010 on the comparison since 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition republic legislators accepted in other five states the laws, aimed at shortening of the period of early voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, during general election of 2008 in Florida 33% voters, who voted before the appointed time, they were African Americans, although the latter composed only 13% of the total number of voters of state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same occurred also with the descendants from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Presenting only 11% of voters, they composed 24% of citizens, who voted before the appointed time.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast to the white, which, forming 76% of voters, among those voted before the appointed time composed only 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Certainly, legislator-Democrats and their supporters actively speak against the adoption of the laws, which limit voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several projects of laws were vetirovano by governor-Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="44">The action of the most ambiguous laws was stopped with the interference of the Attorney General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This made it possible to partially limit negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of 34 states accepted the laws, which require the presentation of identity card with the photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless, the new rules, which entered the action will undoubtedly hinder the realization of selective right for the selections of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Criticisms from the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws, which were accepted, seeing in them obvious directivity to that in order to influence the election results of 2012 in the key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report of the center of Brennana dated 2011 demonstrates, that the states, which accepted these laws, present 171 of 270 voices necessary voters of the necessary in the board in order to win presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is still too early to assert with the confidence that these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have essential influence on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one is undoubted: these new positions will have a negative effect on of voter turnouts.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense similar actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Screening of cancer of the prostate gland: to pass test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In reality, test to the DOG gives sometimes the erroneous results, lzhenegativnye, and sometimes also lzhepozitivnye, which lead to the useless medical interference.</seg>
<seg id="3">To men, and so unwillingly passing periodic observation and examination, there is from what to begin to doubt still more.</seg>
<seg id="4">To pass test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies, carried out in the United States, were observed the numerous cases of infection among the groups of those investigated; therefore obtained data difficult to interpret and it is difficult to manufacture any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time European, revealed the different level of mortality in those patients, who passed screening, and those, who did not pass it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also showed, after 12-year observation that the probability of appearance metastasis by 30-40% is higher in those, who did not pass screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I would recommend to pass test beginning from 50 years, or with 40, if one of the straight relatives had cancer of prostate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The men of African-American origin are also subjected to the increased risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Key moment is making a correct decision, as soon as cancer it is discovered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cancer can be both the aggressive and sluggish.</seg>
<seg id="13">For patient it is necessary to elucidate the degree of the risk of his cancerous illness, proposing to it possible versions, without the required treatment of cancer of prostate, which does not present danger for the life in the long-term outlook, but making selection, in these cases, in favor active observation of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men, in which is revealed cancer, will not pass the course of treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not present threat for the life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will propose by them active observation, and if disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly more frequent we with the accuracy determine criteria for making of a decision about that, who must or must not pass the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I would recommend the nevertheless passing of test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important also to consult with its doctor in order to determine, necessary or not to pass this test.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In the collaboration with the international association of urology, Movember created the tool, which makes it possible to estimate all pro and con passages of test to the DOG.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (thus far in English, transfer will be accessible soon) can be downloaded with the address: the http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To avoid the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there does not exist miracle-prescription in order to avoid cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In spite of the progress of scientific research, the observance of a healthy way of life remains the best method to decrease the risk of disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is considered that if all people healthily fed and sufficiently they moved, 30% of cases of cancer it would be possible to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="25">“If no one no longer it smoked, this number would grow as the minimum to 50%”, emphasizes Andre Bole, press-secretary the Canadian association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, according to the estimations, 10% of cases of cancer are caused by heredity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian association of cancer the fight with smoking remains priority, in spite of the decrease of a quantity of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is connected with 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is the factor of risk for many others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It brings colossal harm on the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Even today in Quebec are counted 1.5 million smokers”, tells press-secretary in Andre Bole.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging fact: the risk to die of cancer decreases half 10 years after failure of smoking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to given of PENALTIES, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of a disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of the appearance of breast cancer, thick and rectum, gullet, pancreas and womb.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Studies show that the regular physical activity in the course of the entire life protects from cancer large intestine”, they add in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Nourishment</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Association also recommends the limiting of the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the too large numbers it increases the risks of the appearance of cancer of the large intestine.</seg>
<seg id="41">It follows to avoid also sausage articles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of meat via smoking, drying or salting, can lead to the formation of cancerogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">“The latter can damage to the cells of organism and lead to the development of cancer”, they explain in the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years many scientists dealt with a study of the influence of vitamin additives on the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But for the given moment it is not possible to name the results of these studies single-valued.</seg>
<seg id="47">In the opinion of SCC, study of vitamin E give contradictory results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed reduction in the risk of the development of cancer of prostate, then another gave opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the evaluation of influence on the development of cancer of vitamin D also there is no complete clarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">However, Mr. Bole emphasizes that its anxieties and family anamnesis it is important to discuss with the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">“The delivery of analysis does not lead to cancer”.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Higgs's boson in the components</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">By the past summer communication, that for scientists was, possibly, possible to reveal Higgs's boson, caused present stir - and not without reasons.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is considered that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, neither much nor is small.</seg>
<seg id="4">Furthermore, this is the last particle, whose existence was predicted within the framework of the standard model - our best, or, in any case, “least not perfected” of the description of nature and behavior of material, but which earlier could not be revealed experimentally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physics yet not to the end they are assured that the discussion deals precisely with Higgs's boson.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without the shadow of doubt that we deal concerning the actually new particle and that she strongly resembles Higgs's boson, forecast by standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, new given, represented on this week at one important physical congress in Kyoto, it seems, this they confirm, although for the complete confidence yet it does not obtain some data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Let us represent nevertheless that the discussion deals with Higgs's boson, since chances to be mistaken seem minimum, and let us look however, that this it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this peace one law completely inevitable, that says, that two things cannot prove to be in one and the same place simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="10">To go around this rule there is no opportunity whatever, even do not attempt too zealous, you will otherwise do harm to itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although physics of elementary particles is sufficiently strange peace, occurs that in it also there is one law of the similar nature: the exclusion principle of Pauli, who postulates that two particles cannot occupy one and the same space at one and the same moment of time, if they are in one and the same “quantum state” - this “state” consists, briefly, in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the basis of this, physics divide the particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one angle, we find respectable citizens, called fermions, which are wisely subordinated to Pauli's principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">In other fuss the bosons, infamous gang of the anarchists, who do not have respect to nothing - at least for this principle, which means that they can very quietly prove to be in one and the same place simultaneously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As reports the site (by the way, completely unusual) of Particle Adventure of the laboratory of Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the mesons, about which we here speak will not be, and “the particle of the force”, by means of which are extended basic forces of nature and to which in a certain kind relates Higgs's boson.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These bosons themselves, should be emphasized, not all such exotic essences, as it would be possible to think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In reality, if you succeed in reading this chronicle, then this because of one is improbable to the commonplace boson: to photon, or “the particle of light”, which is “the messenger” of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, when one particle, which has electric charge, is accelerated or changes direction, this " disrupts” electromagnetic field in this concrete place, approximately as the stone, been cast into the pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this “disturbance” is born the electromagnetic wave (light, either infrared radiation or ultraviolet, and so forth), and this wave is not than other as photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons “of the carriers of force”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same occurs with the boson of Higgs, with the only difference, that, so that this boson would appear, must be “disrupted” another field, field of Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, Higgs's field considerably, is considerably more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order it to excite, it is necessary to acquire very and very high energy, as if the discussion dealt with the frozen pond, whose surface it could oscillate only very large stone.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why is necessary enormous particle accelerator as that, which is exploited in CERN - large hadron collider, which is ring with a diameter of 27 km! - for achievement such enormous energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful also for explaining the relationship between the boson of Higgs and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In reality, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, as, for instance, magnets, interact, others - no: the sheet of paper, for example, never itself will be held on the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">In exactly the same manner, not all particles interact with Higgs's field: those, which interact, have a mass, whereas others (as photon, by the way) it they do not have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So that however, “can bring” all these studies, does ask the Mrs. of Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">In the science they are used for testing the correctness of standard model (S), and this also makes possible for physicists to grope the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts SEE.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of them passionately thirst moreover so that this divergence would be revealed, t to least nonconformity can open door for “new physics” and plug some holes of model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The latter, it is necessary to say, it still has essential deficiencies, proposing no explanation for gravity (oy!) or for the dark material, which forms approximately 80% of universe (oy-oy!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But thus far in CERN such divergences they did not find.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Benefit from these studies for the daily life of mean statistical person to predict more difficultly, but would be error assume that it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="35">You look: at the very beginning the 60's the pioneers of the studies of laser in Bell's laboratories could not even assume, what revolution their works will cause.</seg>
<seg id="36">They foresaw their applications in the science, but not and what is more.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, already deceased physicist Uillard Boyle, which worked in Bell's laboratories, where was in 1960 invented the laser, and which itself developed the first continuous-wave laser (previous they were pulse) in 1962; he indicated that initially the laser was considered faster as “laboratory gadget”.</seg>
<seg id="38">Represent…</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And furthermore, application can be located for the set of instruments, which accompanies a study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during its optical studies in 1969 developed the small sensor of light.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, although this was not completely by its initial destination, now serves “as eye” for all digital cameras of peace and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics of 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">This, certainly, it does not mean that the work of large hadron collider will necessarily change our life, but this only shows, in reality that everything can be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative aid - best method to die… | “Debt”</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">In the commission for worthy death in Quebec the delicate ground of the end of the life recently was discussed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Debates soon must be renewed, and bill at this time is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless in this area of importance much still is to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">“Debt” attempted to look more closely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A total of several weeks ago Mr. L. Eshche lived one in his apartment in Monterezhi.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cancer of prostate, which destroyed it from within, gave to it postponement for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">“To me they gave five years, I lived seven”, he says, between life and death, lying at the bed in the shelter of palliative withdrawal Victor-Gadbua in become white, where it arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">“But this always shock, for this it cannot be been prepared”, he, says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Disease makes its work: the improbable weakness, which does not give independently to walk into the toilet and even independently to feed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at the table, on which stands appetizing dinner, it is surrendered and agrees so that it they would help to assume the food.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is stimulated, even it teaches to smile, to talk with the unknown people, which work around it, they bring to it medicines, Veduta of it into the bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage before usual death.</seg>
<seg id="14">“My largest desire so that they would cure me from diarrhea, this is humiliating”, it acknowledges.</seg>
<seg id="15">Several hours after the personnel found medicine for this ailment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“In the course of the life us they teach that the man must be moistened costing”, says Pierre Broder, psychologist in the shelter of Victor-Gadbua.</seg>
<seg id="17">To regress to the state of child - for some intolerable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“Everything depends on the ability of man” to be subdued to the decline, it asserts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since, in the opinion of many people, which carry out palliative withdrawal, outstanding events sluchayayutsya also at the very height of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients, who enter palliative shelter Victor-Gadbua, everything are sick with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts remove to them maximum three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this stage, the command of doctors and nurses does not allow more than the aid, called “therapeutic”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Mrs. a., 89 years, most of all fears to die “in the consciousness of the suffocation”.</seg>
<seg id="24">But disease allowed me to learn her children.</seg>
<seg id="25">“I have good children”, it adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">“I greater than nothing want in the life”, she says before permitting placing to it the mask, which facilitates respiration.</seg>
<seg id="27">It as before waits within the next few days the last visit of its son, which arrived from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the shelter Victor-Gadbua with the aid of the group of volunteers they allow maintenance of body and aid with the nourishment.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is the palliative withdrawal, which remains, when more than anything it cannot be made.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to make death of more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec for each of 11 700 inhabitants one place in the establishments of palliative aid is fallen.</seg>
<seg id="32">This it is very small, taking into account that sooner or later we all will die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life continues under the best conditions, such as are possible, explains doctor Christian Martel - one of the doctors of shelter.</seg>
<seg id="34">Be it comfort is physical, is emotional or is sincere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Dying we will agree to grant oral garglings from the brandy or Pepsi, looking that it will request.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics we no longer force to control the level of sugar.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is the part of the daily activity.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last evening we brought beer to Mr. x., who died today at night.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the morning its son finished drinking this beer in the feet in deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">“We help close ones, just as to patients”, tells Natalie Savart, director for the care of patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the shelter Victor-Gadbua not one day is similar to previous.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to the 93--year old man, who delights in by his last encounter with the family in the court, after being arranged on his pillows during the toast in its honor, tragically dies the young person of 36 years, surrounded by parents, by wife even by two small children and pereprobovashiy all, in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">“Into the latter half a year from three to five cots, it is always occupied with cancerous patients at the age to 45 years”, ozabochenno speaks doctor Christian Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients, taken into the shelter Victor-Gadbua, arrive from the house, and 47% of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to the palliative withdrawal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is considered that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to the palliative withdrawal, i.e., to the withdrawal, which is allowed in order to relieve sufferings of patients, which entered the final stage of their life, be it at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some establishments, such as shelter Victor-Gadbua and society of the palliative withdrawal at home of large Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancerous patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Specifically, this large gap in the system of public health of Quebec forces many doctors - specialists for the palliative withdrawal to fear the adoption of law, which legalizes euthanasia and aid in the suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October circulates the manifesto, signed by heavenly bodies in the region of palliative withdrawal, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and by doctor Bernard Lyapuantom and testifying about their disagreement with a similar initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to doctor Christian Martel, the system of public health of Quebec is insufficiently effective in order to ensure right to the palliative withdrawal of high quality before passage to euthanasia will be permitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I saw the patient, who conducted 14 days in the department of first aid, in the terrible pains, and no one took the necessary measures in order to facilitate them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear, that the patients desire to die only because they do not obtain adequate withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists to the last day try to save patients, in spite of the pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard were already minimum, when it ended the harassing chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I reported to my oncologist that I cease treatment, it answered me, which will regret, that I cease fight, she says.</seg>
<seg id="56">In this case she me itself told that my days were considered!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">There is no omnipotent withdrawal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Doctor Martel considers that 90% of patients, who request about death, thank medical staff, for the fact that they did not carry out their request after command for the palliative withdrawal facilitates their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However, it is necessary to note that the palliative withdrawal is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to Elsi of Monroe, director for the palliative withdrawal in the society of the palliative withdrawal at home of large Montreal, the patients are not receptive to the anesthetization in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">In the very end of the life the doctors frequently come running to palliative sedatsii, with which the patient will sleep to the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">It cannot be more been shut that we do not know about these sufferings.</seg>
<seg id="63">Increasingly are more frequent and more frequent patients, by which does not succeed in facilitating the pain, they can have a access to palliative sedatsii.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients, who suffer from the pain, always speak one and the same phrase: “I want to die”.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this necessarily does not indicate “I I want, so that to me would be conducted euthanasia”, this indicates “I I want, so that i would become more easily”.</seg>

<seg id="1">Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Officials, responsible for the building of roads, construction contractors, collectors of the means of political parties and specialists in the Italian Mafia day after the day tell that the fact that they know about the colossal “system”, which enmeshes construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade-union workers and mafia.</seg>
<seg id="3">“The industry”, which very dearly managed to the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“It is interesting, as is scattered this system after all means were started to the matter, jokes Jacques Dyusheno, deputy and the former Police Chief of Montreal”.</seg>
<seg id="5">Specifically, because of it in 2011 broke out scandal as the side-line result of the investigation of the criminal offenses, connected with the roadbuilding contracts in Quebec, on which the Prime Minister of that time from liberals, Jean Share, agreed very unwillingly.</seg>
<seg id="6">“The report to the Duchesnes” established the direct connection between the industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, one ministry alone of transport would preserve billions of dollars on the contracts”, if some held in control its instincts to take portion.</seg>
<seg id="8">Commission Sharbonno “already displaced two mayors”, it adds, hoping that it will succeed in “revealing the diagrams, which stand after the individual personalities”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Constant subdivision on the struggle against corruption, created in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To the matter was connected the created in 2011 constant subdivision on the struggle against corruption, into composition of which entered the extensive staff of government auditors, inspectors and analysts.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, furthermore, the colleagues of the special subdivision “hammer”, which after 2009 forced “sewage cartel” of Montreal, to end overstating the cost of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a period of recent weeks was produced a series of searches, and to some municipal officials, in particular to Frank Zampino and to Richard Markott - mayor of small town, charges in swindle and corruption were produced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the turn - Zhil Vayyankur, recently retired from mayor Laval's post, the third in the value of the city of province Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">They suspect it of repeated obtaining of bribes during the arrangement of state orders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Furthermore, official charge was produced for several engineers of the service of the communications of Montreal and for construction contractors of Italian origin, including by Tony Akkurso and Lina Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter exploded present bomb, after telling to consequence about “the system” of obtaining state contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">For several years Zambito returned 3% of the cost of the contracts, concluded in Montreal, to a certain mediator, connected with the Mafia, who, in turn, transferred the money of the party of mayor Zherald by Tremblay “united Montreal”.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2000-X years Zambito it littered by money right and left. It transferred more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 Euros) to different parties of province, in essence to liberals, who were being located then in authority.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, it acknowledged that illegally were gathered the means for the former Deputy Prime-Minister from the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The sewerage contracts, in which they overstated the cost</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal “system” of corruption it worked smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="22">Zhil Syurprenan, which was engineer on the civil building, in detail described it before the commission: in ten years he obtained from the construction firms of gifts, invitations into the trips, to the tournaments on the golf, into the restaurants, to the matches on the hockey also of bribes on the whole to 736 000 dollars in exchange for the sewerage contracts, whose cost he overstated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials, responsible for the building of roads, acknowledged that they obtained to the paw, overstating calculations to 30-40% with the aid of the false additions.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then one organizer of the party of mayor, Martan Dyumon, accused Mr. Tremblay of the fact that he intentionally shut eyes to existence of the parallel budget, which filled party cashboxes by dirty money.</seg>
<seg id="25">After these revelations Mr. Tremblay retired at the beginning of November, after immersing Montreal into the deep crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Shantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, who sounded alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">The mayor of region River-de-Preri to the east of island, it resists since 2010 sale of the municipal section, purchased for 5 million dollars and resold after… 1.6 million housebuilders at the height of construction boom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of dirty money in the pre-election campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">She indicates that in the investigation, which will be in the final analysis begun, it “will stretch for the small filament, which makes it possible to understand the functioning of system, kishashchuyu by ants in order to stop gangrene and to determine the guilty”.</seg>
<seg id="30">This process it kharakterezuet as “painful, but positive”.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are situated in the process of cleaning wound, but its own investigation group and observer will be necessary for Montreal, in order to avoid the return of doubtful practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="32">As we are removed house.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is regular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Dyusheno notes from his side that “the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but especially it disturbs the role “elective officials, who knew about this diagram”, but not participated in the machinations.</seg>
<seg id="35">Taking into account that the share of dirty money in financing of election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, it jokes: “To me they said that this was altogetherthe only pale reflection of reality”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec proposes to limit to 100 dollars of donation to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: “Thus far we will not strictly limit elective expenditures, in the policy there be dirty money”.</seg>
<seg id="37">It requires the complete readjustment of assignment system of state contracts and of financing of the parties: “We cannot descend below; boldly vniknuv in are things, we will be able to construct house on the more stable foundation, with the best control and legality”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this history throws shadow to the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno calls those, who laugh, to glance into his own court…</seg>

<seg id="1">“PSZH - not FC [Financial Corporation] Barcelona!”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you in PSZH attained unusual spread.</seg>
<seg id="3">How you will explain this increase?</seg>
<seg id="4">This can be explained by individual consciousness, but can - and by new measurement PSZH.</seg>
<seg id="5">Profits are great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next to them I to time of ripening each day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Operating personnel much also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors force me to daily raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during the match, this is simpler.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the football everything occurs very rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not made burning hot.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the very beginning in the center of preliminary preparation in NIF in Klerfontene and to my arrival in Saint-Steven I always stepped forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you benefit from the competition, established by Porta Anchelotti…</seg>
<seg id="14">To completion of this summer not into the novelty to play the matches of very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know also that each training is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the fact that this player as I, thirsts to be at the level and to be laid out on the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, Porta Anchelotti lends support in my positioning.</seg>
<seg id="18">It help such deputies, as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position, as i.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">To anchelotti - master of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Certainly.</seg>
<seg id="21">To anchelotti suggests respect to entire operating personnel.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in the first league to it there are no equal and it enters into the number of best trainers of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">In it extensive experience, and it won numerous titles with the high-end clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">It worked with the great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think, he will bring new titles to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January in me with it was the encouraging conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I moved away from an entire series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence, which it me renders; are also explained my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What you do think about the first part of the season PSZH?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first league Lyon took away the place of leader.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we as before at call.</seg>
<seg id="32">The League of Champions is one of our basic purposes: we effectively were qualified into one eighth of finale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Which the purpose of club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to pass how further as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on everything can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say our word face to face with the very good European commands.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto in order to have the capability to accept reciprocal match in one eighth of finale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Will be able PSZH to become first-class European club in the short term future?</seg>
<seg id="39">It for this already has a budget…</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become large European club, to Paris it is necessary to win titles and to fasten positions to the long-term outlook.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today this is not so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financial in PSZH is means in order to make this project real.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not to take title in the first league as in the past season, it will be large failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Certainly, this would be large disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">In this year we real hotly desire to obtain this champion title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the past season we were to this close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, there was disappointment, because we have everything in order to arrive at the finish first.</seg>
<seg id="48">This was very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points assume series title.</seg>
<seg id="51">But another command, Monpele, played an even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this year, I think, everything will be in the order.</seg>
<seg id="53">In spite of the fact that such strong commands, as Marseille, Lyon entered into the fight for the title and Bordo, I think that we have forces in order to defeat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do not think you that the media outlets do wait too much from PSZH?</seg>
<seg id="55">This is normal, that from us they expect much, taking into account, was how much inserted and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We completely for this are ready.</seg>
<seg id="57">From the other side, when we house win 4-0 against Trua and us nevertheless find for which to criticize severely, certainly, this a little disturbs.</seg>
<seg id="58">We ask the question, what people first of all wait from us.</seg>
<seg id="59">We never will be able to win each output with the score 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We not FC [Financial Corporation] Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We attempt to introduce the project of game.</seg>
<seg id="62">Command is formed in the course of time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We proved in the League of Champions that we can answer the contemporary calls.</seg>
<seg id="64">You will look on Manchester United, for whom already two seasons do not succeed in passing into one eighth of finale, although they also spent enormous money!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Taking into account the inserted sums, we introduced you in 15 points in front already to the winter interruption.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would be neglect to our opponents and to the championship of France.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, which were not at a height of the past season, were “waked” by this new PSZH.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows, to what extent the first league is captivating.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that in May we will be able to smile and to say to ourselves that, in spite of all difficulties, as a result we defeated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">PSZH, seems, completely depends on the exploits of Zlatana Ibragimovicha.</seg>
<seg id="71">Well and that, if they indicate that there is certain “Zlatanozavisimost”.</seg>
<seg id="72">This only means that Ibragimovich is very successful and that it drives in many heads.</seg>
<seg id="73">It arrived for this and it proves, that it is the star of the first league.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where it played, it showed that he is great player and the star of world scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the group we of it respect as man and as player.</seg>
<seg id="76">It also respects people, which surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">That that it made, this is actually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="78">This it stimulates and others to improve its game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Tyago Silva, which is one of the best defenders in the world, it also justifies all to advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How you did survive Euro-2012 from team France?</seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I hotly desired to participate in this Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching a little play time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there many things, and I left from there more strongly.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today me succeeds in playing good elimination matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This that, on what I hoped from the moment of my baptism in dark-blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We extracted lessons from the fact that happened in the Ukraine, and now they must behave exemplarily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What you do think about the first months of Didier Deshama in the chapter of dark-blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They for it are successful.</seg>
<seg id="90">It has good positions in the elimination group to the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="91">It a strict trainer, it is close with the players and inspires to the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Loran Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I did not want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euros.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier to Desham will bring dark-blue into Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Good deserved no one's (1-1), pulled out on October 16 in Spain - this is the basic match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gave to us the faith in itself.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each battled for all.</seg>
<seg id="99">To this shock in Spain, in my career there were no similar matches.</seg>

<seg id="1">To pay and to sell without the aid of banks - from Bitcoin</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Complete opposition to the current money exchange, based on the central banks, numbered transactions between the obtaining sides c with the commissions for their working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, as frequently it occurs with these technologies, the obviously political vision: persuasion, that the current currency system, which consists of the bank monopolies, leads to the financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In reality, Bitcoin, invented Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is simultaneously the virtual currency (but converted into the dollars, Euro…) and by the protected protocol of exchange according to the type of BitTorrent, which permits implementation of the exchange of the files between participants in one level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200 000 operations were already registered from 15 000 computers in the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand sites assume bitkoyny for the realization of donations or as the pay means.</seg>
<seg id="7">The course of bitkoyna, dostignuv of maximum into 30 dollars (23 Euros) in June 2011; five months later fell to 2 dollars before return today approximately to ten dollars (courses they were indicated on the site bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing special in the comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB (European Central Bank)) in its report about the virtual currency, published in October, interested itself in this system.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes bitkoyn as “most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or Euro” and “similar to the usual currencies”.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as “credits” utilized for the advance in the video game, which are earned in the process of game or which it is possible to purchase (but sometimes and to exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network of Facebook also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the operations of exchange are always controlled and is processed any central organ.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Bitkoyn all nodes of network are simultaneously the holders of the accounting book, auditors, issuers of currency, pokupatelymi and by salesmen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does function this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users in reality occurs between two electronic addresses, similar to electronic mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only for each new payment user can select another address, ensuring thus anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The collection of the information, which relates to this transaction, signs electronically, with the use of a system of coding with the dual key.</seg>
<seg id="19">Network can also verify the authenticity of transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Because of the contents of file, possible to verify that bitkoyny, used in the transaction, actually there exist in the public calculating book, sent out throughout entire network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The registration of new transaction in this book is key stage.</seg>
<seg id="22">It penetrates the solution of the mathematical problem, sent out to computers, that solved which, as if the temporary Central Bank, obtains privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">The discussion deals with the phase of hashing file, i.e., the conversion of large file into the digital signature, short and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers " take” new transaction and add by it number before “to hash” everything together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Purpose lies in the fact that to find the number, which will give the unique digital signature (many zero at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number it is found, they easily check other units, that it is correct.</seg>
<seg id="27">Transaction thus occurs nerarzryvno of that connected with the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If user it is very rapid for the purpose of fraud (less than in ten minutes) it would wish to pay two times some and theme whereas by money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by network - and another would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, which solved task, obtains 50 bitkoynov.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to avoid inflation, reward is regularly divided in half, probably, prior to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of bitkoynov in the rotation therefore is limited by 21 millions, but they are divided to one hundred-million, which leaves another reserve…</seg>
<seg id="32">The complexity of task also grows with an increase in the computational power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of network already survived ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The sites, which render the services of Bitcoin, were subjected attack, and bitkoyny were stolen from the reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">“The used defect does not concern protocol itself”, it certifies Pierre Nuaza, who recently neglected Paymium - company achieving payments by real money with the use of a network of Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB (European Central Bank) reported also about the opportunity of money laundering through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But available money also possess this deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="38">Important players, such as Wikipedia, reject to assume the donations of this type.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the blog-platform of WordPress, them solve.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently Ady Shamir Dorit Ron from the institute of Veytsmana to Israel, they analyzed the calculating book and revealed that almost 80% of bitkoynov are not in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="41">“Gigantic sales” were declared in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">“Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged”, is glad ion It kholmkvist, that works in Coinabul, which is occupied by the conversion of bitkoynov into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Nuaz, another author of benefit on this currency, solidly believes in the potential of this technology as the operating network.</seg>
<seg id="44">Its system, Paytunia, are the equivalent of credit card (in the present money) or noncontact payment through the cell phone, but she uses Bitcoin for checking the transactions, which thus leaves more cheaply.</seg>
<seg id="45">Possessor better controls his personal data and it can thus be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">System is simple in the realization for the owners, for which it is not necessary to establish new devices or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">It suffices to only report the address, which can be “photographed and recognized” by telephone, refines Pierre Nuaza, certifying, that it has already thousand users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general tendency of the revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="49">“Before Bitcoin it will be affirmed, will pass a certain time, but 2013 can become turning point”, it predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The ECB (European Central Bank) in its report intends, by the way, to reexamine the diverse risks, which are considered as the today increased, in the case of the success of this system.</seg>

<seg id="5">For the Afghan army came the time to return to itself control over its territory, while for the Afghans to select its future, without hoping only on us.</seg>
<seg id="6">From us the Afghan peasants, whom we considered as terrorists, suffered in essence.</seg>
<seg id="7">And we themselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and by injured and crippled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, the former commanders, who are hidden in Pakistan, but also frequently from the peasants, who reject the presence of foreign army as this was in the USSR.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even to them are joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id="10">They suffer them, local rebels sometimes help them, but them more it will not be, as soon as West it will begin to behave more delicately.</seg>
<seg id="11">The withdrawal of the French troops from the base of Nidzhrab, which I observed from the height of the hills of those planted by almond trees because of the French credits, he passed to order.</seg>

<seg id="14">Circumstances varied with times of their insurmountable advance from 1994 until 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was empty at that time, the country was in the fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.</seg>
<seg id="16">Taking by them under the control of the country then was received as its kind release, return to the safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women paid for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which them Al-Qaeda exceeded, but their position was not improved also during our days.</seg>
<seg id="18">The former Mujahadeen, Afghan government and current Taliban are united in their desire to retain women in the subordinate position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The basic characters of anti-Soviet war returned to the authority in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They became deltsov, which grip the state earth in order to resell them under the building to repatriates, who returned themselves from Iran and Pakistan, using the enormous American contracts of sub-contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are discredited; majority of them, by the way, even themselves did not war.</seg>
<seg id="22">People, as I heard in the rural locality, want the government, which would consist not of the thieves.</seg>

<seg id="28">It is necessary to ensure with the jobs of these young people, which will want to return neither to the obscurantism of old parties nor to corruption of some leaders.</seg>

<seg id="30">The army exists at the present moment.</seg>
<seg id="31">The authorities, which will it command, they will be considered legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">Old commanders, a anti-Soviet struggle, already take measures for the restoration of the provincial guards, which were not subordinated to central authority.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, mountain country, with the strong local differences, must be to the certain degree decentralized, on the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it into the centralized state with the strong presidential authority, removing the post of the Prime Minister, who existed from the times of the constitution of 1964.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular before the selections, outlined in April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country, beginning from the 50th years, and even is earlier, it depends on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">Industry was not set to the feet, not one weir functions, not one irrigational system is repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; nothing it is produced, except vegetables and fruits.</seg>
<seg id="38">Priority is returned to particular initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the country, destroyed thirty times for years of war, the government control over the infrastructure would be necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Rumors walked, that Afghanistan possesses enormous mineral riches.</seg>
<seg id="41">This only strengthened sensation, that the Western countries were present there, only in order them to take possession of.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy for processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, without the means of transport in order to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of minerals.</seg>
<seg id="43">Chinese already almost left the layer of copper mo. of Aynak, after leaving to international archaeologists (by financed World Bank) to dig out enormous buddistskiy complex and to remain the quite important employers of province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is necessary also that during one excellent day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to the high degree depend the import and export, would restore normal relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The conclusion of French combat subdivisions was completed on November 20.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new cooperation deal provides for the retention of the traditional aid: face for the girls, for the boys, the department of French at the university, French institute, collaboration in the military, juridical, medical and agricultural spheres, support to archaelogical delegation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009 in the tendency “to conquer hearts and minds” and to accomplish the impossible task of the combination of aid with the offensive operations, the service “military--civil activity” with the Defense Ministry (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with the small French public organization, contributed to numerous social activities and activity, directed on the restoration of agriculture in tens of mountain settlements.</seg>
<seg id="48">These works, with the intensive attraction of local labor force, could help to hold in control the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, the restoration of scaffolding, fruit trees, the protection of soils and an increase in the area of the arable earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">What we will leave to the memory about ourselves, after spending two billion Euro on defense expenditure?</seg>
<seg id="50">Much modest budget would assist to an improvement in the conditions of life of the local population, very severe in these valleys, situated often on the height more than 2 000 meters above sea level.</seg>
<seg id="51">Embassy obtained tens of written requests about the realization of the small agricultural works, which emanate from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.</seg>
<seg id="52">In order to get rid of the uprisings, directed by foreign groups, what desire farmers, as they told me, it is necessary to lend them small nonmilitary support, which was controlled well and would enter to them directly.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Heavy kinds of the constitution of Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This is the new risky step of the President of Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than sometimes, regarding the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives to it extraordinary authorities, it decided to play stake everything.</seg>
<seg id="4">The gates of all unaware, it declared on Wednesday, that the constitutive meeting will vote on the final text next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rovno week ago the Head of State granted to meeting two additional months in order to finish work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon already two years, as Egypt it rests on the preliminary text, in which several times were introduced correction, which weakens institutional stability and leads to the juridical contradictions.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only strengthened the separation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the opinion of its opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic to delirium”, continuing “to disrupt this word” and “to trample right”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of its followers they are assured that this is the method to put an end to institutional and political crisis, after accelerating transient process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Referendum must be carried out during fifteen days.</seg>
<seg id="11">The very short time, which forces brothers to forego the intention to explain to Egyptians text, article after the article.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the President this also the method to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction rages in the entire country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohammed Morsi, seems, it is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in one interview for American weekly time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fact more that call to the accelerated voting resembles the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I leave to itself the extraordinary authorities”, which, as it is assumed, must be completed after the adoption of constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of constitutive meeting, for the most part the Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of liberals did not respond to the call.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, not long before the constitutional declaration, they flapped by door, feeling themselves unable to report its opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">The representatives of the human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society made the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">So that the necessary quorum would be achieved, 11 people, spare participants, they were in a hurry added yesterday in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that in the majority of the cases of article they were voted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators, by the way, amused the fact that one of a few differences of day arose all around… time for the prayer, since some committee members calculated, that the hours of constitutive meeting were incorrectly disposed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, on which yesterday still occurred the voting, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The object of universal attention, article 2 in the final analysis remained identical to article from constitution of 1971, which says, that “the principles of Sharia are basic source of law”.</seg>
<seg id="25">Salafistskie parties, for which the introduction of Islamic right is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace “principles” by “the rules”, which would afford the opportunity of their stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists the fact that this article was not changed, is evidence of their good will and respect for other participants in the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Hypocrisy”, answer the liberals, who see in this only PR.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of constitution occurs through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They indicate in particular article 220, which grants to university al-Azkhar consultative role, in particular, in the fact that checking the correspondence of Shariat Law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the specialist through Egypt of Sophie Pome, this causes anxiety, t k “people, called to make decisions, are not selected and have no democratic legitimacy”.</seg>
<seg id="31">We can observe the origin of theocracy”.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many liberals, furthermore, they are disturbed by the fact that the following rector of this university is, it seems, will be far less moderated than current.</seg>
<seg id="33">“At the present moment there is no concrete religious interference.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we remain within the framework of the civil right.</seg>
<seg id="35">The majorities of the lawyers, who worked at this text, this not Ulama, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system” - calms Alexis Bloe, who prepares thesis on the Egyptian constitutional passage.</seg>
<seg id="36">But it recognizes that “around article 220 can arise the ambiguity, since terms the used in it are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This relates in particular k “Fiqh” [Islamic jurisprudence, editor's notes].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future a question can arise, how civil a judges are competent in order to decide on this”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Besides its religious aspect, the text, accepted yesterday, undergoes criticism, since it gives wide authorities to the President of republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood assert that they considerably were reduced in comparison with the fact, what were with the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another questionable moment: the authority of army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of servicemen, the examination of defense budget will pass not to parliament, but in the National Council of defense.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also will not be forbidden the court above the citizens in the military courts, in spite of the requests of associations on the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also expressed the apprehension apropos of the text, which they consider disastrous for the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Is preserved responsibility for blasphemy, and is from now on forbidden insult, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Furthermore, none of the articles no longer speaks about the protection of woman, emphasizes Kheba Moraef, from Khyuman Rayts Votch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the prohibition of tortures in article 36 appears only positive moment.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word, which did not appear in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President had to appear last evening on the television, demonstrations were planned today in the second-half of day.</seg>
<seg id="50">The supporters of the Head of State will, in turn, leave to the streets on Saturday.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">“Great and powerful” to Moscow will bring: migrants will accumulate money into the language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Thus far deputies and human rights activists argue, which will give law about the required lingual testing, in the country already appeared the swindlers, who trade “fake” certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Yearly 13 million guest workers arrive into Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Larger partly these are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their sole purpose - to earn money for maintaining the families, which remained themselves on the native land.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since December 1 came into force the law, according to which each working migrant obligated will be pass examination to the knowledge of Russian.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus far this rule acts only for those, who are intended to work in the sphere of maintenance, housing and utilities economy, way of life and retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, in the course of time, they promise in FMS, tests will become required for all visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides to pass it is necessary not only language, but also Russian history, and the basis of legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Language proficiency it is necessary to confirm both for obtaining and for the prolongation of permission to the work.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exception acts only for the citizens of those countries, where the Russian is official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Do not fall under for the action of law and people, which had time to obtain certificates and diplomas about the formation before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Benefit, predestination and the protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The network of examination points will work under the aegis of the institute of Russian of the name of Pushkin, Universitet the friendship of peoples, MGU, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian VUZ (Institute of Higher Education).</seg>
<seg id="15">Migrants can return tests in all cities; even now in Russia were opened more than 160 such centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Initiative about the introduction of testing supported Deputies of the Gosduma, and FMS.</seg>
<seg id="17">But here are human rights activists before law it came into force, many times had time to pose the question in the press: and that this, strictly, it will give?</seg>
<seg id="18">What will change the obligation of language proficiency both for the Russians and for visitors themselves?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">First of all, - answer the representatives of migratory service, this will make it possible to reduce a quantity of people, which suffer from “working slavery”.</seg>
<seg id="20">Very many speak now about the protection of the rights of working migrants, explains the leader of the representation FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.</seg>
<seg id="21">The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only system of the organized collection will make it possible to 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems appear in migrants without the profession, formation, not knowing language, not having physical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Without understanding of language, it is confident Sebelev, future migrant is doomed to encounter the unconscientious people, which under the guise aid will insert to it “pass” into the terrible close barracks, where it even tens to it of the similar will be by months wearied without the food and documents, poking on 12-14 hours in a 24 hour period.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We obtain many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">“On the native land to them they promise one, but on their arrival they deceive, select passports, do not pay out the promised wage”, confirms the chief for the main administration of the working migration ms of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not be scolded, nasyalnika!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, until many citizens of Central-Asian republics, who are gathered to the earnings into Russia, acknowledge that not only they do not know the language of the country, into which they strive, but also to own-that they write with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course this not so much their wine, as the trouble: a few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to obtain even intelligent elementary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Indeed in their families with something even to feed children, without speaking already about properly dressing them, putting on shoes and equipping into the school.</seg>
<seg id="31">Growing to the teenage period, whereas such children with the first opportunity leave for the earnings.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is difficult, if it is bad with the language proficiency, they, acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="33">“You feel itself humbled and defective”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">True, with respect to law about the language the human rights activists note one crucial point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Testing will be carried out only for those migrants, who have legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">But if there is no status - it will be neither examination nor the subsequent official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile they as before live the large part of the guest workers in Russia illegally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">“Good to grant, or by strangers entrance is prohibited”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many of the visitors assert that to obtain official status in our country not so is simple.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reason - in the bureaucratic obstacles and all the same lingual difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover, the legalization costs the money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">But here false registration can be made rapidly and in all for one-and-a-half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The colleagues of the Russian police know that in essence false documents, there is no registration, hence and the cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">“Request hundred, two to the cigarettes, tea”, shared with journalists the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“Fly, not skupis, buy painting”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, during the first day of the coming into force of law about the language it was explained that false are not only the migrantskie documents about the registration.</seg>
<seg id="47">Several “fake” certificates about the passage of lingual tests are already withdrawn by the colleagues of FMS.</seg>
<seg id="48">False paper are printed on the usual colored printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">They of course were reached to new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, who were hoping themselves thus to facilitate to itself the task of the passage of tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This into two and the more of times is more expensive than the procedure of the official testing: it will manage to working migrant into three thousands.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">By MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) does not take into the revolution the illegal market for the weapon</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The portion of crimes with the application of a legal weapon is extremely small</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) of Russia proposes to stiffen law in the attitude of the owners of civil weapon.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the reaction of authorities to the recent incidents: To harvest shots on the weddings, when it managed without the victims, and the slaughter, arranged by Moscow lawyer Dmitriy Vinogradov, as a result of which to harvest died seven people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Policemen want to forbid the carrying of travmatiki in the public places and to increase the age, from which it is possible to obtain license for weapon - from 18 years up to 21 year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Idea supported the head of Duma security committee and opposition to corruption Irina Yarovaya and it promised, that the corrections into the law about the weapon will introduce into the State Duma in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Not all are contented by the fact that the Russian authorities attempt to fight with the problem via “the twisting of nuts”.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the network appeared the open letter, whose authors - the representatives of different public rifle organizations - require to forego “senseless stiffening”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapon is minimal, stated to the BBC Russian Service lawyer-criminalist Vasiliy Lesnikov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs), in six months of 2012 are perfected 142 crimes with the application of a firearms, registered in the organs of internal affairs, whereas in all within the same period are fixed 1168,000 crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are assured that the stiffening of the legislation in the sphere of civil weapon does not place to criminal to go in “black” market.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, according to them, in Moscow it is possible to find any weapon from the low price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) they meanwhile assert that the situation with the propagation of illegal weapon is controlled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: from the plants to the officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">“Black” market for weapon is supplemented along several channels.</seg>
<seg id="16">Such basic channels five, tells Colonel retired Victor Baranets, ten years worked in the structure of the ministry of formation and general staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screen shot of the site, which assumes orders for the weapon</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first - “army or military track”, i.e., the weapon, which was stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Weapon dragged Russian officers, and Caucasians themselves”, says Baranets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Following type “black weapon” - stolen by criminals in the representatives of primary structures.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranets explains, that here enter those taken away from the police storages, and stolen in directly the colleagues of law-enforcement agencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Illegal “stems” depart to sale from the military storages.</seg>
<seg id="23">The explosions frequently occurred on many military storages.</seg>
<seg id="24">“There are the proved versions, that the part of the arson they were made specially - in order to cover lack”, says the former serviceman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Their mite according to Barantsa, introduce the producers of weapon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">“Now propagate themselves the particular arms factories, which do not maintain competition on the International market and eject weapon from under the hem for the Black Market, including of Moscow”, says expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">One additional source “black” market - smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Especially much acts pistols and automatic weapons from the poor countries, for example, of Kirghizia.</seg>
<seg id="29">“There there is its production, sometimes primitive, and the Mafia, which organized flow”, was formed, explains the former serviceman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">From where weapon?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts calculated, which the approximate portion of each of the supply sources of illegal weapon for “black” market.</seg>
<seg id="32">Report about this in 2011 prepared the center of problematic analysis and state-administrative design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Specialists analyzed account MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) and Rosstata, kriminologicheskuyu literature and open data of portals on the weapons thematics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The overwhelming majority of the illegal weapon, write researchers, enters from the army and power ministries.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of entire weapon on the Black Market proved to be there “through fault of officials, whose work was connected with the weapon”, it is spoken in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data of researchers, 17% of cases the weapon enters from the places of armed conflicts, the embezzlements in the stage of the production of weapon occur in 14% of cases, 5% are fallen to “black archaeology”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Salesman-consultant of one of the weapons stores, that requested not to call his surname, it assures, what weapon, found by black diggers, already long ago no one buys - too old-.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most frequently, as he speaks, after the new party the salesmen will go to the military storage.</seg>
<seg id="39">Through the ensign the man buys one, for example pistol TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">To it they extract it, transfer through zaborchik.</seg>
<seg id="41">“It transports it into the city and here sells on 900 Euros for the piece with two stores”, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">“Pravda, the police in the policy of all matters; therefore periodically when burns plan with respect to the discoverability of crimes, is conducted control purchase in the merchants of illegal weapon”, adds consultant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">“As in the luxurious store”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Salesman and buyer most frequently find each other through the acquaintances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I glanced to the sites, into the blogs, until responds the comrade, who proposed to arrive to the platform “racing”, where there will be man, who will drive away me into “the corner”, where we will deal.</seg>
<seg id="46">I learned the price of stem only there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">military reviewer Victor Baranets</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In order to reach stem to me it is necessary the acquaintance, xwho has output, says salesman-consultant. - In me this acquaintance exists, but I in it am not confident.</seg>
<seg id="49">Salesmen on the markets exist, but it is there also necessary to arrive, conditionally, “from Ivan Ivanovich, who requested to transmit, that in daughter the tooth fell out”.</seg>
<seg id="50">I the now even pair of brass knuckles obtain through the man, in whom it is confident.</seg>
<seg id="51">It also them supplies only to me, because he knows that I will not return him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Novices search for weapon by different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">Former military Victor Baranets tried himself in the role of the buyer of illegal weapon in the middle of the 1990's, when article about this was prepared for the publication.</seg>
<seg id="54">Diagrams, according to him, did not change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">To it they gave album to the photographs, where there was “everything anything”.</seg>
<seg id="56">“I felt itself as in the luxurious store”, recalls serviceman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">To the buyer according to Barantsa, they do not propose tomcat in the bag - everything can be tried.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, potential client, simply do not buy - we will go with the salesman into the forest, we there target in.</seg>
<seg id="59">“To me they give the opportunity to shoot, and when I I am convinced, which beats weapon well, we begin to deal”, describes procedure expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Store on the sofa</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Prospectors in the Internet derive to the sites and groups in “Vkontakte”, where they propose to purchase weapon “for the different purposes”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">No documents and personal encounters are necessary for this.</seg>
<seg id="63">“It suffices to have the specific amount of money”, they write in the advertising cap on the site “to purchase combat pistol or automatic weapon”.</seg>
<seg id="64">On it the users leave their claims and pose questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">But to minor they do sell?</seg>
<seg id="66">“Without the license certainly”, asks user “Ivan” (orthography it is preserved).</seg>
<seg id="67">“Purchase TT. Moscow” - laconically formulates the request “of Fedorenkov”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The Federal Security Service now scattered the enormous network of false sites and those desiring to purchase combat weapon rows by shovel.</seg>
<seg id="69">People go as hungry fish to prikormku, and they then obtain in Siberia coal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">military reviewer and former military Victor Baranets</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I heard about these diagrams: usually site is registered beyond the limits of the action of Russian laws.</seg>
<seg id="72">People assume orders.</seg>
<seg id="73">The buyer through the automatic teller machine produces payment.</seg>
<seg id="74">“As the answer they send photograph and instruction, where is hidden weapon”, says the press-secretary of public organization “right to the weapon” Dmitriy Kislov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Victor Baranets asserts that after leaving claim on the site, it is possible to remain without the weapon and to go behind bars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">The Federal Security Service now scattered the enormous network of false sites and those desiring to purchase combat weapon rows by shovel.</seg>
<seg id="77">“People go as hungry fish to prikormku, and they then obtain in Siberia coal”, it asserts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">Makarov for 100 dollars</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">With the purchase of illegal small arms, according to the estimations of experts, it is possible to be packed in the sum from 100 to 900 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="80">According to Dmitriy Kislova from the organization “right to the weapon”, pistol of Makarov it is possible to acquire for 100-300 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Month, it is necessary to wait.</seg>
<seg id="82">It dispatches from the storages of prolonged storage by the management of these storages of middle link.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="83">On official stastistike of department, on the comparison from January to October 2011 the number of such crimes as a whole on Russia was reduced by 7% and composed 22.9 thousands, and a quantity of revealed facts of embezzlement and extortion of weapon, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8%.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">IN the USA strike the workers of fastfuda and supermarkets</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Through the work on cashbox “Makdonalds” it passes to fourth of all American adolescents</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the recent days on America gave a ride the wave of protest actions against the low wages in the department stores of the corporation of Walmart and restaurants of the popular networks of the fast food, such as “Makdonalds”, “Burger King”, “Tako of Bella”, “Uendis” and “by Kentucky frayd chiken”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Thus far no one undertakes to predict, will become this wave ninth wave or it is judged to be breathed out by it in the early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Actions support trade unions and number of left public organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besides an increase in the modest wages, which obtain the series workers of Walmart and system of the fast food, by the purpose of the organizers of protests appears the creation in them of trade-union organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus far this sector of economy barely is enveloped by trade-union motion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Actions began last week, after the day of gratitude, on so-called “black Friday”, when the orgy of cheap sales, which took million average men and which was being sometimes accompanied by brawls, was brought down in America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">During this day some workers of the corporation of Walmart, in which around the world work 2.2 million people, left their jobs and picketed together with the trade unions and left activists the stores of corporation, whose goods was calculated for the people of modest and average abundance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart deals in all in the light, from the diapers, hunting guns and automobile batteries to the vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores on the average from 8% to 27% are cheaper than in the large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore many low-paid workers of Walmart supply with goods themselves only in themselves on the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Accessibility and commodity bundle made Walmart of one of the largest corporations of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods podeshevke it partly because little pays its workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain about the heavy working conditions, for example, to the shortage of forklift trucks or manual scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Participants in the actions on “black Friday” required increasing wage and lamented to the fact that the cost of the medical insurance, allowed by corporation, ran up from 30 to 100 dollars per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">To the typical worker of Walmart, who obtains 9.5 dollars an hour, this expenditures not on the pocket, they spoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California to Berkeley prove, that if Walmart increases srednuyuyu wage to 12 dollars an hour, this will manage corporation in 3.2 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is approximately to 1.1% more than it spends on the wage now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart wholly shifts an increase in the wages in the arms of buyers, then each visit to store will bypass with them in all to 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the year they will spend on some 12.39 dollars more than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters Walmart sufficiently note that the protest actions occurred in all in nine states and applied the corporation not of maleyshchego damage.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Black Friday” continued in its stores from 8 hundred in the evening on Thursday to midnight of the following day, and sold about 5000 goods per second in this time of Walmart.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the whole its cash registers produced on “black Friday” almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The representative of corporation Dan Fogelman asserted in the interview for the left site of Huffington of Post, that the jobs left on the whole “less than five” the colleagues of Walmart, and that protest action was in all “current piarovskim trick” of its organized trade union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">“Free cashbox!”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests were continued on this week in New York, where their object were not the department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city they do not give, and therefore here thus far there are not them), but “Makdonaldsy” and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Makdonalds indicates that it sells billions of portions, and after this it even does not give to you hospital and does not pay you for the honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Dzhumeyn Williams, the member of the town soviet of New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At the given moment the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation, is 7.25 dollars in hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">The restaurants of the fast food with its time increase, but temporarily, and on the average their series workers obtain in New York 8.90 dollars in hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less them in this expensive city earns no one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As it is possible to exist in New York to such money, it is incomprehensible for me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through “Makdonaldsy” passed almost fourth of American adolescents, who earned additionally after their counters after school, living in this case in parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Almost no one saw in this the basic source of subsistence or he planned to be detained there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now I constantly run at the interview with the workers “of Makdonaldsov”, which complain, that they must live to this wage and sometimes even feed to it children.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the other side, on the forum of the newspaper of Wall Street Journal hangs the commentary, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to start children, if you do not know, on that you will feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Participants in the protest actions, which began in 6.30 mornings on Thursday in “Makdonaldsa” on the 40th street and on the Madison-avenue, required that to the cashiers and the cooks of the system of the fast food they would begin to pay as the minimum 15 dollars an hour, i.e., more than they doubled their current minimum earnings.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also required that in the sphere of the fast food trade-union organizations would be created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American law forbids administration this to prevent and to punish the activists of trade-union motion by fault findings and by releases.</seg>
<seg id="42">From the other side, the administration rarely facilitates them life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But to envelop with trade union the fast food is complicated for the objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main things - unusual staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discordant</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place during this day and in a number of other cheap restaurants of the Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of action was in the middle of day meeting in “Makdonaldsa” next to the Times-square, on which came out several local politician-Democrats, in particular, the member of the town soviet of Dzhumeyn Williams, who stated: “Makdonalds” indicates that it sells billions of portions, and after this it even does not give to you hospital and does not pay you for the honest work!”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for the post of the mayor of city Bill de Blasio, who stated that “we must harmoniously enter the support of the workers of the fast food so that they would attain the valid payment and economic prosperity, which deserves each New Yorker!”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As described occurred New York Times, this was the largest action of this type in the history of the American sphere of the fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But in it participated only several hundred people, besides far from all of them were the workers of the rapid public catering, in which in New York were occupied tens of thousands of people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is thus far unclear, this spark will give birth to the flame of mass motion.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">“Thus far to deceive the brain is average”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is recently accepted to receive theme of the augmented reality the popular among the worshippers of contemporary technologies in essence through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">First in summer at its annual conference the working model showed Google, and then it became in November known that claim to the appropriate patent gave Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, from the conversation with the team leader of interactive 3d-technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharamom Izadi it follows that for the scientific this companies are glasses - passed stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Them beckons the prospect for manipulation by virtual objects in air by naked hands, the creation of the virtual free spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Describe, if you please, briefly how is occupied your research group?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We deal with the cooperation of man with the machines, but in this case we attempt to move apart the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus far humanity in the mass got stuck in the stage of work with the pixels on flat screen, sometimes poking in them by finger.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to glance to 5-10 years to forward and foresee cardinal changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the prefix of Xbox and the sensors of Kinect - this is step forward, and almost not one Xbox without Kinect is today sold, indeed by all interestingly zhestovoe control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Which still us does wait in front?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- In spite of the fact that Kinect withstood interaction to the physical layer, much, until now, occurs on the flat screen, sometimes into 3d.</seg>
<seg id="13">Information input was improved (system obtains more than data), but conclusion thus far not very.</seg>
<seg id="14">We attempt this to change, work at the truly three-dimensional systems of mapping onto the base of different technologies, including of projective.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is necessary to let out the computer world into our, physical, to make its more touched.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only user, but also space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we are able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in much the more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And first of all - to feature these stupid helmets of virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- That you do think about vocal control?</seg>
<seg id="20">Popular piece, but they do not overestimate it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It definitely it is not possible to name panacea - arises a question of privacy, because it is not always desirable to notify those surrounding about its actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reality all forms of interaction with the computers are good, but each in their niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, for control devices in the public places in us was the project, within the framework of which we thought above the gestures, but not above the sweeping, but above such meager, short.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this case the gestures were removed not by the camera of device, but by the wrist bracelet, which fixed the motions of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus far it by large, but it is possible to theoretically decrease to the size of wrist watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But generally future after the mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- This as?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, as you will request me to transmit to you this jar of aeration?</seg>
<seg id="29">You will say and simultaneously will show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- I usually simply speak.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- O, this will very complicatedly recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- I.e., you do want to force users to be adapted under the fact that can or cannot at the given moment machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Is entirely not necessary, but this mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think, soon for us in essence it is necessary to work at the development of the new types of the sensors, which will make it possible to more precisely determine the reactions of man.</seg>
<seg id="35">This there can be, for example, laser sensors, they not bad permission in the depth, this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- If we speak about your work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect, such as you have claims to the contemporary cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Is not sufficient permission, depth or still something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- In principle current generation - this that, from what it is possible to be repulsed in our work on three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Certainly, well to obtain megas-pixel 8 with a velocity of 1000 C/s.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the matter not in megas-pixel themselves, but as the matrix and to depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">All current technologies for us are insufficiently good from a last point of view - this adds works to the designers of algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">I.e., it is necessary to remember not only about the permission in to x and y axes, but also Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also are very important speed, quantity of personnel per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The motions of man are sufficiently dynamic, and current 30 C/s it is frankly not enough, especially for the gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Steven Betishes from our Redmondskaya laboratory made a sensor of contact with the controlled delay of working - from 1 to 100 ms; moreover contemporary series sensors are nearer to the second (60-100) index.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not all are understood, how this influences man-machine interface.</seg>
<seg id="47">in my work the equivalent of this device, which does not only require contacts, greatly proved useful to me, so that the personnel it would be per second a little more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- A a quantity of cameras increased must not be?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- Into Kinect now there are three “cameras”, one of which in reality - infrared emitter, and the second - receiver of reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">But here already the third camera - this, strictly, the usual sensor of the visible region.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not adapt for determining the depth of object.</seg>
<seg id="52">A potentially larger quantity of cameras they could solve problem…</seg>
<seg id="53">Or to aggravate it, after increasing the required volume of calculations.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be create rather well the flexible analog of Kinect, be played a little with the curvature of the arrangement of cameras and look, as this will help in the three-dimensional determination of position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- To what extent I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, did not present to the public its glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You it does not seem that from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of the augmented reality glasses - this is one of the most promising platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Certainly, always to stroll, holding smartphone in the raised hands, is not very convenient, but this is what I think: the steepest version would be “transient” augmented reality, when on the basis of cloud platform you could be switched from the glasses to the smartphone, projection display and further everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Glasses - very personal device, in this their force (private things you see only you), and simultaneously weakness - augmented reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work at virtual objects together with other people.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">Vkusovshchina instead of the culture - Rosbalt. RU</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">“Rosbalt” continues the project “Petersburg advance guard”, dedicated to townspeople, which are located in front, in the advance guard of culture and art.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bright workers of the art-scene of Petersburg already fell in this top-list, whose achievements exceed the scope of city, frequently finding acknowledgement in Europe, passing All-Russian reputation.</seg>
<seg id="4">New hero “of Rosbalta” - epatazhnyy artist Cyril Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Entire city knows Cyril Miller - the bearded person, dressed in the entire red, who is encountered first in Russian museum, first in summer garden, then on the fashionable get-togethers and varnishing days.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cyril Miller's pictures always collect the crowds of the spectators, wherever they were not advanced.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cyril Miller - one of especially Petersburg social-philosophical skazochnikov, creators of new mythology.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cyril Miller - this the bright person of the Petersburg advance guard of the end of the 80th - the beginning of the 90th.</seg>
<seg id="9">Furthermore, he is man of city, by his appearance on the streets causing smile in townspeople, that raises by all mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently it in the hands took street organ and became Petersburg organ grinder, since it matured for this complex role by entire its bogemnym existence, by philosophy and by image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> - Cyril, and why you nevertheless do walk around the city in the entire red, but not in the yellow or turquoise, for example?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> - I selected red color as fashion designer, who carries out form and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this peace red color - this is a compromise between the artist, imidzhmeykerom and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although in the society everything which barely not gray, causes aggression and excitement of unkind property.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my provocations are directed toward that so that the conversation would begin.</seg>
<seg id="16">Entire history of my provocative actions - invitation to the discussion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> - A when you did understand that it must be artist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - At the exhibition in DK Nevskiy, where my works were put out.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood that this is my way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free of the type me were incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I began to be friends with the artists of new wave, with the postgazonevshchinoy, which led to “Pushkinskaya-10”, and more there was no wave.</seg>
<seg id="22">It throws me into the theater, clothing, music, in all genres, except word.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> - All this was combined in your Art-clinic… - To me it was important to appear in the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all best creative forces must be gathered.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995 I engaged territory in Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was repair, there were a musical-artistic club, bogemnyy club, house of Petersburg Bohemia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many there were born: NOMy, Tekila-jazz, I remember, as cord they brought with the project “ear of van Gog”.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cord and its friends of Paley under the plywood light songs, they were in the covering tricot, among them there was fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.</seg>
<seg id="27">When group began to play alive, it became “Leningrad”.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg was leading of many programs until the khali-galivskikh times.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave Trachtenberg to them, and his great career went, and base formation and training it obtained.</seg>
<seg id="30">Gallery “D 137”, club “Griboedov - these are echoes from the Art-clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">There our workers and habitues left.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am the hero of the yesterday's century, when culture meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000 interrogation was in the press, reward was “people of our city”.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the nomination “artist of year” was named I, my culmination ended.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the new times according to the old rules uncomfortably to work, I am man of truth, honesty and culture of past century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, it is possible to be popular, but by not very cultural.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> - By your in works is inherent the learned manner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> - Many my pictures - this Heath, in them the clearly expressed urgency and sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="39">In me there will be program exhibition, “Russian museum in the clowns”.</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns - timeless category.</seg>
<seg id="41">I earlier social was, to now be similar - this is painful and it is terrible.</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the clowns everything is spread, tragedy is removed.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love grotesque, i have grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, rescuing peace via totalitarian changing of clothes in the order order.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now they meet on odezhke, being oriented toward the external mechanics, but not to the internal person.</seg>
<seg id="46">But, it can, to it hand given it cannot be and into erysipelas spat necessary.</seg>
<seg id="47">And fraud will be taken with the aid of the changing of clothes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> - A recently we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - Cultural city must have this hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">To whom, as not to me, it to be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> - Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> - Now commercial art must be accurate, tactful, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="52">The disintegration of cultures occurs.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier people were brought down into the flocks, Bohemia one loved, simpletons another.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now all broke into the micro-associations, now with difficulty it will be pleased by all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not stodollarovaya paper in order by all to please.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is now necessary to think, you will please whom.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now in each cult hero on 100 worshippers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> - A to Mikhaylov's Stasa it comes on several thousand!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> - To it come broshenki, there sex-social sphere operates.</seg>
<seg id="60">But 300 people will arrive on the cultural soil, but 10,000 will not arrive, and as a result of less than the management, money, everything withers.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have worshippers, the main thing - not to deceive them, not to spoil nazhitoe.</seg>
<seg id="62">I in the youth wrote such pictures that in one collector they on the wall next to Falk and Larionovym hung.</seg>
<seg id="63">I began from the pictures, by which they usually conclude.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Concepts now frequently confuse.</seg>
<seg id="65">They say: culture is spiritual, the culture of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="66">Does not have culture whatever the consumption, this of another opera.</seg>
<seg id="67">I man of the culture of yesterday, grew based on the examples of the artists, who lived in poverty and died in misery, they rejected the money for the drawing of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="68">I for this here culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> - Cyril, what it is not sufficient to Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> - Good cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is this concept: official from the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But each of them can be occupied by culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">With the correct Tsars everything not so was, Tsars, can, greatly they did not understand in the culture, but they were understood, that it is necessary to hold correct experts.</seg>
<seg id="74">Good consultants are here in Moscow now.</seg>
<seg id="75">In our Petersburg the people exist, which could be experts, but they were begun to move, since the higher experts, who will correctly estimate these experts and will give road to them were necessary.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now flourishes vkusovshchinka.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same Erarta, but them distinguishes that the fact that they honestly indicate that we assume not all modern art, there are such artists, as must search for to themselves other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> - That such for you - Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79"> - Petersburg - this is not cultural capital, in Moscow the cultures are much more, there soil exists.</seg>
<seg id="80">But to art grow difficultly on our stones.</seg>
<seg id="81">Cultural soil is necessary to us, and writers it is now more than the readers, this is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="82">There are here in Europe very many people of those being curious. which walk to the exhibitions, concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">This layer is fine.</seg>
<seg id="84">We should make fashionable art as this was at the beginning of past century.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="8">“This Venus and Mars”, counts the senior scientific worker of the state astronomical institute of name P. k. of Sternberg (GAISH (State Astronomical Institute im. P.K. Shternberg)) Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">But if on Mars condition are more suitable for the life, then on the surface of Venus - the temperature of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">To live is possible only at a high altitude or in orbit of Venus… in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They began to approach questions of reproduction in space from the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Experiments on the plants still half a century ago were conducted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four generations grown pea of grown in orbit differed in no way from their terrestrial types.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then - orbital injection of insects, tiny fruit fly-drosophila.</seg>
<seg id="15">The eggs of quail in 1979 sent into space, in order to verify, as is developed embryo under weightlessness conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We obtain at the output of absolutely normal fledgling.</seg>
<seg id="17">But problem here further begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The problem, connected with the fact that this fledgling must find support, it must arise to its of leg and begin to move”, explains manager of the laboratory of the institute of biomedical problems (IMBP) RAN [Russian Academy of Science] Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without having found support, fledglings disorderly somersaulted.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the complete atrophy of instincts occurred after 10 hours in newborns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Fledglings did not react to the light and sound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">And there trouble was in the fact that they simply died in four days.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Even two times we peeled fledglings, they refused after this, because simply it cannot be there with them worked”, establishes failure of experiment with the fledglings in space Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last time biological “minikovcheg” flew in orbit of 16 years ago with animals.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, on the biological satellite “of Bion” there will be only unisexual individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was experiment with the rats, that were sent into space already with the fruit.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, they there revealed nothing supernatural.</seg>
<seg id="29">“This exactly was on the biological satellites, but furthermore - this is single experiment, and such research must be conducted”, notes Vladimir Sychev.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Posterity appeared after landing in space rats.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and in the state to create the becoming emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">For ethical reasons similar experiments are not conducted.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The largest risk was in the Tereshkovoy.</seg>
<seg id="39">But the most precious, that there is in humanity, this is female organism.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our seagull flew away, and no one on the Earth could say: it will be preserved after flight into space.</seg>
<seg id="41">It will know how to bear child after this flight.</seg>
<seg id="42">“Indeed this question no one answered”, tells the veteran of the rocket-space branch of Vakhtang Vachnadze.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, in all the year after flight into space, first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova bore daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child of Andriyan Nikolayev was also cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988 in second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskoy, by that twice visited orbit and even worked in outer space, was born son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is small, one it is counted the cosmonauts, in whom after endurance flights everything managed, and grows healthy generation.</seg>
<seg id="48">“A if is more, then this is dangerous even with the orbital flights”, sum up the sum airman-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia Valerie Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And nevertheless, to humanity it is necessary to search for some new ways in the biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Hydraulics laboratory TSPK - required preparation stage for the flight.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here under the conditions of zero buoyancy cosmonauts perfect the habits of work of outer space.</seg>
<seg id="52">Water imitates weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If for the adult water, let and comfortable, but nevertheless alien medium, then for the breast children - native element.</seg>
<seg id="54">Small ikhtiandry as if confirm - life to the land left the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Is a connection meanwhile that little-one it is located approximately 9 months in mom in the okoplodnoy liquid, to it to more easily become accustomed then to vodichke.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle this is logical, because from the moment of generation, from the moment of that first bathing, only of 2 weeks is passed.</seg>
<seg id="57">“This is very small in order something to forget”, says the instructor of grudnichkovogo floating the sea-scape of Aksenova.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">In a word, if weightlessness is more natural state for the born child, then for the woman - are necessary gravity, gravitational force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The muscles of stomach, basin very rapidly in weightlessness weaken, capability for the ejection of fruit falls.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well it is agreeable, let us lower even this, relying on the stimulators of labor.</seg>
<seg id="61">It is possible, of course, in the special camera to go to the kinds, it will eject it.</seg>
<seg id="62">“A is further that?” - poses nontrivial questions Valerie Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">From the other side, to child is also necessary artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without perceiving the earth's gravity, organism will not form skeleton and muscular system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Newly born in orbit it cannot be as adult, dressed into the special load suit for the trainings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It simply will be deprived which to it will be vital necessarily.</seg>
<seg id="67">“This experiment, to which we with you will go, after allowing the generation of child in the foreign medium, will lead to the fact that we will bring to the Earth invalid, completely dezadaptirovannogo person”, will foresee the leader of committee on bioethics IMBP RAN [Russian Academy of Science] Igor Pestov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Thus far the generation of children in space - question of theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, after this time it will be reality, when earthlings aboard their ships leave for the distant planet, which will become house for their descendants, originated in space.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chief for the main control and auditing administration: Checking Schwarz-system fell through through fault of politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the branch of public procurement the Czech Republic has available good organs of control and, in spite of the presence of qualitative legislation, it lags in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is the statement of Miroslav Kal, the Vice President for supreme control and auditing administration, from the interview for the site of Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">“Law never will be ideal, but to adapt it must correctly, what, in my opinion, is not sufficient”, it commented on the current situation of feces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The joint inspection of the Czech and German organs of control allows similar conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">_as example incorrect practice give Peter Nechas approach to so so-called Schwarz-system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently Prime Minister did state that GDP (civil Democratic Party) will not disturb owners by checkings - does leave this forbidden or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">“To law it follows to be any means those established, and, if it forbids something, then Prime Minister cannot resist the work of establishments, by which he is required to check and to seek fulfillment of commitments”, it establishes feces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the session of revisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German sides, within the framework of which was compared the legislation about public procurement of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">With which specifically did deal the discussion?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The parallel checking, which we began, probably two years ago, has.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply stated, speech about that which asserts European legislation, how they must pass public procurement, further follows national legislation and then also application in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">_all information be assembled and, even with still unfinished checking, reveal interesting difference - simply stated, legislation in us can be “precise and error-free”, however, in practice application we on some parameter be inferior Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Hence it follows that it is not enough to create ever more and the more precise rules, it is necessary to be concentrated during the application of a law itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But strictly as this project it can help you, that it for you does mean?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Specifically, this joint control can make a contribution to the efforts on the cessation of the refinement of laws, reduction and improvement of limitations, because this does not lead to the positive result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The economy indicates obtaining the corresponding thing for the reasonable (but not always low) price in order to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But not the fact that we this will reach, after lowering the limitation of orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Possibly, this system will overfill “by paper” so that those, who will wish to find holes in this system, will them find much easier than if limitation was not reduced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You speak about the internal problems of the practical application of legislation about the public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as does function control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there there this organization as our KRU (control and auditing control) or this does work otherwise?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As far as establishments are concerned, there as our KRU comes out Bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle; also there is a board, which works a little differently, but in essence of both establishments they function analogously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, authorities to the certain degree are similar, but since Germany has federal structure, there is subdivisions of Audit, also, at the level of the federal earth - in this their system differs somewhat from our.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">BRH can govern only federal money, we have available federal dollar.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal State Auditing Chamber.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What local legislation, it is there simpler than?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally, I did not want to compare without concrete data, but in a certain sense Germany can be taken as the model, but it cannot be definitely said that it is better in everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This so, because they better do manage the control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely no, but I will be repeated, to me similar comparisons do not please.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is necessary to say that even the model countries encounter many problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they did obtain no advantage from the collaboration with our office, it is correct?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If we speak about the domestic legislation, then as they were reflected in your establishment of correction to the law about the public procurement, by some means are manifested consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Taking into account that the juridical force of these corrections is sufficiently short, it still in no way appeared in our works on the control.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we carry out control through the fact, it is necessary to consider a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We take this into consideration only in the process of the preparation for future checkings - we began to use our new tool “the detection of the risk of neekonomnosti”, through which we drove away almost 14000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be manifested, because limitations change, the conditions of some types of tenders change and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">What do you think, the assertion of this law will bring benefit or increment load on the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law undoubtedly step in right direction, and, I hope, this will be confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem, which can arise, is such, that the rules “will be stiffened” and they cannot be will be impossible observed.</seg>
<seg id="40">With the functioning of the previous rules the controlled enterprises are tied with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in the fact that any nonobservance of law about the public procurement indicates the breach of the budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is worthwhile to in that case tighten law thus?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I think that by not this method.</seg>
<seg id="43">System must exclude those, who want to seize and to misuse, but not to punish those, who accomplish the formal error, which does not influence the solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">This system will only create an even larger pressure on bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And whereas to leave this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Give we realize, that this way anywhere will not bring.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently Prime Minister stated that GDP will not disturb owners by checkings of the so-called Schwarz-system. What this does mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">“Schwarz-system” is forbidden or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">To law it follows to be any means those established, and, if it forbids something, then Prime Minister cannot resist the work of organs, by which he is required to check and to seek fulfillment of commitments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is possible to say: “We change this law and it is permitted this”, but it cannot be indicated that we will be shut, as if nothing it occurs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Law about the public procurement contains sufficiently strict rules, as which must formally be carried out, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, from the other side, this is tragic, when candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of the formal deficiencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">Szymon Ornest: On the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What you do think about the fact that less than in the month must begin the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This entire-only one of many alarming news, on which we, people, so easily fall.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tap Tap we constantly joke on this theme even we say together with the group of That we - the only group in the world, which will be able to gather sufficiently positive energy in order to postpone or to avoid the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Moreover, in December you intend to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Could you in greater detail describe about this to the readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The discussion deals with the general national measure for the collection of means, which we plan here already for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We decided to use the marketing potential, which possesses the calendar of the Mayas, against end of which it is declared on December 21 in 11: 10.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the day before this event, on December 20 in 21:00 in parallel start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrave.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will end, speaking in general terms, at that moment, when in Kiribati island in Pacific Ocean, whose time zone for 12 hours earlier than, is completed May calendar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Coma did come to mind this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This was originally my idea, further we everything devised together with our artist of Gonzoy Augustoy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Beside the fact that we want to accumulate sufficiently positive energy and to avoid the end of the world, we also want together with the community to think above the fact, in which state we will once communicate this peace to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On occasion the end of May calendar we created the unique collection of objects from the foot-wear, sports shirts, bags and original small keys against the end of the world. These things it is possible to purchase on the site www.e-tap.cz and to thus at the same time show us support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The group of The Tap Tap together with other musicians also carried out hymn against the end of the world, which is called “the end of the world it abolishes”.</seg>
<seg id="16">Will sound that already catching the fancy to the listeners of YouTube hymn on these benefisnykh concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Certainly, in the end itself, if as a result everything comes out and the end of the world will not begin.</seg>
<seg id="18">It will begin to sing all executors on all concerts simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hymns simultaneously zazvuchat also in straight ether of Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip Tomasz Ganak, participates in execution also Xindl of the X…</seg>
<seg id="21">How you did begin with them to collaborate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also collaborate with other personas of Czech cultural life, since we carry out many charitable measures and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We try to actively connect them to these projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It seemed that by many it pleases with us to work, by them it is interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">On that will go the gain from the concert against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year we so work with the civil association of Tap in the institute of Edlichki.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instructors regularly attend the students of the schools of the institute of Edlichki and take with them merry and interesting measures.</seg>
<seg id="28">Students themselves do not have means in order to leave to the instructors, and we try thus to grant to them this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="29">Within the framework of the project of the additional building of the institute of Edlichki in the future will arise separately the building, to which we will move with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Several musical groups and executors will come out on each concert.</seg>
<seg id="31">Were such the criteria of selection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to compose the program, which will interest all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will come out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere Danom Bartas, The Tap Tap, Marianne Bango and Irzhi are dry.</seg>
<seg id="34">About all components it is possible to learn on the site www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Do plan you any similar “mega-events” in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We will in May for the first time come out at the festival “Prague spring” and let us here, of course, prepare interesting program with the interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the following year we with the pleasure conducted idea in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, already if we will be in the USA, greatly would want to come out in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About the foreign countries you have serious plans, you already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The group of The Tap Tap - this is group of people with the limited opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How you do manage the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">This is not so as is terrible, as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five participants on the electrical invalid carriages, their carriages must travel in the luggage compartment, in addition the large number of load and boxes with the tools.</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, until they managed this without the problems. Czech airlines ČSA and British airlines of British Airways were always excellent for us prepared which how often astonished me.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything passed without the problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">You can compare the different countries from the point of view of accessibility, relation of community to the invalids and so on because of the departures for the boundary.</seg>
<seg id="46">Which you did encounter up to the present moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxemburg, London and other countries, where everything functions better than, in Russia we became the witnesses of the fact that to the east of still is located on the base level.</seg>
<seg id="48">In comparison with Prague in Moscow many barriers, and here still appear into the wonder the independent movement of man on the electrical invalid carriage in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also there not in the course such commonplace things how to yield road to invalid in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, and there already appear the public organizations, which try to focus attention of people to the problems of people with the limited opportunities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">But in what, on the contrary, we constantly must overtake the foremost countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many things, the level of performance of which is far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to refine that the improvement and improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, this concerns whom.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is completely normal, that people with the heavy form of disability independently are moved on the streets, they can descend into the toilet, into the museum, yes where it is convenient…</seg>
<seg id="55">There is not very extended the fact that the large number of people with the limited opportunities takes active part in public life, in this we them from The Tap Tap a little anticipate!</seg>
<seg id="56">The respect for community or bezbarernost - this one thing, but at the moment, when among us appear well-known athletes, artists, actors, policy or lawyers, then everything and really will begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">Thus far these are the single cases - people with the strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group of The Tap Tap at present is very popular, but let us return for two years ago, which did in 1998 you force it to organize?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered into the institute of Edlichki as educator, around me there were many young people, which wanted to study anything.</seg>
<seg id="60">But since I musician himself play including and on the saxophone, together with the colleague organized interesting musical circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and in the course of time, as speaks our leading after getting along Angelovich, this a little left from under the control (it laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But popularity did arrive only in recent years, or I something do confuse?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">This is truth, us helped the fact that we began to be joined to the famous singers and actively to work at the propaganda of group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can estimate, as if there does not exist in the essence.</seg>
<seg id="65">We can allow ourselves the qualified instructors, equipment and so on because of the means of the European Union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Did stand before you the purpose so to untwist well The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to make something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="68">In show business it is full of things, imitating each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, entire new starts with the caution, and this lasts for long.</seg>
<seg id="70">There exists very few rare things, but I will dare to say that Tap Tap one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression in man, who us sees, of course, pity, this is natural…</seg>
<seg id="72">But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with the limited opportunities are not some suffering and all neglected personalities, which we must pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people, which can live valuable life and be developed, of course, only when they possess the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if in people with the disability something is obtained, this is shift not only for them, but also for entire society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Did ensure success the fact that you are a strict leader, such as you do consider many?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to make work qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromising and hold specific discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I consider that this is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people to us come with the romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they learn, that two times a week they must walk on the rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and carry out much time in the road, they very rapidly lose enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But so it occurs in any group, which wants to work and to reach something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At present in the composition of the group of The Tap Tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">Their how much were at the beginning in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one after getting along Angelovich.</seg>
<seg id="83">We the open group, people come and depart, this cannot be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those, in whom is a desire the force of will, our doors are always opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It takes place in the day to the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 into 21.00.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Concert will pass in Prague on the stadium of Incheba, in Brno - in the club of Fléda and Ostrave - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">In the completion of concert all three cities are connected by phone conference at the moment of the performance of the song of the group of The Tap Tap “the end of the world it abolishes”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Purpose of this project - to gather financial means in a volume of 25 million crowns to the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO with the institute of Edlichki in Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Ticket to the concert costs 400 crowns, for the children of up to 12 years entrance free. Tickets can be purchased previously into Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at the ministerial session of European Space Agency Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern block (after the Czech Republic, which it became full-fledged term EKA on September 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close collaboration with EKA in 1994 and for the subsequent years was accepted active participation in a number of the projects of agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But way to space Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the Second World War Polish enthusiasts dealt with voyages into space, but this was not always encountered with the understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I will resemble, for example, about A. Sternfeld's lecture, who on December 6, 1933 represented in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from his innovative work “introduction into cosmonautics”.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of young engineer (1905 g. r.) left the audience of indifferent, Sternfeld recalled after several years, that only the doctor Ian Gadomskiy was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in France Sternfeld won reward of Robert to Esnaupeltrie and Andre Louis Khirsha for “the introduction into cosmonautics”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The doctor Ian Gadomskiy (1899 - 1966), whom was discussed above, more lately became the great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">It published in Polish periodicals hundreds of articles and wrote the row of the books, dedicated to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskiy became the well-known world propagandist of cosmonautics, and his contribution was evaluated including by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in its honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In Poland was already in 1925 built the railroad trolley, equipped with rocket engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, just as to the detail of project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear even, for the acceleration or for braking of cart had to be used the rocket.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about this trolley is known only from the press of that epoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Since 1933 Polish artillery began to think about the rocket arrows.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study accomplished the section of the technology of weapon with the collaboration with professors Mechislav Volfke and Gustav Mokzhitsky.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is evident from the preserved materials that studies reached the stage of service tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But works were interrupted with the arrival of German troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 in the specialized press the idea of the photoelectric of rocket-fighter, which proposed engineer Rogozinskiy, appeared, and in the following year published work “air rocket-torpedo and aviation rocket-bomb” author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotskogo.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before war itself with all designs of the military use of rocket engineering dealt the temporary scientific-consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated entire work.</seg>
<seg id="23">Committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended because of the beginning of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The following scientific work, dedicated to cosmonautics, appeared in the Polish press after war, because of the work of the Polish society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">About the society are for the first time mentioned during by Noyabrsk number of 1954 of the journal “problems”, in which are published four volumetric articles on the astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them the professor of M. sub-OTOHIV proposed to organize the society, which will be occupied by cosmonautics.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time the designs of satellites already collected revolutions, and it was clear that space studies - promising branch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of astronautics (POA) attempted to enter the international federation of astronautics (based in 1951), and already in autumn POA became its full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">But in the following year the first chairman of POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the international federation of astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">On this post it remained to its quite death, which began in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 POA made the significant contribution to development of very successful sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, while the first starting took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket, capable of covering the distance of 1800 m, there were into the length of approximately 80 cm, and its weight comprised less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Was subsequently built the improved version RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovskom vacant land were carried out testing two-stage rocket RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">This rocket was into the length of approximately 1,4 m, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">The following version of rocket was able be occupied to already by this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and observation of the wind at high altitudes was its task.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in 1962 further development was stopped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor of the first rockets of the type RM became rocket Meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">Rocket was planned as its two-step, overall length it was 510 cm, and initial weight - 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Were developed three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1S), which were distinguished by the size of camera for the scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rocket Meteor-1A had available space with a volume of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1S - 0, 62l.</seg>
<seg id="42">Maximum flying distance in all three types was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968 the development of rocket in the aviation institute passed Meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket Meteor-2 with a launching weight of 380 kg was capable of deriving payload with the weight of 10 kg on the height of approximately 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then were built versions Meteor-2N and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is worthwhile to also mention about the entry of Poland in COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and creation of the national committee of COSPAR by two for years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Furthermore, within the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland participated in the space research on the Soviet satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevskiy became the second interkosmonavtom after Vladimir Remek.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Last week Constitutional Court annulled law about the social activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">Decision caused the lively discussion in the society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Undoubtedly, it will interestingly look at this problems from a wider point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">the Liberal-oriented economic systems in the European Union, just as in globalizovannom peace, are based on the principle of the plural, uncontrolled economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the essence this means that the separate economic subdivisions, national economic systems, are found in a constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is connected with the principle of free trade and free, with anything unconfined motion of the private capital together with the unbridled financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Price stress appears as a result of the substantial difference in the cost of labor force (wages).</seg>
<seg id="9">By this concept it is necessary to understand the state, when producer by means of the delivery of budget item tries to withstand in the economic competition by the fact that he " brings down” the cost of competitor for the purpose to take away to himself the large part of the market and to, thus, increase his own income.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a mass scale this indicates for the majority of owners either the transfer of production for the boundary or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result rises unemployment in those in the countries, where the cost of labor force, in comparison with others, high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the private capital bears no social responsibility, including for unemployment the produced by it, the inevitable expenditures of state for social needs grow.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a whole, the situation strengthens the unwillingness of gentlemen of owners to pay taxes and to thus compensate the public economic and social damage, applied by them in pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Situation is so well known that it is not necessary to cite concrete statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="14">The unceremonious methods of the private capital are created at the level of the economies of the individual states of the situation, when the governments of the countries are forced to enter into the competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population for the purpose of attraction into the country of the foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments return their own population to the arbitrariness to the private capital, in spite of the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This finds, first of all, its reflection in changes in the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Purpose it is to economically force its people to obey the dictates of the private capital, first of all in the region of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This acts as the system of economic coercion in the case of the long-term unemployment and it at the same time serves as the tool of urezaniya of the rights of workers in the sphere of working legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result rises the level of poverty, and at the same time also the difference between the poor and rich.</seg>
<seg id="20">IN the FRG already for several years there is a public distribution of the products poor, which one cannot feed itself by its own labor.</seg>
<seg id="21">A quantity of these people already approaches million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within the framework of an increase in the competitive ability of German economy constantly occur the cases, when the job-placed people obtain such wage, which state to them must pay the remainder so that they would obtain the subsistence minimum.</seg>
<seg id="23">A similar scandal became known to community, also, in the case of the additional workers of Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures practically in all southern states the European Union, undoubtedly, lead to the same state, in which the people, which are found under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in social status, are forced either to emigrate, as this was in the 19th century or exist to the beggarly wage in the rear of society in the hope, that sometimes into the country will arrive particular investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, it does ask itself, from where it will undertake?</seg>
<seg id="26">If capital arrives from other countries the European Union, then poverty move of one country into another, or it will not arrive generally, since Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turk, marokkanets, Egyptian, African still work for a fraction of European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This concerns entire Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">The liberal theory and mass media to nausea assert that the state cannot participate in capital of her own economy, that the managed economy leads to the economic catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital persistently insists on what the state must not by the controlling actions interfere in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Further one should answer a question, does not act the private capital, now practically manager of policy and thereby entire state, for her own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">Single-valued answer - yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Existence of the practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states is proof.</seg>
<seg id="33">As result we have the endless situation, which is manifested in corruption, the guarantee of the mutual advantages, in the legislation, where practically everything deserves punishment; however, it is not crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">IN the FRG the situation is such, that the state ministries because of the shortage of financial means charge the development of bills to the particular law firms, which are tightly connected with the industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Bundestag asserts then these bills.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power proceeds not from the people, as says Western type constitution, but from the financial-powerful groups, which prefer its own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy now rapidly occurs in this situation as this described by Appianus in the work “crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey”: “State has already long ago been decomposed, and departments deal with violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal obtaining of favors with the aid of the stones and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people it walked to the selections with the previously sold voice ""… considerable people generally they were not a candidate to the post of ruler, finally once state for eight months remained without the consul”…. “seriously they began to speak, that only rescuing in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need of the selection of energetic person”:. Appianus thought that this there will be Pompey, but Caesar, who finally replaced democracy to the autocracy, became them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in the antiquity, in the contemporary society predominate her own reckless interests without taking into account public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital is not already in its essence intended for the application for public purposes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Present result does not differ from the past: the unprecedented decline of elite without any effort to conduct the reforms of deeper nature.</seg>
<seg id="43">Mean the reason for the appearance of the Fascist and Communist regimes we they must search for in the reckless liberalization of economic systems 19 and 20 centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today the absence of these regimes and existence of liberal type democracy can be received as the specific pause, after which is expected the following stage.</seg>
<seg id="45">Is first of all tragic the fact that the current elite completely ignores consequences into hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophes, which we even now observe, together with the crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cancellation of law about the social activities is not the solution or, at least, not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition both on the international and at the national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic it will be forced to continue to search for ways for further decrease in the social level of population.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus this tendency bears system nature.</seg>
<seg id="49">The purposeful political and social reforms, which will make it possible to strengthen the shared participation of state in the economy, are the solution, will strengthen the role of citizens in management of state and will weaken the sole position of the private capital in the society in favor of state.</seg>

<seg id="4">Last wave of violence between Israel and throttle control, as always, caused many responses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some speak in favor of Israel, arguing its position fact that it has right to the self-defense, and Palestinians appear in the role of terrorists, others they support Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of Israeli state, by genocide, perfected above the Palestinian Arabs, and the role of terrorist state is assigned of the State of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="6">I do not want to reflect about that, who in these periodically repetitive waves of murders - criminal, but who is victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the been self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and they were not the witnesses of the beginning of violence.</seg>
<seg id="7">My purpose - this to propose at the readers to glance for the curtain, to look to that, whom, first of all, serve the lasting already 95 years stress (counting from the signing of Balfour's declaration in November 1917) in the small section Near East earth.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some my reasonings are reinforced historic evidence, some of them are brought out on the basis of my own understanding of that, who or what group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity - this is, first of all, the history of power contest.</seg>
<seg id="10">In each epoch we can find the same of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so clear - always whether these people completely independently undertook their steps, or someone stood after their throne, who directed their actions to the previously intended targets.</seg>
<seg id="12">One should assume that we live during the period in which world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and authority resulting of them could not occur for the life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among the astronomically rich families it is allotted by one, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (I do not know, it does stand someone above them, but this it is not excluded) - Rotschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Much do not write about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is understood.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first news agency (Reyters) they purchased already in the 90's 19 centuries in order to end the rumors, which connect their name with the criminal actions in the influential circles, in shadows of which they were located, and which always led to strengthening of their authority, increase of wealth or simultaneously both to that and to another.</seg>
<seg id="17">In them are located the large shareholdings almost in all Central Banks of peace, and against the countries, in whose Central Banks they do not have available their portion, they Veduta or prepare the war (to the invasion into Afghanistan was only of 7 countries, after invasion into Iraq it became 5 countries, after the overthrow by Gaddafi it remained only four; however, at the same time Russian government took the Central Bank of its country in its hands).</seg>
<seg id="18">Any, who attempted to resist this family, died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve status of the Central Bank for the Rotshildovskim of Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to let out his own (understand - government) money and it was killed in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">John F. Kennedy began to let out his own money and wanted to cancel FED (the Federal Reserve), it was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to give to the court to FED for unbinding of great economic crisis in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst of world authority in the period since 1859 until 1871 led to the development of the plan of three World Wars, created by the great freemason of the 33rd level by Albert Payk.</seg>
<seg id="22">The destruction of monarchist states in Europe was the task of the first war, the second had to destroy the colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third must lead to the reduction of world population approximately to 0,5-1 billion people (this quantity of slaves it will be sufficient for guaranteeing of their comfort and luxury, and they they will not consume many resources), creation of the united universal religion (ecumenicalism it cannot be anything different, except as by prerequisite for this project) and final seizure of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">By the method, with the aid of which works the group of the richest families headed by Rotschilds, appears the call of crisis and subsequent proposal of the solutions (order ab of chao - order from chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">But these solutions are false and always Veduta to worsening in the situation (see the base FED, which it had to avoid the repetition of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus after they succeeded in unleashing the First World War by means of the murder of the gabsburgskogo heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand into Sarajevo, they they destroyed tsarist Russia, after beginning Bolshevik revolyutsiiyu.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended with the sudden, unjustified in military and economic sense surrender of Germany (no longer there was need for war for the destruction of tsarist Russia) and, as a result, it occurred the breaking up of Central European power, Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">For facilitating unbinding the Second World War the bankers and policy created the concealed conflict situation, after putting in Germany enormous military reparation, than they created prerequisite for radicalization of the become poor masses, then it remained to only toss up the Germans of sufficiently strong, revealing the guilty and proposing the simple solutions leader, to further create multinational Czechoslovakia with the strong German minority, which it had to play, and it actually played the function of the fifth column, during kindling of the fire of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century Rotschilds provoked the base of the Zionist motion, whose one branch they attempted to create Jewish state, it is desirable in the region of historical Israelites with Jerusalem as its capital (return in Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">Balfour's mentioned above declaration created prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, began to occur the first collisions with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks occurred from both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War flared up, it is difficult to estimate, was pulled out Hitler from the chains, in which it originally held the bankers, or everything that it made, it was planned, in any event the sufferings of European Jews in the concentration camps created prerequisites for the acknowledgement of Jewish state as the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially based in 1948 and, similar Germany was provoked by military reparation to the 2nd World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed in order to create the seat of war of the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If for international bankers succeeds in it untying, Jewish people, as in the Second World War, it will become the victim of military operations on the front line, now already together with the Arab or, simply stated, Muslim population of the Near East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel - this as if gigantic laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only sharp separation of people into the supporters and enemies of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty, while who is victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the offence does generate offence in the endless chain of violence, if everything did begin from greediness of the individual persons and their tendency toward the world authority?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is here necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as, international bankers slip to people for the voting on the selections of exceptionally our own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu's hawk is the typical example of Fascist, loyal to international bankers by politician, making all in order to begin the war with Iran, which, because of membership of Iran in Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan…), it will threaten develop into world conflict, and taking into account the control of Iran over the Ormuzskiy strait, which contains 20% of all world oil stockpiles (navigable corridor it is altogetheronly 2 miles by width), it will also lead to the destruction of world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In what light are now manifested the words, said by David Rockefeller in 1994: “Everything which to us is necessary - this is general crisis, and people will accept new world order”.</seg>
<seg id="39">New world order in their idea - this is peace of gentlemen and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">Peace, where the remaining part of the human population serves the handful of financial aristocracy, which is delighted in by comfort.</seg>

<seg id="1">Film “operation “of slang”: When worse nowhere, cause Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 the crowd of Islamic student-demonstrators took the embassy of the USA in Teheran and took in hostages 52 diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="3">They had to be freed in exchange for the thrown down Shah of Mohammed the cuts of Pahlevi, who ran after revolution in the USA, which were the patron of his regime during the decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The positive outcome of situation was not assumed for the US Administration - it could not afford to reject Shah outside, because this in the root could blow up the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, to reach the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of theocratic regime, it was not in the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">This was impact on the prestige of the United States, which later was intensified by the unsuccessful attempt to free hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The concluded diplomats were finally freed 444 days, after talks with the mediation of the government of Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate caused houses the wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defeat in Iran to a considerable degree contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter on the presidential elections of the 1980's year, which were completed by the election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film, srezhessirovannyy by actor by Ben Affleck “operation “of slang” describes one of the episodes of that history, which brought to America small victories.</seg>
<seg id="11">For six workers it was possible to run out not long before the occupation of embassy.</seg>
<seg id="12">After complex troubles they finished their way in the residence of the embassy of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA in the collaboration with the Canadian authorities it was possible to take away them from Iran, in this case helped the extravagant legend of cover, according to which they left along the Canadian passports as the members of the film crew, which sought out in the country place for the surveys of science fiction epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of the genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert for “the evacuation” of Tony Mendes, required the collaboration of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that the legend would be reliable, in the specialized periodicals it was written about the project of film, press conferences were arranged, the fictitious production company had real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of operation long time were held in the secret, film, was based on the memoirs of Tony Mendesa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Affleck's film - this is the special combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">From one side, real political thriller, the so-called “film-kinoopus”, the history of successful undertaking, shady transaction - an example can be the row of films about the friends of Oushena.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the film constantly change the moods - from one side, documentary planned scenes from Teheran (in the captions are shown the sign historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no large differences in this).</seg>
<seg id="21">From the other side, facilitated are the Hollywood fragments, which are interesected irony and moderate exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">But then other scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other establishments - man in the suits discuss situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of establishments, on the telephone…</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Ben Affleck it was noticeably possible to make a restart of career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the ridiculed actor he became the respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of mockery.</seg>
<seg id="25">“The operation “of slang” its third full-length film, after dark detective “good-bye, detka, good-bye” (2007) and thriller “city” (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time this is the first film of Affleck, who is not removed in the home town of director - Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A feeling of the atmosphere of place in this case relates to the qualities, which raised the earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And Affleck this manifests in “the slang”, where Canada " plays Teheran”.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film occur on the streets, with reconstruction of real events - the entrance scenes of a drop in the embassy impress by their clarity, which also transfers to the emotion of confusion and unpredictability, which appear, when history somewhere suddenly changes.</seg>
<seg id="30">Similar effect Affleck and his colleague they reach in the scenes of those invented (false staff in the Teheran market).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">There are too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">For director it was necessary to deal with the fact that the narration does not assume many gripping scenes of cinematographic value.</seg>
<seg id="33">It sufficiently successfully works with this few, sometimes something finishes considering - there all this leaves not so elegantly (scene, in which phone call in America it prevents the moved crisis in the airport of Teheran, and pursuit on the takeoff and landing strip they appear sufficiently nadumanno).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">A drawback “in the slang” is the absent-mindedness, connected with the need for showing too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Gudman in the role of Hollywood colleagues is actually very charming; however, their characters would deserve larger space, but they in the film far from only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">It is not sufficient to Affleck's film a little dramatic nature, this is the film, which can be looked with the moderate interest, evaluating setting and retro-style, which recreates the thrillers of the seventieths.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it seizes with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, this it is sufficient for reminding about one, still in a certain sense living history, and also for the evidence of that how ideas about the omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence agencies are exaggerated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rules of the inflation of the balloons, bananas and the circus</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, the yearly conducting interrogation about the most absurd bank collections, now decided to declare competition to “most absurd decision or project from the workshop of the European Union”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">“Us spodviglo to this the last event, in which the European Union plans to accept 40-percent quota for the women in the administration of important European companies”, stated “to right” the organizer of questionnaire Patrick Nager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among absurdities the already advanced to the nomination - recent resolution of the European Court for the association of the rate of insurance payments for the men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, of woman had the privileges to life insurance, because for the insurance companies they are objectively less subjected to risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">“Further improbable ideas from the workshop of the European Union people can advance to the competition prior to the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Voting itself it will pass to the end the February 2013”, said Nager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The questionable orders the European Union include, for example, the required addition of biological component in the fuel-, which as a result damages on nature, and also prohibition to the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small quantity of dangerous substances, or directive about the size of cell for the hens, in consequence of which in this year substantially became dearer eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Criticism also underwent actual prohibition to the use of a term “buterbrodnoe oil” or withdrawal from sale of classical lamps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Qualitative bananas must be the length of 14 centimeters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Pan-European apparatus will frequently deliver verdict under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels usually protect by any state or group of the states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of veta it defends the requirements of its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The interests of lobby are such: for example, the bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach length in 14 cm and they did not dare to manifest “anomalous curvature”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In this case the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonizes the existing separate national rules, which complicated trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The European Union, in spite of the resistance of some states, it nevertheless softened the standards, which are concerned fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directives will lead to the dissipation of products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Candidate for the gain in the interrogation can become the last year's decision the European Union, according to which the sold air balls necessarily must be supplied with warning about the fact that the children of younger than eight years cannot inflate them without the care of adult.</seg>
<seg id="16">The European Union it turned to the American studies, in accordance with which air balls with the game are the potential cause of death of children by means of the suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar limitation now applies to children of up to 14 years, by which it is forbidden to blow into fair dudelki.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Amusing ideas are born and the house</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Sufficient to absurd appears the rule, which is concerned most European officials: each, who has in the European Union any official post, cannot, taking into account the delicacy of theme for Greece, to use a name of Macedonia, but it must instead of this tell “in BYURM” (former Yugoslavian republic Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The portal of Bankovnípoplatky.com in the collaboration with the association of liberal economists “principle of nonintervention” (Laissez Faire), proposed for the voting, besides several above absurd rules indicated, for example, rule the European Union about the volume of food reserves in the territory of membership state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The European Union established the maximum volume of the levels of subsistence, which can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently the Czech Republic exceeded the, for example, established volumes of the konservirovannykh fungi, for which large penalty threatened to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of questionnaire also interested the idea to pay some countries for the fact that they do not have sea, and idea about the assignment of subsidies for the statement about obtaining of subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas arose in Prague, but not in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">“We are located at a great disadvantage, because we do not have sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Let us request the European Union about compensation”, stated in the fall of 2004 the then agriculture minister Yaroslav Palas (CHSDP).</seg>
<seg id="27">It indicated as the argument that in the country there was the high harvest of grain, and the so-called interventsionnykh purchases state as a result had the complete storages of the reserves, which must be exported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the fact that the Czech Republic is located far from the ports, the European Union, according to Palasu, it had to pay us hundreds of millions of Euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The as a result European Commission went towards the Czech Republic, organizing tender to the purchase of grain from the countries, which do not have an access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies for obtaining the subsidy proposed to villages ministry for regional development, directed by minister Pavel Nemtsem (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go for the composition of statement on the subsidy from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">European Union: Whimsical orders are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the decisions in the member states easily become the object of criticism, effort the European Union for regulation, and also on the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, faster acknowledgement deserve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Serious problem, in the opinion of the experts, is the dipping of grants the European Union to the projects, which do not have even hint to something general with the deepening of the European integration; however, which member state they attained with the consideration of budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Are caused the emotions among the Czechs and that the fact that as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, it not always winning in this contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Although the Czechs after six years of combat with the Germans and by Austrians preserved designation “Olomoutskie syrki” however “Tuzemskiy rum”, whose traditions in our country depart by roots into 19 century, our producers had to rename to “Tuzemak”.</seg>
<seg id="36">Be called rum can only products from the cane distillate, but not of the sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of the registered products the European Union, together with world famous by cheeses “feta” and “gorgondzola”, marzipan from German Lubeck or Parma ham, already proved to be, for example, karlovarskie blocks, pogorzhelitskiy and trshebonskiy carp and zhatetskiy hop.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">People want so that I would protect the republic, but I lover, it asserts Okamura.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr. is the senator, as to man it does occur to be a candidate to the post of the President?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I do not think about very becoming the senator or President.</seg>
<seg id="4">If in our country everything would function without the problems, then I anywhere was not a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I no longer can look, as the country plunders in the last 20 years, as thieves here fuss, to people increase taxes and retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I did not have ambitions to be politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something which me does not please, then I attempt to find the solution, as this to change.</seg>
<seg id="8">But since to me has already been carried out forty years and I the independent person, who relates not to what party, i do not have another opportunity to influence thing, except as to be a candidate to the post of the senator or President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">You fell in the senate, but soon they left for the presidential lock.</seg>
<seg id="10">Are not turned you thus by back to the people, which you did select?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I always said that I will be included in fight for the presidential lock depending on election result into the senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I specified that if I will be selected by the senator, then I will be a candidate in the Presidents.</seg>
<seg id="13">My purpose is not post, post - this the tool, with the aid of which I can carry out my views.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore i are necessary the naibolshee influence and the widest authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">But difficulty not only in the fact that we as nation grumble in our bar or in television, but in this case they are ready to trample anyone who will try something to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this they are added by the media outlets, which man ochernyayut, and which confuse freedom of speech with the freedom of lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, about me they indicated that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was adviser Irzhi Paroubeka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let us pass to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">Fight for the presidential lock you began with the theses about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about the reverse property declarations for the sum higher than twenty millions.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order this to carry out, it is necessary to change law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You as the President such authorities do not have, and only entire senate can propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">How you do want to solve this task?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as the citizen lobbied that so that conducting excursions would become free enterprise, this was possible to move forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Problem consists in the political intrigue - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or to the right, obstacles intentionally make to it, and this holds in control citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the independent nonpartisan person I have much larger potential for obtaining the support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage in the fact that I without party raskladyvaniya on the shelves, without caution for the dogmas can take in each party that what is best for our country, and to use this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You do consider yourselves man, it is more by those relating to the right or to the leftists?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From a Czech point of view it seems me that me people carry faster to the leftists.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me it is not generally important - a little to the left or a little to the right.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is important for me so that we dispatch forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">The discussion deals not with that which someone relates to the right, but someone to the leftists, I want to combine people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I will always support any good for the society solution, will propose his KPCHM or to GDP, and I in exactly the same manner will be against the poor idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You are angered, when someone indicates that you are Populist.</seg>
<seg id="34">But do not prove you this to those that you did say?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">When you create business-plan for the firm, in you are also some ideal purposes the views.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you try to approach this.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is possible to name this populism, but all proposals, about which I speak, they already function in the world, or prominent experts speak about them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without the support of parliament to you will remain only slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">But you for long will not be held with this in the policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or you do think that when you will leave to the people and you will have a talk with them, then for you will succeed in realizing criminal and material liability?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I do not have another opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only to convince politicians, journalists and community and to attempt to entice them to its side so that we would attain our.</seg>
<seg id="43">If I was selected by the President, then it would not comprise problem to organize straight television relaying, into which I will turn myself to the chairmen of parliamentary parties with the call to legalize material and criminal liability for the politicians, public servants, judges and attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="44">And they, in the case of failure, had to report, why this they do not want.</seg>
<seg id="45">If there will be the strong personality, which will record abuses, then it will be possible to show pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take straight Presidential elections - this was the merit of pressure from the side of community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I indicate directly that I am lover, but not genius and not intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to search for allies in order to defend its persuasions and views.</seg>
<seg id="49">I only beginning in the policy, and for my program will attempt to obtain the support of majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">I attempt to move independently the matters; when this will not succeed, in six years I will finish and will return to the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This partly sounds in the manner that as if Okamura must save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am any not rescuer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that one I nothing will make; therefore I went around the number of well-known people with the proposal to be a candidate into the senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused in connection with the large volume of work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also I at least supported the chief investigations woman journalist to Ian Lorentz, who opened swindle with the light fuel petroleum products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I advanced my candidature because people and it is really not satisfied, but now I perceive itself on the weights.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of people do not send to the selections, but the majority of those, who went they selected the representatives of establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">Us independent in the senate only two.</seg>
<seg id="59">People selected the senate so that the changes will be achieved with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="60">In spite of this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the straight selections of mayors and governors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You do think about the base of our own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I yet did not think about this, because i do not have time to that in order to check the cleanliness of past each potential supporter, and i do not have any to this of money.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no money, also, to the presidential campaign, on my transparent calculation only twenty thousand crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You do not have money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You do speak about the property declarations, and as do proceed your own matters concerning this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">The personal effects is evaluated approximately at 60 millions.</seg>
<seg id="67">In me is a section in Prague with the cost of approximately 25 millions, the apartment to 10 millions, one additional apartment to 8 millions, the collection of the works of art by approximately 10 millions, Aston-Martin to 3.5 millions and the damage of Superb to million, well still several million on the calculation.</seg>
<seg id="68">By the way Aston-Martin in me appeared, because this was my malchishechya dream - me always pleased Dzheyms Bond, who drove in the machine, there was galanten with the women and at the same time it fought with the meanness and lawlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You do drive on Aston-Martin, you do manage property to 60 millions and you do not have money to the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change republic, but its own money especially into this to pack you do not want.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15-TI of millions to the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I must get in into the debts?</seg>
<seg id="74">In the campaign I put already 2.5 millions.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that i do not have sponsors, attests to the fact that my program is not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obligated to pay for the pre-election campaign from my pocket.</seg>
<seg id="77">Expenditures for campaign to me in the essence will cover senatorial wage.</seg>
<seg id="78">But to these money I did not live, for example, it could not pay son for the English school, which stands 30,000 monthly.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to only earn money, then anywhere he was not a candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">It does mean, further you will be occupied by enterprise so that it would be possible to live?</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps you did not say that you will reduce this activity?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this does not depend on the amount of wage.</seg>
<seg id="83">As I promised, I partially decreased my activity.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, the managing director of tourist agency will in spring become my deputy.</seg>
<seg id="85">People would want, that I was bessrebrennikom, which will store republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also should to something live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">How much, as owner, you did become accustomed to obtain monthly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that I obtain even further.</seg>
<seg id="89">But if I would become the President, then its enterprise would finish.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects of MVRDV prove, what present adventures are not only in the imagination - based on the example Speykenisse and its recently constructed book mountain - 2 photographs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">“To me this building seems merry, it appears futuristichno, at long last in us again it is possible to see something interesting”, tells Lizette Verkhayg, passer-by on the edge of road.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Stephan Spermon, specialist in IT in the located hereabout important enterprise, counts as follows: “No, this building is actually beautiful”.</seg>
<seg id="4">But I ask itself: why to us today one additional library?</seg>
<seg id="5">In all is the Internet, iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now already no one voluntarily does walk into such old-fashioned libraries, it is correct?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Speykenisse, to maloprimechatelnomu sleeping town in the environs of Rotterdam, belongs uncommon record.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its population by number 80,000 people have the very low level of formation in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">With this annoying circumstance several years ago it was for dealing decided to make a contribution to the general formation and to construct seven fictitious bridges, which were depicted on the bank notes of the Euro, in the form of the picturesquely painted miniatures from the reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this enlightenment initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the fathers of city understood that the only opportunity to overcome the statistics remained in them: to construct here library!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Blame Maas from rotterdamskogo architectural bureau MVRDV, the master of daring bar graphs and the author of ingenious, sometimes even cynical buildings, it related to the task with its usual imperturbability and appeared during competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and grin on face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And thus far the terms of judges ozadachenno were examined and pressed by arms, audacious Maas accumulated from his original gift pyramid according to the size and completed the speech in defense of his project by the following words: “Respected townspeople!”</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is it, my proposal: “Book mountain” into Speykenisse, so-called Bukenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">This mountain with the cost of 30 million Euros grew after nine years.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the aspect of the project of revitalizatsii, which includes also underground garage, supermarket, mail several adjacent to them apartment buildings and taunkhausov on the whole to 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November “book mountain” was noted by the second reward of competition “best library of the Netherlands 2012”.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also project participates in the national Dutch competition of the wooden construction of 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, the faceless suburb, which before could not propose anything, except postmodern pedestrian zone and amazingly plain town hall, whose white facades suggest about the dairy, it became more richly by one contemporary work of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the main thing is in Speykenisse appeared first in the history of this town public building of cultural designation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Long road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: book Eldorado under the cap for the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">Here only one elevator, which passes in the center of mountainous area, indeed the real worshippers of architecture and reading will prefer to investigate this locality on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">Accomodation glazed from all sides - bright and easily visible, hems from the fired brick and elegant street lamps error-free create the sensation of public urban area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Urban environment is recreated ideally.</seg>
<seg id="26">View involuntarily searches for benches, dogs and the football boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere - the book, the book, the book.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">“Usually book regiments stand along the facades, and in the middle is arranged with large the dark hall, as a rule cheerless and faceless”, says blame Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We placed the classical configuration of space from the feet to the head and took out zone for reading from within outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal space of book mountain is used skillfully: in the center are arranged offices, the Internet-library, chess club, ecological center and technical accomodations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Especially gladden the black book regiments, which serve first as finishing walls, first by parapets, then by stairs rails.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their form, texture and smell are uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even the experienced architects and building engineers are lost in the guesses, however, that this behind the unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">“We attempted to work with the second materials”, explain Yop It trauborst, the leader of project, Speykenisse presenting community, in accordance with the requirements of standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once in one agrarian enterprise in Frislandii we met the suitable by-product of agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Already many years in the hot-houses and in the fields in the Netherlands as the backing under the roots adapt the artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness.</seg>
<seg id="37">This cheaply and economizes time.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thin textile serves one-two seasons, after this it is possible to eject it.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library this fabric - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed in the panel by thickness four centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the action of heat and pressure so-called landbauplastik (KLP) is converted into the dark, uniform, durable material, on the smell a little resembling new car and a little athletic shoe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To the top of Veduta of 105 steps.</seg>
<seg id="42">The one who will overcome way with the length of almost 500 meters, will be compensated in the literary cafe not only by fantastic view of city, but also by Dutch croquets and by wood ficuies in the pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They worry about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of air on the literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Expenditures for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“It is difficult to believe, but this building, in spite of many glass surfaces, is model project in the plan of ecology”, he says It trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">For its heating and cooling the heat of the earth is used.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book mountain stands under the bell jar, even during the clear days the sun falls inward only temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="48">Wide farms from kleenoy wood, located perpendicularly to glass facade, give shadow and is picked up the large part of the solar rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">Climate in the accomodation is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">Full-automatic roll blinds ensure remaining protection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stephan Spermon, which was being mentioned above skeptic from the sphere IT, already visited new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lizette Verkhayg also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">But also the instructor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who named Bukenberg “the soul to Speykenisse, whom has long ago not been sufficient”.</seg>
<seg id="54">Reason: after several weeks before the discovery each inhabitant obtained the invitation to endow one book of his own meeting.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books had to occupy empty places on the regiments of the yet not completely complete library - at that moment in it there were 70,000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">Idea operated.</seg>
<seg id="57">Regiments are blocked upward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">“There is nothing worse than half-empty library”, says architect blame Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">“I think that because of our invitation the now each inhabitant is somehow connected with this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Each knows that its book is the part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it serves only for the adornment.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, MVRDV was possible to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Speykenisse wrote its literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And let they are very young and neobrazovanny.</seg>
<seg id="65">This indeed only initial point for constructing the identity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Sabo: “Germans must play more important role”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany restrained during the voting about the acknowledgement of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the opinion of Stefena Sabo, expert according to the relations between the USA and Europe, entering so, Berlin balances on the narrow diplomatic path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of week Germany first gave to understand that it will vote against the claim of Palestinians to obtaining of status of observer with the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin restrained during the voting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stefen Sabo: Germany does not support the action of Israelis in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany it is necessary to be to careful in connection with its special relations with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But simultaneously I consider that American position it also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - in this case without coming out is too critically with respect to Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also restrained during the voting about the introduction of forbidden zone for the flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result of NATO was conducted this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of Germany it is difficult to occupy a clear position on complex international questions?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, this thus.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact is that it is located in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely passes from the policy, which, so to speak, governed the USA, to strictly the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans lacks the matched united policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, Germans again occur between two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected from them that they will play the more independent role, but they to this did not become accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="19">I consider that until they only grope their role, but they are located on the way to “to more normal” foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">To such foreign policy, as France or Great Britain carries out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">However, what does specifically indicate “normal” foreign policy from a German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">This is the readiness to occupy the position, depending on the US position or European partners, in its national interests.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e., from the export and connections with the defined regions, by such as Russia, China or the Near East.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economic interests of Germany to a considerable degree differ from the interests of other important states, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Did influence these economic interests the position in the Middle Eastern conflict and the voting in the United Nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has the large markets for sale in the Near East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore it should manifest caution in order not to insult community and elite in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any event this plays its role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I did not give to this of too great significance, this is not completely one-way communication.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any event this plays important role in the calculations of Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Did do harm Germany to its relations with the USA, abstaining during the adoption of the decisions of major importance, such as voting about Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am confident, that in Europe and even in the USA predominates understanding German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore I do not think that this was the same dramatic break, as in a Libyan question.</seg>
<seg id="34">Possibly, Germany even will acquire the determined respect thus.</seg>
<seg id="35">Indeed this it signals about the fact that it should be received seriously as the player in the international arena and that it is necessary to consider its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The USA, on the contrary, clearly supported the veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is a divergence of opinions between the USA and many European states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Such differences existed always in view of American domestic policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">I consider that Obama's government in the depth of soul has a sufficient understanding of European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with the local political situation government, of course, cannot openly occupy this position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the essential divergences in the opinion are not entirely so significant, as always it is represented.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you examine the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then you will note that Obama entirely not in the enthusiasm from the politicians Netanyahu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is easy whether Germany to combine its close connections with Israel and USA from one side and the position of the most important partner in the European Union with another?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Think, precisely, this makes the situation of such difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Certainly, to Germans there would be somewhat simpler, if there would be a united, noncontradictory European policy, but now this is not so.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore they cannot come out within the framework of the wider approach and are forced instead of this to act, resting only on its own vision of situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">Specifically, so they act with the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future Germany will take upon itself the leading role in the production of general European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is understandable that this is complex for Germany, at least because of the connections with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This theme was always ticklish.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think, to Germans it is clear that they must play the more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany itself does see itself in the role of important international player - will not take it for itself actually main role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or the leading role is still heavily given to Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany yet did not become accustomed to this, by it, until now, it is always unpleasant and, for the obvious reasons, until now, it is always heavily given to play significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Let us examine, for example, the crisis of the Euro - each time, when Germany takes to itself important role, the most varied anti-German feelings are manifested.</seg>
<seg id="57">To Germans it is not simple to manage this.</seg>
<seg id="58">Strictly, this is the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by the hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view Germany is located in considerably the more difficult position than by the USA.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must take into consideration of the most different neighbors and opinion, and this is complex.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Thus, the influence of the USA in the European policy constantly does weaken, but at the given moment the European Union does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?</seg>
<seg id="62">For Germans simply it is necessary to play more significant role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you this does not please, unpleasantly or strengthens dislike to you - life is such!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Stefen Sabo - deputy director of transatlantic academy in Washington, the institute, in which the academicians and expert-political scientists from Europe and North America together investigate the problems of transatlantic association.</seg>
<seg id="65">Furthermore, Sabo - member of the German fund for Marshall, in whom it specializes in the German policy, foreign policy of the USA and transatlantic connections.</seg>

<seg id="10">So from Gucci it is obtained by Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada it is possible to register Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">By the same method are legally copied German enterprises, for example the producer of sport goods of Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattlokh opens folder with the records of the department of the registration of trade marks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010 Chinese company registered the there commercial sign of Zegna DF Puma, the artificial name, in which is used also the name of the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese - world champions of copying and disturbance of intellectual property rights, is known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the large cities there are the many-storeyed department stores, which sell forgeries, almost exclusively.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the matters of Pattlokha are not such. On the commission of its constituents it speaks against Chinese enterprises would completely officially obtaining from the department of the registration of trade marks the right to use the name, which has already been guarded somewhere still.</seg>
<seg id="17">Chinese call this “the ban of minpay”, stamp-passenger.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word is associated s “the ban of dakuan”.</seg>
<seg id="19">So call the women, who hunt for the rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Chinese authorities are not recognized after itself fault</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">“This does damage to business, with this it is necessary to fight”, is convinced Pattlokh.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Trade mark is eroded, unique position is lost, image very strongly suffers”.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and processual expenses in the injured branches are calculated by million, especially in the case of the expensive copied products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the data of company for market researches CLSA, China with a volume of sales of 15 billion Euros is per year the third according to the size and very rapidly growing market for the sale of the objects of luxury.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, to attain the removal of doubtful records in the list of commercial signs is difficult, and costs this dearly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Process can last of up to nine years, with the obscure outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattlokh tells about the matters, in which the court slanted actions, since after the long time the protested name became “realia of market”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If to plaintiff it does not transport, then it even will be must pay plagiarist, since damage to its commercial sign in China applied, speaks Pattlokh.</seg>
<seg id="29">Law of the jungle sometimes here guides.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also the famous matters about the adornments.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the company of Daimler lost judicial dispute with the producer of the construction vehicles of Sany, enterprise, which not long before that acquired the firm-producer of the concrete feeding pumps of Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore Chinese, until now, have the right to use the emblem, similar to the star of Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Company of Geely the purchased Volvo initially used the bluish white logotype, which resembled BMW; process was successful, Geely it was necessary to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The producer of fashionable goods of Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked into the other side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The department of the registration of trade marks CTMO in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of the shortage of personnel and equipment of accomodations they there took place of difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the past year occurred “the return from the emergency in the working process to the standard”.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, a quantity of unprocessed matters for objections decreased by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57,000 such matters was closed, 75 percent higher than in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless 81,500 claims still wait production in the department.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To fight with this is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As very frequently in China, numbers impress.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the past year in CTMO entered more than 1,4 million statements about the protection of commercial signs, almost to third greater than into 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This record means that China tenth time contract headed the list of new registrations in the entire world, department reports.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same concern the total number of real commercial signs, only 5.5 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="46">Were in 2011 paid 1.8 billion yuan of collections.</seg>
<seg id="47">If we simplify, this means that each registration costs on the average of 1280 yuan or 160 Euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To protest it stands many times more, as shows the affair of the German family enterprise of Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For a period more than of seven years the concern fights with the Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Germans it was possible to attain that the illegal production by it false automotive parts was liquidated.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, imitator fastened to itself Chinese rights to the commercial sign of Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">This was its own omission, since surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, speaks Khanno Venttsler, the chairman of the administration of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the department of the registration of commercial signs CTMO deflected the claim of myunkhentsev.</seg>
<seg id="54">True, in both following instances of Freudenberg it won, but contrary side continues fight, until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It is necessary to be on the alert</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now a question is found on the examination in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Venttsler hopes to bring the matter to a good completion and praises the professionalism of courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also speaks: “The process extremely of roads takes away much time, money and nerves”.</seg>
<seg id="59">Internal expenditures hardly yield to calculation, for the archive of firm it was necessary to examine even reports of centenary remoteness in order to give proofs.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago of Freudenberg it without result proposed to contrary side “large six-place sum of the Euro” for the regulating.</seg>
<seg id="61">“It is hence clear, as dearly this us costs”, says Venttsler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers of the Far East threaten to throw even into Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Namely when imitators will register the unprotected commercial signs there after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thus, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the designation of Freudenberg for the foot-wear and articles made of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="65">Concern has long ago ended production in these regions, but in spite of this it could avoid registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">“It is necessary to be on the alert”, says Venttsler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and attorney Pattlokh recommend to German enterprises to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international standings about the protection of trade marks, faster foreigners follows “everything which in any manner is worth protecting, recording also in China”, says Venttsler.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise this can manage considerably more expensive than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Actually: if Freudenberg loses in the last report of its drama about the commercial sign, then it will have to pay contrary side the license fees for the proper name, is explained Venttsler.</seg>
<seg id="71">They will otherwise us extrude from the market in the questionable segment.</seg>

<seg id="1">World day of AIDS: to pritoptyvat, to sing, to help</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Khaydelberge rehearses the chorus of Imbongi - while in Swaziland the orphans of AIDS are glad at this.</seg>
<seg id="3">History of the relations, which covered the distance more than 8733 kilometers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First is heard pritopyvanie: cowboy boots, basketball athletic shoes, lady boats and men's sneakers select time on the parquet sex and rapidly find it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Times-two-three-four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only after this slowly increase voices of singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they begin, they charm and follow each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">And You fite Hopf, 29-year-old conductor, only it does not jump out from its cloth shoes, when it conducts by their flexible and expressive gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The evening of Monday, in the musical hall of the institute of medical psychology in Khaydelberge the chorus of Imbongi rehearses new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">To the rehearsal arrived fifty participants in the chorus from 23 to 69 years, from spetsialistki in genetics of man to the yard-keeper.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Ohm " of Obani” - complex thing, each voice of chorus has his text and furthermore in the completely alien language: Zulu, on which speak eleven million people in the Southern Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Aid for the self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">According to the estimation of Unaids, program of the United Nations according to the fight with AIDS, in the world are counted about 34 million HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million of them live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland it lives 245 000 orphans of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">In this case more than 40 percent of population HIV-are positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village of Esitzheni the association of Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attend the school, which prepares for further instruction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As 15 or 20 Euros per month it is possible to take supervision upon itself.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees to the child of money for the school, school form and daily hot dinner in the Gogo-center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi in the Zulu language means teller or praiser.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this hall they do not tell rapidly on bow, then they know how to sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Almost ten years chorus learn songs in this strange soft language and it from time to time even brings them again there, where they for the first time appeared: to the south of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Khaydelberga, in the northwest of kingdom Swaziland, is located the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the voices of German chorus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There live about 2000 people, some, until now, in the simple cabins from the clay and straw, among the inhabitants there are many children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them remained without the parents, who died of the virus ICH.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitzheni in the miniature is reflected the disease of entire of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV-infection, the lowest in the world expected lifetime according to the data of UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Cutting extreme flesh in men, which dokazanno decreases the risk of infection half, among the population barely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland bear in itself the virus of immunodeficiency, death on the middle of fourth ten - not rarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Chorus opened this village in the joint trip through Africa in the spring of 2005, but before participants in Imbogni saw many children on the streets, to which not only parental concern was not sufficient, but also it is simple in all: food, clothing, formation.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without the school formation the man in the poor country does not have generally any chances.</seg>
<seg id="32">First this was the particular obligation of individual participants - after several Euro to per year send child into the school and to give to it the opportunity of times in the day to obtain hot food.</seg>
<seg id="33">But already year later chorus established association “Voices for Africa”, which from those times almost professionally worries about the orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts about the infections, transferred through sex</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are such the most important diseases, transferred through sex?</seg>
<seg id="36">To bacterial IPPP carry syphillis, khlamidioz and gonorrhoea (gonorrhea).</seg>
<seg id="37">By frequent virus IPPP appear HIV, human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pubic pediculosis and itch relate to parasitic IPPP.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Are such the basic beaten groups?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphillis and gonorrhea are encountered in essence in the men, who deal with sex with the men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The institute of Robert Koch proceeds from the fact that the minimum into four of every five cases of syphillis, registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of the sexual contacts between the men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In heterosexual adult people the frequently meeting diseases, which are transmitted through sex, are khlamidiynye infections, trikhomoniaz, candidiasis (cap), the gonorrhea and human papilloma-virus.</seg>
<seg id="43">Propagation HIV among the heterosexual adult comparatively low - however about 20 percent of new infections HIV is fallen to this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the young people khlamidiynye infections are encountered substantially more frequently than among other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European data, three fourths of all infections strike young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Among the young people human papilloma-virus also frequently is encountered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How does change the number of cases of infection?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all diseases, transferred through sex, are subject to required registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">Morbidity by syphillis, according this of the institute of Robert Koch, more than it was doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 before 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new infections HIV since 2007 is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="51">There were in 2011 about 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This approximately to one is tenth less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms do indicate the venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">With the infectious diseases can appear the ulcers in the region genitalia, complaint during the urination, isolation, the pain of below stomach, and also phials or packing.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, frequently they are not accompanied by the pains and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How it is possible to be protected?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms are capable of decreasing the risk of infection, but they do not give hundred per-cent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Indeed partially the agents of the diseases, which are transmitted through sex, can be extended also via contact infection, also, with the close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore experts recommend regular inspection, especially with the frequent change of sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">With early diagnostics it is possible to cure majority IPPP and to avoid the distant consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Supervision, donations and not lastly fees for the appearances of chorus on entire Germany make it possible something to gather.</seg>
<seg id="62">“In all we sent in Esitzheni already about 200 000 Euros”, speaks You annete Lennartts, the chairman of association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In village itself money from Germany manages Tsodva to Dlamini, conscious and active woman.</seg>
<seg id="64">It worries also that the orphans would be well arranged, for example in one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Gogos, as old women are called on the Zulu, this is the support of village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them accepted to itself to 14 orphans, they give to them roof overhead and they worry that the children in the form each day in time would appear at the lessons.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those, in whom it did not remain relatives, enter shelter to Khaniysile, lonely woman, who obtains wage from the association, just as two cooks, which each day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Furthermore, association “Voices for Africa” organized sewing school, it constructed two chicken coops and together with the American organization for the protection of health PSI organized the delivery of analysis on HIV for many inhabitants of village.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is difficult to represent, but about the disease, which is so obvious in the entire country, they prefer deeply to keep silent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">King with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">“AIDS - this absolute taboo”, says You annete Lennartts, “because it is connected with sexuality”.</seg>
<seg id="72">It is sufficiently uncommon for the country, in which the king officially has 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king To msvati to the THE III, is noted for his love for the excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, on this sanctioned by state style of life also lies fault for the fact that the virus ICH just as rapidly was extended in last years.</seg>
<seg id="76">But it lies also on the vagrant workers, who resound virus in the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms exist literally at each angle, speaks You annete Lennartts, “but them barely they use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Another culture - flesh to the flesh”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to a little support cultural exchange, the chorus of Ibmogni every two or three years accomplishes trip on the south of Africa and sings songs, complete melancholy, combat spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which know even many on the southern edge of the dark continent from the times of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus, complete of white, which sing songs in the black language - this acknowledgement not only brings good mood and happiness, but even, it occurred, tears on the eyes of severe border-guards were caused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Trip always leads also in Esitzheni, where the singers attend sponsored children.</seg>
<seg id="82">In spite of the fact that small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the valley of the river of Etsulveni it more than is noted for.</seg>
<seg id="83">“Iditol in Esitzheni, there light”, say local people.</seg>
<seg id="84">But back into Khaydelberg, when the stamping singers return to the rehearsal hall on the street of Bergkhaymer, it is possible to see after 8733-kilometer overflight which burns also this light here.</seg>

<seg id="50">Our views into the universe: the most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Probably, telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem - even before Galileos Galileo by year more lately approached the observation of the stars.</seg>
<seg id="52">The mirrors of optical telescopes became increasingly more from those times - and accessible to their view spaces increasingly are deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, namely from 1947 until 1975, the telescope “to challah” in the observatory Palomar in the environs of San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, depicted here, had a diameter of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA, it is established “large binocular telescope”.</seg>
<seg id="56">It makes it possible to look into space with the aid of two mirrors, each with the diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">“The boundary of tele-SKOPYO Kanarias” has gigantic internal device - the diameter one mirror alone it is 10.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror “large south African telescope” in the Southern Africa is segmented - for a reduction in the cost.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless in the diameter it reaches approximately eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">Deficiency in the inexpensive design concept: telescope is rigidly fastened at vertical angle - this limits its mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Telescope “hobby-Eberli” in Texas also has the fixed vertical angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its special feature: the high light-collecting ability.</seg>
<seg id="63">It reaches - in spite of a comparatively small diameter of mirror - the parameters of the largest world telescopes.</seg>

<seg id="69">Its four mirrors make it possible to illuminate even average infrared spectrum in the telescope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">In the Chilean observatory ESO also is planned the installation of European “very large telescope”.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror must be stretched to the entire 42 meters - and it will be comprised of the almost 1000 specular elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, photographs it follows to expect not earlier than 2018.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007 both telescopes “cake” on the Hawaiian volcano of valerian of Kea were considered largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">In them are established two mirrors by diameter on ten meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">Telescopes “cake” enter into the composition of the observatory of Mauna Kea, which together with them looks into the sky also with the aid of the telescopes “sub-ARU” and IRTTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Furthermore, in Mauna Kea must appear new gigantic telescope - with the mirror with the diameter of thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">To here it is possible admire by it on the illustration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important forms from space supplies space telescope “Hubble”.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since April 24, 1990 it supplies the pictures of distant peace.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009 space telescope “Kepler” searches for planets beyond the limits of the solar system -, first of all, such, on which is possible the life.</seg>
<seg id="81">On February 2, 2011 of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) it reported that 1235 planet-candidates were discovered since the beginning of the mission.</seg>

<seg id="83">The space telescope of James Webb (JWST) will be sent for space not earlier than 2018 on board the rocket “Ariane 5”.</seg>
<seg id="84">The main mirror of infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: it must on the light of the first stars and galaxies search for large explosion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that at the south pole of mercury there are glacial.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is no reliable data about this, since “Messenger” it revolves nearer to the north pole of planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements for a period of decades indicated that on mercury there are glacial.</seg>
<seg id="89">- To the first, which revolves around mercury - scientists now in this are assured because of the neglected in 2004 probe “Messenger”.</seg>

<seg id="5">In South Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach po--Biblical honorable age.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here even there is a museum of longevity.</seg>
<seg id="7">The search for solution in the country, where the 97--year old men seem by also comparatively young.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The trip through the Talyshskie mountains can be named wild and romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">Microbus with the rumble rolls along the twisting road of the by been overgrown with dense forests hills, stormy creeks and simple peasant houses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything all around is so green and vividly, that it is possible to think, as if you are located in Shvartsvalde.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this is the very southern edge of Azerbaijan, Iranian boundary is located in all in several kilometers hence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here they live talyshi - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which known a little, perhaps only that they wonderfully speak on Farsi and azerbayzhdanskom and differ in terms of longevity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Terminal point is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">Small town boasts by too heavy an architecture of Soviet times, which in no way harmonizes with the picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe barely arrive here, road from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="16">To 323 kilometers it departs eight hours, since road has only one strip.</seg>
<seg id="17">Legendary wealth, by which the country is obliged to oil of Caspian Sea, here, into the province, until it reaches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that in Lerike there is how to interest tourists.</seg>
<seg id="19">“In May Baku became famous by the festival of song Eurovision - and in the following year takes place the festival of the oldest people of peace”, says Fatulaeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It - the director of the museum of longevity, probably, only in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Is here documented the biography of approximately eight dozen talyshey from these places, by which it is more than 100 years. Fatulaeva indicates the black and white photograph.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is my grand-dad, to it here 120 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the age of 136 years in it one additional child was born</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But the questionable star of museum is the shepherd of Shirali Myuslyumov, to whom allegedly were carried out 168 years.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is no evidence about the generation, however.</seg>
<seg id="26">But taking into account the fact that to the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, was carried out 122 years, the age of Myuslyumova is extremely doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="27">“It was born in this region in 1805, it died in 1973”, is explained Fatulaeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years in it allegedly was born the daughter.</seg>
<seg id="29">Thus did add the shepherd of Myuslyumov to vapor of tens of years to his age?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Indeed even Rembrandt Sholts, the researcher of age from the institute of Max Planck in Rostoke, heard about the veterans in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Are surprising many people of old age it is possible to meet also in some regions of China, in Japan or in the valley of Khunza in Pakistan”, says Sholts, “in Sardinia also live extremely many very old people”.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the scientific confirmation of age is impossible because of the absence of documents, since there were no lists of civil status.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Each day is the container of boiled oil</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless there is the fact that people in Lerika region surprisingly frequently reach Biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">20 people now here live older than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why here, in the south, so there are many veterans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Azerbaijan guide Farid to Mugimzade explains this by the special genes talyshey.</seg>
<seg id="38">The director of the museum of Fatulaeva, on the contrary, believes that the matter in the nourishment.</seg>
<seg id="39">Talyshi they love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink on the container of boiled oil each day. However, hardly this high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietological point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or the matter in the primitive way of life, which does preserve to people youth? In Chengemirane, tiny settlement not far from Leriy city, lives Mirzoev's Rubaba.</seg>
<seg id="41">In 97 years it is still comparatively young for these latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzaev, which asserts that in it 143 descendants, it lives in the simple wooden house, typical for entire Caucasian region.</seg>
<seg id="43">It sits on the sex with the barrel of oil, which it rolls hither and thither without tiredness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzaevoy, xwho long ago already have their grandsons.</seg>
<seg id="45">Two little-ones also hereabout skip.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the kitchen the tea, which will give in the typical pot-bellied containers to armudu, is prepared for guests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In Mirzaevoy ideally flat and strong white teeth, under the head shawl it hides the long dark-light-brown scythes, which its son with the pride reveals before us.</seg>
<seg id="48">I always my hair by milk, so that they fell out nor preserved never colored.</seg>
<seg id="49">“I never used shampoo”, he says mirzaeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Of monthly pension is sufficient to the life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It always ate only that which grew in its own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">For entire life I never bought products in the store.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then she tells about its husband, who served in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most heavy was after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it became better, when “dear father” Heydar Aliev arose in the control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Propaganda frequently does not sound in the speech of old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the cult, created around the figure of the father of nation, who was guided by the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan practically does not know boundaries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">It was in the authority until 2003, then brazdy of administration accepted its son Ilham.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless among the Azerbaijan old men there is no misery.</seg>
<seg id="60">230 manatov (approximately equal to the same sum of the Euro) of Mirzaev are obtained monthly as the pension, this is the sum for the local conditions, for which it is possible to live well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And the, possibly, long ago grown son of the Mirzaevoy also of the rights: “Old men in our culture use deep respect”.</seg>
<seg id="62">They live in the large family, they are loved, surrounded by concern and they are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">How not reason to remain in the living as is longer as possible</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Word “human rights” is absent from the constitution</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Revolution returned to Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competing demonstrations in Cairo testify about the deep division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The future constitution, based on Sharia, met furious rebuff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian President was not stingy to the enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="6">We must create passage.</seg>
<seg id="7">“Its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before the god”, he said on the government television.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its speech was inverted to entire people, but first of all to the Christian Copts, liberals, educated to Moslems and to nereligioznym Egyptians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Indeed they all, until now, hopeless separated in the lost opposition, experience fear.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fear before the religious state on the Nile on the favor of the powerful “Muslim Brotherhood”.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mohamed Morsi, only whether without apologizing, said that it temporarily reduced the scope of Constitutional Court and enlarged its scope, “in order to save revolution”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, that 61--year engineer, who has the degree of the doctor of the US university of South California, in reality wants to save, it is not completely clear to the Egyptians and the entire world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Will be deprived of force judicial authority?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Actually 234 articles were possible to drag through in the night 15-hour jump with the obstacles at the Islamically disposed constitutional meeting of 100 participants, and this partially causes alarm.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in the previous constitutions, in the project it is indicated that the legal procedure rests on “the principles of Islamic right”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">But which does mean “principles”?</seg>
<seg id="17">This was and remains the matter of interpretation, and it is possible to fear that the Islamists will use diffuse formulation and juridical gap for a stricter interpretation of Sharia appearing in connection with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least, at this one newly introduced article hints: in all matters, which are concerned Sharia, should be drawn for the council university al-Ashar, most important Islamic establishment of the country, which is used the great authority in the entire Sunni Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is not must, but it can mean that clergy oversees after the legislation, which would de facto have by consequence a limitation of judicial authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the draft constitution much is the object of the interpretation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">One additional problem: must be preserved the jurisdiction of citizens to military court.</seg>
<seg id="22">These courts in the period of Mubarak's authority served for the suppression of oppositionists.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the overthrow of dictator in the military conclusion they were found to 11,000 citizens.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also, as it is said in the project, state must guard “true essence of Egyptian family” and “support her morals and values”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Legally this is formulated so illegibly, that the public institutions with the aid of this article can control even content of cinema and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">By the plain text this indicates nothing else but censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Generally not one article establishes directly the equality of men and women.</seg>
<seg id="28">Then another forbids to oskorblyat and to defame the prophet of Mohammed and his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">But what is insult and as it must punish, it remains obscure.</seg>
<seg id="30">Formulation also seems doubtful that is forbidden “the insult of people”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Sufficiently whether it will be caricature to the President or jokes about the jurist?</seg>
<seg id="32">A question of interpretation as much in this project, which Morsi proposes to the signature and which, according to him, “very soon” will be presented to Egyptians in the referendum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">“Revolution returned”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Already several weeks is formed opposition against the superiority of Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tens of thousands of people were collected in the uncommon unanimity in the evening of Friday on Tahrir Square in Cairo and were vowed to destroy this document even before it will be able to come into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">“Revolution returned, and we will defeat”, said Khamdin Sabbakhi, that occupied the third place on the presidential elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former leader of international department for atomic energy Mohamed ElBaradei stated that to draft constitution place “on the dustbin of history”.</seg>
<seg id="38">Through the service of the short news of Twitter it accused the adherents of Morsi of the desire to head “coup against democracy”.</seg>
<seg id="39">“If it declares referendum, we will go to its palace and let us throw down it”, said the oppositionist of Yasser Said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">“We yet did not get tired, the blood of our brothers yet not of otmshchena”, cited the Egyptian mass media of oppositional politician Khaled Ali.</seg>
<seg id="41">Many judges also reported that they do not want to control referendum, which would make its ineffective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">“The Koran - our constitution”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The well organized “Muslim Brotherhood”, in turn, called to the opposite demonstration, but, from the precaution, not on Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on other shore of the Nile before the Cairo university.</seg>
<seg id="44">In it participated the large number of women under the covers and of the adherents of the Salafis, whom they shouted: “People requires the application of a God law”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">They required from Morsi: “Burdens the country!” and they certified: “The Koran - our constitution”.</seg>
<seg id="46">Power contest above the symbolic area, over which everything began, provoked the state of in practice Civil War.</seg>
<seg id="47">Morsi's followers, it is completely obviously, did not want to go to this risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">“The Muslim Brotherhood” stated that both the enemies and supporters of draft constitution expressed themselves loudly and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="49">Time now arrived to give to people to solve in the ballot-box, in what direction the country must go.</seg>
<seg id="50">Majorities for the project of Islamists, this is considered as the solved matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">“The concept “of human rights” is mentioned never”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Abu Saed's Khafiz in the fury from this forced constitutional process, which, in general, had to last until February with the participation of all public forces.</seg>
<seg id="53">48-year-old attorney on human rights and chairman of Egyptian organization for the rights of man (EOPR) protected “the Muslim Brotherhood”, when during Mubarak's lifetime they sat in the prison or appeared before the court.</seg>
<seg id="54">Not because it divided their world view, but because human rights for it were indivisible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">For this it was beaten, sentenced, arrested.</seg>
<seg id="56">But now words “human rights” never are encountered in the new constitution, will regret it in the conversation “Welt am of Sonntag”.</seg>
<seg id="57">The expansion of Morsi's influence on all three branches of authority in the state disappoints attorney.</seg>
<seg id="58">These measures are explicit impacts for democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to the new dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="59">“Instead of strengthening of civil state, the President de facto annulled him”, will regret Saeda.</seg>
<seg id="60">Indeed without the civil public organizations democracy cannot function.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Saeda feels, that everything they left its, even international community, which looks at the battle of ideas of directions on the Nile with the mixture of curiosity and stress.</seg>

<seg id="1">Norwegian rakfisk: the badly reeking fish itself in the world?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">In the pyatimillionnogo population of Norway one of the very high standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the entire world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Possibly, the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local predilection to one extremely fetid fish dish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take several gotten overripe pieces of cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">You will place them into the heap of dirty and sweaty sport clothing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leave them there to the week.</seg>
<seg id="7">In you will come out striking back sense of smell it smelled rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am situated in the small town by the name of Fagernes, three hours of ride from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">All around covered with snow picturesque forms. This is very beautiful, but in air ineradicable characteristic smell is spilled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk - this the trout, strewn I will pour off and wandered in the water up to the year, depending on that, what precisely musty smell it is necessary to attain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As they thicken twilights even it kholodaet in proportion to, the crowds of Norwegians are collected to the festival into Fagernese, dedicated to this very, let us say so, to the gripping dish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">“It they eat damp and wash down by the wineglass of aqua vitae, local caraway vodka”, explains Khavard Khalvarsen, local fireman on the profession and on the pluralism “rakfiskovyy General”, who leads conducting festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Everywhere around us people eat the cut with small cubes fish and wash down by its big enough portions of alcoholic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“Someone more pleases aqua vitae, than rakfisk”, says Khavard.</seg>
<seg id="15">This beverage is capable to smash smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I try the pair of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it will be possible to carry piece under the nose, then everything not too and badly - it differs little from the portion of land, which you for long conveyed with yourselves in the bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk - this is Norwegian product from completely different times, times of the poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish they in autumn wet in the hermetically sealed barrels with salt water.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then by the deep winter, when fish already and thoroughly wandered well, it they extracted and, after muting perception by alcohol, they used into the food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Even on the memory of past generation the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of the work and to emigrate, mainly, in the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Now population swiftly grows - more than 13% comprise the immigrants, whom the here jobs, high wages and developed system of social welfare draw.</seg>
<seg id="22">The inhabitants of Sweden (old rival, but yet not so long ago and much more prosperous neighbor) mass arrive here to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is received as the certain important symbol, indispensable, although a somewhat fetid element of the past of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is one of the most expensive local dishes.</seg>
<seg id="25">From the other side, here everything is dear - the small glass of beer or sandwich will manage to you into 9 of pounds sterling (14 US dollars).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway rarely appears in World News, and the majority of the inhabitants of the country is this it is, it seems, it arranges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">People, until now, unwillingly here mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and extremist of the right sense, which in the past year shot and the killed 77 men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Without mentioning its name, act of terror is called “happened on July 22”.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is very difficult to believe Norwegians, that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens proved to be capable to similar atrocities and murders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the basis of today's prosperity of Norway lies an increase (since the beginning of the seventieths) in one of the largest natural gas branches in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">“However oil - the not sole reason for our prosperity”, says Anna, our waitress, who resounds trays with that sustained rakfiskom, woman with the long bright hair and surprisingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic prosperity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are this people - as you call - reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="33">Like the majority of Norwegians, she wonderfully speaks in English.</seg>
<seg id="34">We do not love to be advanced on the showing, we are not boastful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway very with great care turns with its oil - the large part of the incomes of natural gas branch is invested into the special fund, created for the good of the future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the years, which preceded the world financial crisis, when all littered by the money, which did not have they, Norway thrifty calculated all expenditures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">“Thus far it is possible to be rolled on skis to in winter and walk into the marches in summer, this it is sufficient for the happiness”, says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">“There is rakfisk”, it adds with the lighthearted laughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I cost in snow in the turn for any by food - rakfiska from me will be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="40">Here is hamburger with the losinym meat - this is already accurate exotic character, tasty juicy meat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening us waits an even larger quantity all of the same fish with the unforgettable smell.</seg>
<seg id="42">In my hotel are carried out special supper, dedicated rakfisk, in course of which the visitors determine the best or, possibly, most fragrant fish by voting.</seg>
<seg id="43">Goes the straight television broadcasting, in which shows that leading in the necktie-butterfly, surrounded by plates rakfiskom.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is similar to the song competition “Eurovision”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“Thus, Thor-Jurgen, what estimation you placed for the best fish there in yourselves mountains?”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">“Yes, Khavard, here is our estimation”….</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">All laugh and applaud.</seg>
<seg id="48">Someone falls from the chair having, possibly, sorted out of aqua vitae.</seg>
<seg id="49">But can, simply nadyshavshis by the smell of this fish.</seg>

<seg id="11">Before such statements next to the President of the USA the political career of Mr. Pena Neto was developed at the post of the governor of his native state of Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="12">On its native land, in the densely populated and extensive state, which surrounds the capital of the country, the opinions about the new leader were divided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Rectilinear person</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the idyllic town Vale-de-bravo, for example, about it they recall with the heat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Inhabitants place the reanimation of tourism, development of health resort sphere and creation of infrastructure to it in the merit.</seg>
<seg id="16">The city it is possible to reach on one of the new highway, built with G Pena Neto, which striking differ from roads with the dents and pits, which were earlier at this place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Tables with its name hang on the contemporary building of sport center and on the impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate changes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">“We connect with it hopes for real and serious changes”, says its friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the Congressman of state from that headed Pena Neto of institution-revolutionary party (PRI).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We is expected the present and decisive changes, which are so acutely necessary for our country, first of all in the region of safety and economic development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 a continuous stay at the authority party PRI was extruded in 2000 by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Olvera recognizes that after his 12 summer absences in the presidential palace of Los-Pinos the party lays large hopes for Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">Furthermore, it refutes charges in the emptiness, which advanced to the new President the opposition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It is very straight-line and it is very devoted to the matter of the embodiment of its vision of country future.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is excellent statesman, and, first of all, person, who knows how to listen to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But in another part of the state in many people another idea about the former governor was formed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The municipality of Nesaualkoyotl, known also by the name Ciudad-Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the paved streets Vale-de-bravo.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hidden under the overpasses of highways, it in many senses is the suburb of Mexico City itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And problems in the municipality also bear the severe nature of this megapolis.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is earlier in this year for the suppression of gangs, which trade in narcotics in these regions, were drawn the troops; and violence in the attitude of women bears here especially sharp nature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Several ten bodies of the killed women in last two years was only discovered on the vacant land near the extensive dump.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than thousand women was killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Pena Neto - this considerably exceeds a similar index in the sadly become famous by violence city Ciudad-Juarez, whose name became nominal, when the discussion turns to the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">According to the opponents of Mr. Pena Neto, about it at best it is possible to say that in the time of its stay at the post of governor it did not know how to manage the problem of the murder of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, in the worst case they charge its administration with the complete ignoring of this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The inhabitant of the concrete house, similar to the majority of houses in this decrepit region, Irineus Buendiya with difficulty holds in control tears, showing to me the photographs of its deceased daughter the Marian the Moon.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version Marian in 2010 completed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, its family considers that its room-mate killed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">“When I reached its house, it was it seems that its body before this they washed out”, recalls the Mrs. of Buendiya.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were the signs of the fact that they beat up it, and body is already stiff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Mother the Marian retells this history, and the portrait of daughter he looks on us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, on which is traced only one word: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">Specifically, in this, according to them, it was refused to this family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">“The officials of state turned themselves with me as with the old gossiper, dissatisfied narushitelnitsey of calmness.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want so that the people simply would assume upon the faith everything that they speak, and they held the tongue.</seg>
<seg id="43">But this is incorrect, so it is cannot, in particular when around so there are many disturbances and shortages”, she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">After putting on presidential crossbelt on Saturday, President Pena Neto together with it will take upon himself difficult responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the last six years tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected the crimes, connected with the violence, and the new President promised to make a solution of this problem to priority during his administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">“I hope that it will be accurately the same President, such as he was governor”, says Olvera, Congressman from Vale-de-bravo from the party PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, precisely this they most of all fear the family of victims into Ciudad-Nesa.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">During the cross examination at the dosudebnom hearing in the Fort-Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the state of Maryland, the judge advocate Major Eshden Feyn stated that the records of the weekly visits of Menninga by the administration officials of prison for nine months of his content into Kvantiko, state Virginia, do not contain complaints of the bad treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The reports examined do not contain complaints of the bad treatment, in spite of the fact that Menninga directly asked about the conditions of its content, asserts Feyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Menning answered, that it expressed oral apprehension by these problems and, that its attended administration officials discussed with it these problems and declared, that by them they will study, but they did not fix this in the written form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">“They wrote “problems they are absent” (after the consideration of my complaints), but this does not mean that I did not raise this theme in the conversation”, says Menning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Military judge, Colonel Deniz Linda, also asked Menninga, why that did not complain about the incorrect rotation with it in January 2011 during the session of the commission, which examined the suicidal intentions, which it expressed in the written form for several months to that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Menning answered, that he wanted to attain during that session so that from it they would remove the regime “of warning of traumatism” and would soften the conditions of conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="20">The representatives of military management explained, what limited regime of conclusion - to the level is lower than the regime of supervision for the purpose of averting suicide - it was introduced for the protection of prisoner, and also for the safety of others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">“I wanted to give to know administrations that with me all in the order, so that they would cancel the regime of warning traumatism… so that the level of my life it would be improved, from my point of view”, explained Menning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On Thursday Menning testified about its arrest in Iraq and transfer in Kuwait, where him they contained almost two months they before transferred into the prison on the Naval base into Kvantiko, state of Virginia, in July 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It reported that the thoughts about the suicide appeared in its Kuwait, and that once it lost consciousness because of the strong heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">It explained, which is psychologically very heavy, when to you they do not give to know, as your lot is solved, and which occurs in the external world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">“My peace was pressed to the base camp-Arifzhan, to the dimensions of my prison, said Menning on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26"> - I thought that I will die in this cell”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Being located into Kvantiko, Menning, according to him, carried out the large part of the time in the small camera - at least 21 hour, and often even it is more than 23 hours in a 24 hour period - in the complete solitude.</seg>
<seg id="28">Menning reports that it they permitted to leave only mattress, blanket, shlepantsy, several objects of clothing and glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">He indicates that he tried to move, since to sleep or even simply to lie in the day time forbade rules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">According to Menninga, during the sleep the eyes to it constantly struck the light, which penetrates outside the camera.</seg>
<seg id="31">If guards did not see its face, when it was turned over in the bed at night, then, according to him, it they woke and made it necessary to overturn to the back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Attorney Menninga gave the official objection apropos of incorrect rotation with Menningom in January 2011.</seg>
<seg id="33">In April 2011 Menninga transferred into the military prison into the fort-Livenvort, state of Kansas.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="36">Answering questions of judge on Friday, Menning said that he understood from the order of guard that must throw the blanket, by which it could be covered, but it recognized that no one directly ordered it to throw it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On Thursday Menning stated that it they the previous night forced to sleep by naked because of its attempt to show officer that it does not present danger for itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Menning reported that it said to officer that it could use elastic of cowards or shlepantsy in order to traumatize itself, but it did not make this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">By that night, according to the evidence of Menninga, its underwear, shlepantsy and glasses took away from the camera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Its attorneys hope that the judge, at least, will consider that the fact that for it was necessary to survive during the conclusion, and substantially will reduce the period of conclusion, if Menning will be acknowledged by the guilty military court, which must begin the examination of its matter at the beginning of the following year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Protection she stated that it plans to propose Menningu to recognize fault for the less serious crimes, and other charges to dispute as excessive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The renewal of hearings is planned to these output, it is expected that the side of charge will insist on what content conditions were under arrest justified.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon asserts that Menning was contained into Kvantiko in accordance with the rules, which regulate the content of prisoners with a maximally strict regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Among the charges, advanced to Menningu, are complicity to enemy, the illegal assistance to promulgation of data in the Internet, the transmission of the information, which is concerned national defense, and theft of the government ownership or documents.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination - story of the American of Mexican origin.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the opinion of the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the absence of the opportunities to realize themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans are inclined to blame those, who left, because they remind the inhabitants of the country about the complex times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben Navarette considers that the Mexicans of American origin are torn up between two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">I passed along the corridor for those arriving, approached the zone of border control and am chilled on the spot during the recent trip to Mexico City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs indicated two turns: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I several seconds stood before them, without knowing, where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew in central California, and me entire life was called Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="9">This simply code name, similarly, as my friends in Boston are called themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I stopped at the complex construction “American of Mexican origin”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, on the native land of my grandfather, there was no need in the code names or complex constructions.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simple American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak in Spanish sufficiently well in order to pose questions or to answer on them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my lexical reserve is poorer than in the carriers of language, and I cannot get rid of the American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Therefore I reached my American passport and he became in the turn for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I recalled this history several days ago, when the newly selected President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda they stood questions customary for the encounters of the Presidents of these countries: immigration, narcotics and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">President Pena Neto willingly spoke about the upsurge of the Mexican economy, therefore the Mexicans now, equally well, can remain in Mexico, instead of move into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to conclude the agreement about the partnership with the USA and Canada and to create certain North American commercial block like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">Furthermore, President Pena Neto promised to continue war against the narkokarteley in Mexico; however, no specific proposals it sounded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico relation with the United States - heavy and completed old offences question.</seg>
<seg id="23">The majorities of Americans never thought about the fact that the in 1848 United States it invaded Mexico and under the muzzle of rifles they forced its leaders to forego half of their territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Mexicans think by centuries, but not by minutes, and reminders about those events in everything see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore it is worth to only any statesman of the USA mention although by the word of criticism to the side of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society here are heard complaint about the fact that the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants of Montesumy fill by militancy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In this case most complex appear the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin, that live in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do want to have a talk about the offences?</seg>
<seg id="29">It is sufficient them.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico are winners and lost, the people, which find in this country for themselves of opportunity, and those, there are no such opportunities for whom.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so there are many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: at some moment of their family history someone - father or grandfather - did not have an opportunity to realize itself in Mexico and it was forced to leave for the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most frequently these were Mexicans of the specific type - dark-comlexioned, poorly educated, from the poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We their descendants, and we remember about this.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico this they see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today our life - this embodiment of American dream, we learned in good schools and were arranged to good works, but to us not to forget that even this dream - American, and not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination is tangled and it is unclear, but we know, what country to consider its.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">We know moreover that the majority of the representatives of Mexican elite and ruling class do not love us.</seg>
<seg id="39">We answer them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see in us reminding about the humiliating defeats and relate to us as to the people of the second type as to the false Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We insufficiently speak well in Spanish, and our connections with Mexico are insufficiently strong.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our existence itself for them is explained by failures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors would succeed in Mexico, they did not leave.</seg>
<seg id="44">We would not prove to be now after the silk curtain, after finding in the USA satisfied life, but after losing spiritual connections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the USA even in the childhood, and this reminds me about the fact that between the real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there are specific frictions - Mexicans more clearly understand their national identity, and to the Americans of Mexican origin this is offensive.</seg>
<seg id="46">It the citizen of the USA considers that it belongs to both countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time many my familiar Americans of Mexican origin feel belonging not with one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstina.</seg>
<seg id="49">Obtaining best of two peace, you unavoidably lose roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we are Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">But in the USA they call us Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I explained during my trip, as if our relations without that are insufficiently tangled, some Mexican leaders and representatives of intelligentsia want to restore relations with the diaspore.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want so that the Americans of Mexican origin would work their kind as the ambassadors of Mexico and would be of its interests to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could describe to our friend-Americans about which this excellent country and as is healthy her to attend, and could convince political leaders to strengthen connections with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Aha, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing it will leave.</seg>
<seg id="57">There are too many offences in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">But taking into account the break between the rich and poor, the revelry of corruption and narcotics trafficking, many of us do not completely consider this country of such already excellent.</seg>
<seg id="59">You will excuse, but be investigated with this themselves, amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And this is correct.</seg>
<seg id="61">If the part of the Mexicans, until now, cannot forgive to the United States first, as they entered with Mexico one-and-a-half century ago, to them it is necessary to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin still in the offence for that, as very recently in Mexico they managed with their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes already.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps, it is more general, than me it seemed.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old battles in the new Near East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Cease-fire agreement between Israel and group Hamas can become brittle foundation for further peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Is possible lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Near East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sequential round of bloodshed pushes slightly to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound, the become with customary, senseless disputes about that, who the first of beginnings; many buildings they are converted into the ruins; are killed more than 140 Palestinians, majority of whom composed citizens, and six Israelis; for the first time in the time of conflict, released from the territory throttle controls rockets fell in the environments of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and Holy City of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, in spite of the fact that Israelis and Palestinians is hopeless of uvyazli in its age long conflict, in the Near East arrived the changes.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is possible to relate differently to this; however, the events “Arab spring” turned in rebellious borax many kept balance realia, and for Palestinians with Israelis could not be remain beside the vortex, which shook region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Possibly, as a result, their fight will become even bloodier than earlier.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons, which give hope for output from this fatal impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">War without the winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The at first glance prevailing situation does not give occasions for the optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if cease fire, agreement about which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, collisions occurred on this week only strengthened the positions of power figures from both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Leaders of Islamic movement Hamas, that arrived at the authority in the Gaza Strip in 2007; will state from that they forced Israel to step back, in spite of the carried by them losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">In spite of the fact that some leaders of group were destroyed, and 1.7 million inhabitants were blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel did not succeed in destroying Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In reality Hamas increases its popularity on the West Bank of river Jordan - one additional Palestinian territory, controlled at present by the more moderate motion FATEH.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, leaders Hamas completely can come to the conclusion that the time works on them.</seg>
<seg id="17">In proportion to an increase in the influence of Islamic motions in the Arab world in Hamas appear new influential and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reviving himself regional leader Turkey, which was once the nearest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, came out with the support Hamas; its example followed Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">The triumphant supporters Hamas declare about the creation around Israel of Islamic demilune - from Lebanon on the north, in which guides the militarized group the Hezbollah, to Syria, in which ever more proislamistskie rebels is any minute now thrown down authority Bashar Assada, and further to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten Royal power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A significant change of the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where during President Mukhammede Mursi's lifetime was strengthened the influence of motion the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, who guided by Egypt for 30 years and it was thrown down in 2011; was secular dictator, who did not pay special attention to support Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Muslim Brotherhood are, on the contrary, the organization, in many respects similar Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the future diplomatic arrangements Hamas can become the significant player, whose voice will not succeed in muffling even Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time the supporters “rigid” line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the military sense Hamas was devastated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Israeli antimissile system “iron cupola” justified expenditures for its creation and successfully destroyed many of that neglected Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">The citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least some time.</seg>
<seg id="28">Concerning diplomacy, the USA they remained accurate to their constant position; many European Countries also laid fault for the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">One additional important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, in particular with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who to a considerable degree ignored peaceful process.</seg>
<seg id="30">In spite of the fact that since 2004. approximately 30 Israelis died from the rockets, released from the territory of throttle control, Israel succeeded in reducing to a minimum the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which goes to the territory of the West Bank of river Jordan - the substantial part of the unacknowledged Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to be enlarged in spite of the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international legislation.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party the Likud - within the framework of the preparation for the outlined on January 22 selections - was combined with even the more aggressive disposed conservatives under the government of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.</seg>
<seg id="32">What sense to show indulgence to Palestinians and to give to them her own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If we return into their hands entire authority in the territory of West Bank, will not begin they to start from there rockets to the side of Israel, as do make their fellows in the Gaza Strip?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to hold them after the wall and it is rigid to suppress any attempts to raise heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Possibly, the supporters “rigid” line will gain victory; however, their calculations can be disproved by Arab spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">With the fact that the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, experience the not warmest feelings to Israel, internal problems will become their priority task.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense part of the budget of Israel is greater than in all its Arab neighbors, together.</seg>
<seg id="38">Unleashing war with the regional super-power will hardly help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked at cease fire, is a good sign and can mark with itself the beginning of changes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australia entered the force the law about the standardized packing for cigarette.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Warnings about the harm of smoking and image of the struck by diseases body parts contrastingly are separated on the sad green boxes, identical for all stamps cigarette.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">_first in world practice Australian law about uniform packing cigarette also tobacco article come into force v silu, substitute logotype and colored formulation different stamp identical box sad-olive color with terrible photograph struck disease body part tela and image child, health which blow up smoking their parent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Besides the different pictures and inscriptions, which warn about the harm of smoking, the only difference between the bundles, introduced in the required order from this Saturday - the name stamps, which are printed by identical small type.</seg>
<seg id="5">These are the most severe in the world conditions for the formulation of the packings of tobacco articles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Federal Government of Australia declares, that the purpose of this measure - to hold young people from smoking, depriving this addiction of fashionable status.</seg>
<seg id="7">The results of the studies, which showed, lay as the basis of this solution that people, which did not begin to smoke of up to 26 years, in 99 cases of 100 so never and become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">“It is obvious that even at the youngest age the children understand the sense, which they attempt to report tobacco companies with the aid of the formulation of packing”, explains the minister of public health Tanya Plibersek, referring to the studies, which showed that, for example, the crown in the logotype is associated in children with the idea of princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the smallest in the world portion of smokers, so that these changes especially will not affect the profits of transnational corporations; however, the opportunity of adopting the such measures already examine other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The representatives of tobacco industry intensely counteracted the adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies assert that this will only increase the portion of the Black Market, on which will be sold cheap and accessible cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">“This law will lead to the serious consequences, different from those, which thought by its initiators”, counts Scott Makintayr, the representative of the company of British American Tobacco in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The producers of false production of China and Indonesia will supply much more than such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to an increase in the business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha from the small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd asserts that the demand for the cigarette cases and silicone cases, which hide unpleasant pictures on the packing, swiftly grew (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip of Morris and Japan Tobacco they lost the matter in the high court of Australia, where they attempted to appeal this law.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the Sandra ha, the company of Zico already realized the order of six thousand articles to the enterprises of wholesale trade and it expects new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a good business for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Potential interference for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely that part of the population, toward which are directed these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the adoption in Australia of a number of the laws, which made illegal television advertisement cigarette and the support by them of sport measures, and forbidding to salesmen to also advance cigarettes in sight place, the advertisement of tobacco articles moved into the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The government of Australia forbade to domestic firms and Web sites to place advertisement in the network, but it cannot limit foreign sites in this.</seg>
<seg id="21">“If you deal in tobacco articles and in you only this small hole remained, the idea to move their goods in the Internet will seem you by extremely tempting”, explains Beki Freeman, that investigates questions of public health at the university of sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of the trade marks, written from the person allegedly of usual users, in such social networks as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">Does arise question - is actual whether this affair of the hands of the series citizen, who does so love the cigarettes of Marlboro that it was not sorry forces and time and did make a videotape, or after this does stand advertising company?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Australian department of the company of British American Tobacco asserts that in the branch it is now more greatly occupied with adaptation to the new rules, than by advertisement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The representatives of tobacco industry send even to such measures as the sponsoring of Ukraine, honduras and of Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states present claim within the framework of the World Trade Organization, declaring about the fact that the trade underwent by wrong limitations, in spite of the fact that the commercial relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="26">The resolution of the WTO (World Trade Organization) is expected to the middle of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the opportunity of adopting by them the similar laws about the packing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001 Canada of the first introduced the required arrangement of the photographs, which warn about the harm of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now this rule is accepted in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The opportunity of the stiffening of laws is examined in Great Britain, New Zealand, Republic of South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many smokers in Australia they do not demonstratively obey to innovations.</seg>
<seg id="32">These pictures do not catch me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I simply do not turn attention.</seg>
<seg id="34">“Simply you snatch out to cigarette and hide bundle into the pocket”, explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with the photograph of the tumor of oral cavity on the bundle.</seg>
<seg id="35">Honestly speaking, only, what can force me to throw - this is my small daughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, who manages by the store of the tobacco articles of King of the Pack in the center of sydney, asserts that the identical packing complicated the task of the arrangement of goods on the regiments</seg>
<seg id="37">“Earlier in me for unloading of new party departed hour, and now four hours”, it complains.</seg>
<seg id="38">“Government it was necessary to take and to entirely forbid cigarettes, we then said: however, which to make, is agreeable, everything is ended, we shut store”, he says, throwing up hands upward.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">To be bored in the world electronic networks and constant connections - this is not so already and it is bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">During this day of gratitude for me unexpectedly it was necessary to conduct five hours in the airport, because mechanical troubles were revealed in our aircraft and they replaced it with another aircraft, which we waited until.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, i had sufficient time for the reflections about nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not deceive you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Noon in the airport in the expectation of voyage - this is actually boring, and here strongly will not help neither books nor periodicals nor iPhone nor even stores of duty-free trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, recently increasingly more scientists and specialists for the children's development speak out in favor boredoms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They indicate that in the specific situations for us and for our children to be bored not too and it is bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">This forces the brain to be distracted on the interesting adjacent themes, which, possibly, contributes to creation.</seg>
<seg id="9">But since in modern world we all constantly are situated before any screen, the advantages of boredom are passed by us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It can be we should approach boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time no.</seg>
<seg id="13">We still will return to this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Is earlier I, as many, she considered that boredom - invention relative to the recent times, when in people more than free time appeared.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is not so, asserts Peter Tui, the professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian university of Calgary, the author of the book “captivating history of boredom” (Boredom: A of Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“In reality boredom can brag of very ancient history”, he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Latin inscriptions about the boredom, dated by the first century, are discovered on the walls in the Pompeys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In this case remains open a question about how we understand boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">Problem in that, speaks John d. Eastwood, the associate professor of university York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom frequently changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After studying the materials of experiments on this theme and after presenting the question to task force into 100 people, professor Eastwood and his colleagues arrived at the following definition: boredom - this when people “want, but they cannot be occupied by the fact that would bring to them the satisfaction”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between the boredom and apathy, he speaks, it consists in the fact that the being bored person does not make something, that he would want to make.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nothing to make it is desirable with the apathy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Basic in the survived boredom, he speaks, this “disturbance of attention and connected with this worsening in the mood and the sensation of the fact that the time is pulled slowly”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">According to the description the boredom can seem by very similar to depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, professor Eastwood asserts that in spite of the possible connection between these states, the being bored people see the reasons for problems in surrounding peace and circumstances, and people, which survive depression, see problems in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">It sometimes us seems that to us it is boring, when in reality to us it is simply difficult on by something to be concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its study “the unoccupied reason: the determination of boredom from the point of view of attention”, published in September release of the periodical of Perspectives on of Psychological Science, professor Eastwood with the colleagues refer to the carried out earlier experiment, whose participants listened to the record of the voice, which reads periodical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants heard also the loud sounds of the not relating to the matter tv program, switched on in the adjacent room, others heard the same sounds on the low of loudness, so that hardly it was possible to dismantle them, but the third group listened to only the record of voice without the outside sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants, who heard television with the low level of loudness, they noted that it was boring, more frequent than others - it was difficult to be concentrated, but they did not know the reason for this and assigned this to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we attempt to concentrate attention in the difficult or captivating task, the interruption of attention can cause boredom, speaks Mark J. of Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the university of Gvelfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of this investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">From the other side, when we make anything uninteresting, “for example, scrutinizing into the flow of articles on the conveyor in the search for marriage, the distracting music can help to avoid boredom”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is considered, it continues, that when people begin to rock on the chair or to sketch astrakmans on the sheet of paper, they make this from the boredom; however, now we know that in reality such actions simply help not to weaken physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">“A study showed that the children, to which they do not forbid to fidget and to be twirled, learn better and memorize more information, than the children, whom they require to sit quietly”, asserts professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">At some moments we all experience the boredom: with the delay of voyage (as in my case), listening to monotonic speech, examining uninteresting film.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, different people demonstrate the different degree of tendency toward the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980's years for measuring such specific features the researchers developed the special “scale of tendency toward the boredom”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">For determining the estimation according to this scale are used questions and assertions, for example, “much of the fact that for me is necessary to make, monotonous and monotonically” or “to me too much is interesting; therefore not to that time is sufficient”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The researchers determined with the aid of such questionnaires, that the boys are bored more frequent than girls, says Steven Vodanovich, the professor of psychology at the university of West Florida, in particular with the presence of diverse external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, as a whole adolescents generally frequently are bored.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991. Reed Larson, the professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted the experiment, in course of which he was connected with the aid of the pager almost with 400 adolescents and their parents of 7-8 times in the day.</seg>
<seg id="41">It obtained the following results: 32% of adolescents stated, that by them is boring in the school and during the fulfillment of domestic target, and 23% stated, that by them is boring beyond the limits of school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In this case only 3% of parents noted that by them it is boring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson notes that he does not have data about which would be similar data about the boredom now, 21 year later.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, he knows that “to the teenage period is fallen the peak of tendency toward the boredom”, in essence because to children and for adolescents they do not make possible entirely to decide how it to study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Let us return to my initial question: boredom is useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes no, because in the extreme manifestations it, as show studies, can push slightly people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky games of chance or abuse of the specific substances in the attempts to get rid of the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">From the other side, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between the boredom and creation, speaks professor Vodanovich, who dedicated to the study of this problem of more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">“So our brain prompts to us that it follows to study something other; this is boredom”, tell in Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the New York university.</seg>
<seg id="49">However, this brain itself does not always know how precisely it is better to study.</seg>
<seg id="50">If to you it will be boring and you will direct this energy toward the game on the guitar or culinary experiences, you will make to yourselves better.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you will begin to watch TV, they will become better only to some period, and soon this it will pass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Therefore, if your child is bored and you give to it iPad, it will cease to be bored; however, it will not learn to fight with the boredom independently or by somehow other method to govern its time and employment, says professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">“A such habits of independent regulation are engaged in the most different situations”, it asserts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child learns not only to independently occupy himself something, he also learns self-control generally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that the boredom must be somehow extolled.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, to consider it its something poor also does not stand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rather one should learn to feel itself comfortably even out of the continuous flow of actions and technologies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood is agreeable with this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">“We see this so that we should more frequently experience boredom, with the fact that boredom - this extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to study something that comprehended”, he, says.</seg>
<seg id="60">In reality people attempt somehow to be turned off from constant concerns and it is simple to be weakened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">“In modern world we became accustomed to a constant excessive stimulation of sensory organs, he says, and when it begins silence, we are lost even we do not know what to make”.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Is thus far incomprehensibly as will be used new law about the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">By Anthony Orosko, the nineteenth-year player of football team and student of community college on the southeast of the state of Colorado is accused of the accomplishment of the criminal offense, which is consisted in the fact that will be soon completely lawful in the entire territory of the state: storage of the small portion of marijuana and tube, in which it smoked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. Orosko says that once in September he with the friends was in Lamare and he went in the automobile on the prairie near the boundary with Kansas, when policemen stopped them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After policeman it revealed in the machine marijuana, to Mr. Orosko arrived agenda into the court for the storage of narcotics and ownership of adaptation for the use of the narcotics - small offenses, for each of which is due penalty in the size of 100 dollars - and is assigned the date of judicial session.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“With us they turn as with the criminals”, says Mr. Orosko.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But criminal whether it?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty, which continues already several weeks after the state of Colorado it voted for the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for the entertainment, solution of hundreds of small judicial matters depends not so much on law, as from the place of examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Charges in the small offenses, connected with marijuana, has already been removed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which took similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations already ended to advance charges to people at age 21 of year and it is older for the storage of small doses, which will begin to be considered legal, as soon as through the pair of weeks law will come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, in the more conservative regions of Colorado accusers made the decision to examine the existing matters, connected with marijuana, and on the previous they assign on the responsibility for storage of this narcotic.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain regions of the West they vote for that in order not to allow appearance in their places of the new, licensed by state stores on sale of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">“All this is developed so swiftly, that I even do not know, what to wait further”, say Daniel J. of Outs, chief of the police in the town aurora to the east of from Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The representatives of controlling bodies in Washington State also puzzled scratch heads.</seg>
<seg id="14">For them one must form rules for determining the order of the licensing of cultivation, working, propagation and sale of marijuana, and all this must be made until December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They indicate that Colorado, good this or is bad, anticipates the majority of other states in regulating of questions of the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for the entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“In Colorado the more regulated market; therefore they will serve as good example”, explain Brian I. Smith, representative of council for the regulation of production and sale of alcoholic production in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now no one can make more, recognizes Mr. Smith how to advance some propositions and to hope that this he will operate.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We do not have present precedent, to which we could be oriented”, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The bill of Washington State, named is i-th-502, it will come into force on December 6 and for entire year will plunge state into the state of the uncertainty, when there are no systems of state licensing still, and the right of the ownership of marijuana is already legalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">But there are indeed even more complex technical aspects, which it is necessary to decide during this period, for example, how to find the equilibrium between the order of state about “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with the prohibition to the trade in it at a distance of 1000 feet from the schools, parks, playing fields and kindergartens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">“It is especially complicated it will be complicated to locate the licensed enterprises for trade in marijuana within the boundaries of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs”, explain Ben Livingston, representative of the recently created research group “the center of the legalization of marijuana”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21 the chief of the police of Outs from the aurora sent out to his subordinate on the electronic mail communication, that the prosecutor's office of city more will not assign those, who reached age 21 year, on the responsibility for the ownership of a small quantity of marijuana, and that the police ceases to seize people in the given disturbances “from this time on”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The chief of the police of Outs reported that the police will follow the observance in the city of the rules, which regulate the activity of those, who rear marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal merchants and spreaders of narcotics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The attorney of Ueld region on the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a stricter approach to this question.</seg>
<seg id="25">After voting on the bill he stated that the prosecutor's office will as before assign on the responsibility for the ownership of marijuana, mainly in order to impel its using persons to pass the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the given moment for 119 persons are produced the charges in storage of two and less than the ounces of marijuana, although many of them are charged also with other disturbances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">“The responsibility of our establishment - to pursue for the actions, which are considered criminal at the moment of their accomplishment”, said Mr. Bak in his statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Reaction was ambiguous even in such places as the rural region of Mesa, where participants in the voting rejected proposal about the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police the grandee of Junction, largest city in the region, no longer assigns on the responsibility of adult for the ownership of a small quantity of narcotic.</seg>
<seg id="30">District attorney Pit Khauttsinger supported this solution, but also he decided not to remove charges in the already open matters, connected with the storage of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">“I consider what to ensure the observance of law until it changes - our straight responsibility”, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In spite of the fact that 55% of inhabitants of the state of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported this solution, the start of questions of the use of marijuana for the entertainments into the state and legal system will not be simple.</seg>
<seg id="33">But the contradictory reaction of inhabitants in the different places of state bared the ambiguity of the ratio of local authorities to the experiment of state with marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">“In district attorneys in this question there is a cultural barrier”, explains Sean Makalister, denverskiy attorney, who is of interests of those condemned for the storage of marijuana, and local representative of the national organization of the reformation of laws on marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">“They so for long pursued people for this, that now they cannot properly be subdued with the fact that this no longer crime”, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and to Washington - to first states, in which to a small quantity of marijuana they relate, just as to alcohol - it is judged to become experimental field on scales of the country for checking the very idea of the legalization of narcotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">The supporters of legalization and officials of state plan to enlarge the territory of the legalizovannoy trade, but at the same time they cautiously wait indications from federal of the authorities, which as before plan to consider sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The supporters of the legalization of marijuana hope that the administration of justice will yield in this question.</seg>
<seg id="39">In spite of several received wide resonance arrests of merchants and patients, who used marijuana from the medical indications, the Federal Government in the majority of the cases gave good in trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The agents of bureaus for fight with the narcotics will be hardly dug in into the houses in order to confiscate the small small packet of marijuana; however, they hardly they will begin to shut eyes to the adjusted by state government stores of recreational marijuana, which are permitted according to the new law, counts Kevin A. Sabet, the former adviser on questions of fight with the narcotics in Obama's administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some cities in Colorado did not begin to wait until the actions of federal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even to the presidential elections some local administrations approved moratorium for the discovery of new stores on sale of marijuana, which so could not be opened earlier than in year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week Montrouz, city in the Western part of the state, advanced for the examination the six months old prohibition in trade in marijuana, which, in all likelihood, will be approved on the following week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">“We do not want to prove to be in such position that we will give out license to someone, but then this will cause serious problems at the federal level”, say Bob Nickolson, member of town council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against this correction.</seg>
<seg id="46">And contradiction between the results of local voting and fact is now present, for which the state voted.</seg>
<seg id="47">Still many unresolved questions remain.</seg>

<seg id="5">And nevertheless, after two weeks of studies in the historical department of the Vusterskogo college of oxford university at the end of the eightieths, I gathered trunks and left, which took the shape of a first present scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father did not maintain and began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="7">Friends were biased to sense.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper of The Evening Standard asserted that I threw college, because it was not pleased to me, that my classmates deal with sex in the adjacent room.</seg>
<seg id="9">Writer E. Norman Wilson joked, that I left, because for me it was necessary to drink out of the pock-marked cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In reality everything was not so amusingly.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran out.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, it ran out, because they systematically hunted and intimidated me.</seg>
<seg id="13">Entirely not because of my sufficiently uncommon name or the fact that I learned in the private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">Me was hunted only for one reason, and in this renowned cradle of culture this appeared by present barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Vudro Uayett, was the well-known adviser of Margaret Thatcher, and I itself was the supporter of conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">But you will ask, why to recall about this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to last data, the new generation of students, which is adhered to right-centrist views, undergoes the same hunting.</seg>
<seg id="17">This institutsionalizirovannaya and constantly growing hatred for the student-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week the group of such students required the same protection of its rights as that, which is allowed to invalids, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservatives from the student club of college the group of Christy in Cambridge declare, that them “they frequently actively insulate, they subject to personal attacks and they force to feel themselves by the nezhelannymi guests” because of their political views.</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to introduce into the committee on the equal rights of the college of additional representative in order to ensure freedom of expression of its opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation only aggravated left recently on BBC 2 documentary film about the policy among students “the country of the miracles: young, clever and right”, in which conservatives they represented by cams and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the film were shown Joe Cook, former President of the association of the conservatives of the oxford university, which drives in the Rolls-Royce, bears silver suit and cane with the silver knob.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities the student-conservatives complain, that of them make “the scapegoats because of an increase in the pay for the studies”.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hatchway Black, 20 years, the Vice President of the association of the conservatives of the Nottingemskogo university, in an interview for one of the Sunday newspapers said that “in the university medium increases the misalignment to the side of left views.</seg>
<seg id="24">People, which us even do not know, previously consider us the insolent and with impunity violent children of rich parents”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Semyuel Roberts, 21 year, the student of the historical department of college the group of Christy, in which was given the application about strengthening of protection, calls this atmosphere “of cheerless”, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new President of the association of the conservatives of oxford university, he indicates that the ratio of members of student club to the carriers of right-centrist views considerably deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="26">“This is threat both for the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and it is simple for the normal life of members of club”, she, says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first several weeks in Oxford I was not simple in the minority, I was one.</seg>
<seg id="28">I entered there in September 1986, by a timid and shy eighteen-year old girl.</seg>
<seg id="29">Oxford it ran a fever from the hatred for the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the year to this university by voting it deprived the former student of Margaret Thatcher of her honorable degree because of the reduction of the budget allocations for higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this atmosphere it would be uncomfortably even stalinistam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">During the first days of the week of the freshman, when students become acquainted with each other and with the instructors, I for the first time perceived that it waited me in front.</seg>
<seg id="33">I yet did not know that the instructors not only looked through the fingers at the hunting of student-conservatives, but also themselves with the pleasure participated in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political questions - strike of miners, privatization and the disagreement of government to use sanctions against the government of apartheid in Republic of South Africa - penetrated through the sheathed by wooden panels walls of audiences.</seg>
<seg id="35">At my first seminar for I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century in the English, and I was not ready for the fact that followed this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">“Miss Uayett, said instructor, now deceased Harry Pitt, if you please, transfer the first paragraph”.</seg>
<seg id="37">Text was given to me with difficulty, I hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="38">Harry Pitt was very bilious person with face, similar to the cake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">“Tetcheristy principally they do not teach French or to them simply the brains are not sufficient?” - it asked.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other students of zakhikhikali.</seg>
<seg id="41">In me on the eyes the tears came out.</seg>
<seg id="42">“I advise you to take several initial lessons of French in the free time, if you, of course, are not very occupied, revolving in the society”, probryuzzhal Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned to my room of completely unhappy.</seg>
<seg id="44">In that evening in the college I sat at dinner one; then someone slapped me on the arm.</seg>
<seg id="45">This were James, student of the second course from the department of English, which was represented as the member of the association of the conservatives of university.</seg>
<seg id="46">“I know who you, he said friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> - Unfortunately, matter is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">above each, whom they suspect of the sympathy to the conservatives, they will jeer.</seg>
<seg id="49">To me very it is not easy, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore to you it will be more complexly.</seg>
<seg id="50">The majorities of freshman-conservatives are shut, that they are laborists”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is later, in the local pub, I in a cowardly manner attempted to play the hypocrite.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted on what it was agreeable not with all, which tells in Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">Craftiness did not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="54">The freshman of the department of philosophy, policy and economy, which itself learned in Eaton, he said: “You is the daughter of Fascist pig.</seg>
<seg id="55">You infectious”.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students caught its words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was damaged, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">“As conservatives they are occupied by sex? - Asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> - They strike each other, truth?”</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt itself in the manner that homosexuals to the cancellation of criminal prosecution in the Sixties probably felt themselves.</seg>
<seg id="61">Can I sometimes live normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">But or for me it is necessary to be met with the adherents only under cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">Will I forced become leyboristkoy and to hide my present persuasions?</seg>
<seg id="64">Forthcoming i three years began to seem by hell, complete of persecutions and solitude.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Only instructor in my college, who did not hide his conservative convictions, were Norman Stone, professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">It they hated not only for the belonging with the conservatives, but also for the fact that it was the adviser of Thatcher on questions of foreign policy and one of its spichrayterov.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the college it practically did not appear.</seg>
<seg id="68">It despised it for the provinciality, meanness and adherence to Marxist-deterministic view on the history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 it accepted professorial post at the university of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">“Here you will not be happy”, he said to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to drive into Oxford from parental house to London, trying to find refuge among the relatives and unprejudiced capital friends.</seg>
<seg id="72">I said to father that I hate Oxford it explained reason.</seg>
<seg id="73">It did not believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">Any political views there started during its studies in the fortieth years.</seg>
<seg id="75">“But indeed the same the best university in the world, he said sorrowfully.</seg>
<seg id="76"> - It is not there to similar capable, only not in the city of the dremlyushchikh spires…</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my friend-Communists always behaved flawlessly”.</seg>
<seg id="78">Its moist eyes turned turbid.</seg>
<seg id="79">“Do not assume the hasty solutions.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am confident, that this is simple of joke.</seg>
<seg id="81">You will break to me heart, if you throw university”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was iznurena constants to the trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also conservative, did not maintain pressure and he forewent its persuasions.</seg>
<seg id="84">On the following week during the seminar, when the sequential instructor of history completely seriously named me “the enemy of people”, I decided to enter so.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the soul burning from the shame, I acknowledged that “to me washed the brains the parents”, and were named they “old fools”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Respite was brief.</seg>
<seg id="87">Last nail into the cover of the coffin of my career in Oxford it was judged drive in to my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time he wrote each week on two columns for the publications, which belong to Rupert Murdock.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was closed.</seg>
<seg id="90">I did not leave, and my persecutors were returned after five minutes.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, whereas I gathered trunk and villages to the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I so did not return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">Can call me cry-baby and rag.</seg>
<seg id="94">But into eighteen years no one must become the object of this malice and intimidations in the educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="95">Those sadder, that this was Oxford, which not only let out fourteen Prime Ministers of Tory, but also to this day it is hidden behind the undeserved reputation of the university, at which they value equality and freethinking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heaviest profession in the world: miners the kava-Idzhena</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four Euros Indonesian miners risk by life and by health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of volcano along the steep stony paths</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people, for which their work - hell, and others literally work in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them anta Vidzhayya, one of 400 miners, who earn to the life of the outputs of sulfur in the volcano kava-Idzhen, located to the east of Indonesian island Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Each day of antae gets down on the very bottom of the crater, where the sulfur dioxide, which is risen from the depths of the Earth, thickens with the contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After separating the enormous pieces of sulfur, whose total weight can reach 70 kg, it places them into two bamboo baskets, loads baskets on the arms and bears them upward along the precipitous stony road.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the top of the volcano, whose height composes 2,386 meters, altogetheronly of 250 meters; however, to the emaciated loaders are required more than 40 minutes, in order to rise by tortoise step, with difficulty retaining equilibrium and carefully groping road in order not to stumble and not to fall from the break.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one incorrect step can cost them life, as this happened of one tourist of France, which was torn away several years ago from the cliffs kava-Idzhena.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners kava-Idzhena earn 5 evrotsentov for each kilogram of sulfur, which they obtain</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">After proving to be above, they lay to themselves the road between the tourists, who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and, it got tired bearing heavy baskets, step three kilometers to the weights, which the mining company arranged scarcely higher, at the height of 1,850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">The discussion deals with PT of Kandy Ngrimbi, enterprise, which exploits since 1960 this volcano and, it is better and not to say, its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 evrotsentov) for each kilogram of sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 evrotsentov) to petrochemical productions, indeed this mineral is extended in the daily life and is used for preparing of matches, fireworks, cosmetic, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">“Since standard is the carrying-over of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 Euros) for each to the mine passage”, explains to us anta, which usually carries out three daily carrying-overs.</seg>
<seg id="14">It spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels itself broken; however, they make possible for it to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 Euros) toward the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this seems by mizerom for this superhuman effort, this is triply more than that it would earn in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Daily pay of miners is very high on the local measures, where for the collection by coffee they pay 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euros) during the day and average monthly earnings it is equal to two million rupees (167 Euros)”, explains the loader, who earlier worked as mason in the tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There its wage composed 75,000 rupees (6.2 Euros) during the day and section was not such heavy, but antae returned with its family into Banyuvangi, town not far from the volcano, for the important reason, which in Indonesia is the same crushing as sulfur: “I was married the girl with Bali, where some induisty, and brought it in Java so that it would accept Islam”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In anta asthma, it breathes with difficulty, constantly it coughs, and in it eyes because of the toxic gases water</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In its 27 years of antae were conducted three years, risking by itself in the kava-Idzhene, whose sulfur already began to affect it in spite of the presence of mask and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">In it asthma, it breathes with difficulty, constantly it coughs, and in it eyes because of the toxic gases, which separate volcano, water.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price, which it must pay for reaching of its dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">“I will work already two years, because I want to open store or to study Spanish or French”, it promises in more than acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished by life, this pleasant and clever young person could be tourist guide, waiter or hall porter in the hotel, but instead of this he carries out the work of mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">After dividing dirty wooden cabin with other porters, it arises each day at two P.M., because sulfur will not cease to emerge at night, when its characteristic yellow is converted in the blue and it blestit among the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="25">Throwing call shadows, it gets down by antae into the crater, illuminating to itself road by the small lamp, connected to its helmet, which it itself purchased to its money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The baskets with the gray on their arms from the bottom of the volcano drag about 400 porters</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In spite of the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the output of sulfur for the savings of expenditures and it gives no equipment the porters, who work on their calculation and with such deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually, they do not obtain even part from 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euros) of the collection for photography, which, together with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euros), the guards of this preserve collect from the tourists, who come in order to photograph volcano and its person-mules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">“This work for the cattle, but not for the people”, declares Badrusin, the thickset porter of 42 years, who conducted on the kava-Idzhene three decades, since left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">The capable of raising to 110 kilograms, it assures, which will suffer work “as much, as will be able”, because money for the education of their three children at the age from 18 to 10 years necessary to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not retire on pension, I will die here, because volcano - this entire my life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although sulfur anneals throat and burns the eyes, when wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense columns of smoke, which emerge from the volcano, they are so hardy that none complains about its severe illnesses… their more serious, obviously, than customary problems with the respiration, arthroses, pain in the elbows and ulcer on the arms, which were deformed under the gravity of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balancing basket on the spin, Unaynik now only can raise 50 kilograms in its 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Each day it and its comrades will carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the storage in Tamansari, covering distance into 18 kilometers along the narrow path among the brushwood.</seg>
<seg id="35">“I will not retire on pension, I will die here, because volcano - this entire my life”, declares Unaynik, widely opening mouth, in which several teeth are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="36">From its five children, the elder, 30 years, also works as the carrier of sulfur.</seg>
<seg id="37">Time is passed, but misery immortalizes from generation to generation one of the heaviest occupations in the world: that how are occupied human mules kava-Idzhena.</seg>

<seg id="12">We knew that the government attempted to make much, for example to carry out starting of perfumes with pheromones or to organize the parties of rapid acquaintances (blits-meetings).</seg>
<seg id="13">Many of these ideas were, possibly, creative, but not necessarily they operated.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore we did think, why to us not to make the most creative thing from the possible in order to solve this problem, to namely compose rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1,2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who does not receive this so lightly, so this government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It spends 1,300 US dollars per year on the policy for the enthusiasm of citizens for the generation of a larger quantity of children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">State packet for the conjugal pairs and parents allows to 15,000 dollars to the child, prolongs vacations on pregnancy and childbirths and ensures tax breaks.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all this has low effectiveness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore - this rich and highly technological state-city in southeastern Asia, also noted for the conservatism of its management and by its strict public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The level of birth rate in Singapore, according to its national control according to population, is located at present on the level of 1,2 children to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was below 2nd that known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why singapurtsy do not have a larger quantity of children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan twist min, the director of the department of policy on the conjugal pairs and families for national control according to population, he indicates that reason to that “improved formation” and “the wider range of career opportunities”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">“This allowed people to have available the wider range of versions in the fact that vital purposes and priorities, besides wedding and creation of family”, it explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in the social standards contribute to increase in the quantity of bachelors and to postponement of marriages and generation of children, as a result of which it was lowered the level of birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile the immigration policy, which is directed toward a sharp increase in the immigration for the opposition to the reduction of population, causes resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are the Web sites, where flourishes hardly hidden xenophobia in the attitude of many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese, whom they criticize for the maintenance of wages at the low level and unwillingness to be integrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">An increase in the immigration is also considered as by one of reason for the fact that in the past year ruling party of Singapore obtained the worse result on the selections from the times of independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After selections there was the attempt to solve problem, with the aid of the quotas and more heavy taxes for the foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While a drop in the birth rate renders known influence on economic growth in the nation, tax revenues, expenditures for medicine and policy of immigration, an example of Singapore also begins to have some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Government makes efforts so that it would not be built the so many small dwelling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, this beginning to influence in the sector of real estate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Management on the urban development passed to the control of the number of small apartments, known as “shoe box”, which can be built in the specific city districts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments are very well sold by the area of 46 square meters.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, there is the opinion that they can contribute to an unmarried way of life and deprive of the stimulus of the housebuilders, who want to build large family dwelling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But LIM of Yu of Sun, the Director-General of house-building firm EL Developers, says that them “shoe boxes” they are sold considerably more rapidly than more spacious copies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in that sense that such apartments buy up by several days, even weeks, it is more rapid than the apartment of larger size.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our received payments increase as a result of this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Nevertheless, it recognizes that the new standards give more clear orientators for the housebuilders, to which earlier were placed the obstacles, if they wanted to propose too many small apartments in the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too overstressed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore - this is city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules can be step in the direction of an increase in the national birth rate, after conversation with singapurtsami, which work in the financial block of center, it seems that they will not have special effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">“People are very overstressed, dwelling expensive, just as formation, and because of this many people this put aside”, says young controller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">“But for me it is important to have available its own money and time”, says another young person of 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention their career, stress and prices of the dwelling and formation as the reasons, which prevent them from starting children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">So that, however government tried to impel its citizens to the generation of children, in the fact that child-bearing, last word remains after singapurtsami.</seg>

<seg id="8">In four cases they associated term with “something very my”, in the personal plane, and “by password and by user name”, when was applied it to the social networks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">“My very big secrets I did not load into the post”, says ten-year Jorge, when attempts to explain the value of personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail Windows of Live Messenger, where in it already two years are accounts.</seg>
<seg id="10">“These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the entire world”, it asserts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures from the games.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also I am entertained with my acquaintances.</seg>
<seg id="13">“I did not share with the photograph, which not my, or someone, who behaves foolishly”, he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">Boy realizes, which is bad to publish the indecent photographs of the exposed people, crimes or to write insulting or furious commentaries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge assures, which knows 35 friends, whom in its FB, and nine its folloverov into Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Majorities of them relatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mother in the course, in it is a password to one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">I brought Twitter in order to express itself and to write interesting tweets.</seg>

<seg id="27">“If to me they will begin to press or to require, simply I will remove them from my account”, it recognizes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Jose became the follower of Ask after the reading of recommendation into Twitter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">To boy is not alien the experience of the fact that is today known as kibermobbing.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">In contrast to Jorge, this boy would load the photographs of acquaintances in the inconvenient or awkward situations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yes, I would make this, if man does not please me or if me this he wants.</seg>
<seg id="38">“Although I know that this kibermobbing”, he confirms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The key issues</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marelos Porras, the instructor of English and specialist for the formation and instruction, considers that in order to ship children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand, that the purpose of social networks - to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">“The Internet appeared as means for retrieval for information, but with the advent of these sites changed rules of the game”, it notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras indicates that the academician Mark Prenskya, the master of pedagogy from the Yale university and the author of labor digital aborigines and immigrants, invented these terms for explaining this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">Digital aborigines these are they, the children and young people, who were born in the epoch of technologies.</seg>
<seg id="44">“We digital immigrants, which it is necessary to teach them, while we still themselves learn”, she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It explains, that this theme is complex, “because we them we request to have the specific criterion of the fact that is possible or cannot be extended, published or spoken, at the age, when maturity is not sufficient for this”.</seg>
<seg id="46">“Also that they would be selective, while most important of all for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences”, it adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the specialist, the most effective method to show what is privacy is to children and to adolescents, to present the question, which force them to reflect.</seg>
<seg id="48">“To tell in them so that they would not make this, is useless”, it adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then Porras transfers some versions: there are the things, which you would not describe to stranger, so why you this do make in the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, to you it would be pleased, if they would publish photograph you like that did publish you about your friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do know you that others they do publish about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">When you do sign photographs from the parties, do request you permission in other people, in order to note them?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more, by all whether it is necessary to know that you do make at each moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">One additional point - this to give to them to understand that they must behave online, just as makes this off-line.</seg>
<seg id="55">Rules are the same.</seg>
<seg id="56">“Out of the Internet man behaves with the respect, responsibility and other principles, so must be in the social networks”, it asserts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Vigilance</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, university instructor, professor of elementary education and consultant for the formation, explains the need for that so that the heads of families honestly would read the policy of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="59">Understanding each of the points, they have good bases for the conversations with the children about the prerequisites of the discovery of Internet account.</seg>
<seg id="60">“For example, age and that which is permitted to extend or to publish”, he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Accordingly Gaurdiya, key issue - to remind children of lesson “do not speak to strangers”.</seg>

<seg id="1">“South America must learn in Europe in a question of the integration of citizenship”: Raphael Korre</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The President of Ecuador, Raphael Korre, confirmed today that the creation of general citizenship is the purpose, in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn in Europe”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Korrea, which participated in VI the presidential summit of the union of South American nations (UNASUR), conducted in Lima, it stated to the government television of Peru that the Europeans " killed each other during the Second World War”, also, in other collisions, “however, now they practically one fatherland”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It protected the project of the establishment of South American citizenship, which approve the country-participants UNASUR, in this context.</seg>
<seg id="5">“It is necessary to attain the free displacement of citizens and workers over any South American country, as this already occurs with the terms of Andskogo association, but, until now there are the reaction sectors, which want to return us to the past”, it warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Ecuadorian President appeared himself, furthermore, by the supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAG) under the prerequisite of reduction in the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into the attention of those, who signed the pact of san jose about human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those, who read lecture, never take to themselves any obligations, but we, yuzhnoamerikantsy we, on the contrary, sign everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">“It is not explained, that the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is financed by the United States”, he stated, hinting at the political refuge, given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Korrea certified, that it does not feel sorry about this solution, because with it did not betray its principles, but were observed its “deep values of democracy and human rights”.</seg>
<seg id="10">It added that in their time “there were the specific suspicions of the fact that Assange will be extradited into third country and will not be observed process”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It criticized severely, furthermore, Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive to its territory for the examination concerning the assumed crime on the sexual soil, while “Swedish legislation itself considers possible to carry out it by means of the video conference, which it would be possible to make from the embassy of Ecuador in London”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Korrea confirmed that there is a risk of worsening in physical and mental health of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">“I did not speak with it from those times, as he arrived in our embassy, but ambassador to me it reported that it has the small pulmonary problem, nothing serious”, said Ecuadorian the Head of State.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That actually be, so this the danger of worsening in its physical and mental health because of the imprisonment in the small space without the opportunity to make exercises in air.</seg>
<seg id="15">“This influences the health of any person”, it added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Korrea indicated that the solution of the problem of the refuge, given to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of the assignment to the guarantee of inviolability, which will allow it to go into Ecuador, is located in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs and he emphasized that there were the talks in London about the search for the solution of the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not conduct the negotiations about human rights, this word we in this case is not utilized, but there were constant discussions.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The solution of this problem is located in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs, because the attorney Assange, Baltasar Garson, conducts a number of processes in different European instances”, he mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And expressed the opinion that “if Great Britain tomorrow grants the guarantee of inviolability, this will end”.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden, as for it wonderfully is allowed its legislation and as it already made in other cases, will interrogate Senor Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or will interrogate him on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Korrea used the case in order to appear itself as the defender of press freedom he emphasized that does not suffer “the mediocrities, unconscientiousness and lie, which distort freedom of expression”.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Main enemies of press freedom this not damaged villain-politicians, but poor journalists, who support profit, blackmail and extortion”, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this aspect it remained contented, that already neither these journalists, “nor bankers nor bourgeois country-predominant powers rule in Ecuador”, and it added that, being re-elected, “will be deepened the revolution for continuing the development in the right direction”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Korrea also supported the solution to preserve the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least to the following selections, arguing this fact that the organization “must be solid and not suffer opportunism and support of revolutions under the mask of legality”, because in actuality “this destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Ecuadorian President considered, furthermore, “completely substantiated” the desire of his Columbian of colleague Juan Manuel Santos to conduct now the negotiations with Nicaragua about the sea boundaries between two countries after the resolution of the International Court of Justice of justice of the Hague, which proved to be in favor Nicaraguan sea sovereignty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This solution is not observed at the given moment.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is the problem between the South American and Central American countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is necessary to process them together in order to overcome them and to continue to advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also it expressed hope for a good completion of the dispute about the sea boundaries, which Veduta in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed, which “is correct for Latin America to turn into the international instances, if two countries obyazuyutsya to make the decision, such as heavy it not was”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Concerning the opportunity to come out as the candidate on the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador in order to be a candidate for the third period contract, it indicated that is examined this opportunity “with large optimism and happiness, although sometimes this is sufficiently heavy”.</seg>
<seg id="32">Korrea certified, which if loses on the selections in February 2013, then it will leave from public life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">In the personal plan I never was interested in the authority, but in such wrong situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be corrected only from the side of political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">“My political movement considered, that precisely I guaranteed this likely victory, so that is necessary to recognize this responsibility”, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In the case of victory this would become my last period in the place of president, and then we leave from public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">If we lose, the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">“This solution”, confirmed it.</seg>
<seg id="38">Korrea also mentioned the new course of the treatment of the Venezuelan President of Hugo Chavez in Cuba.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Mortality from AIDS today - the result of late diagnostics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 year, when they declared to it, that its analysis to AIDS yielded positive results.</seg>
<seg id="3">“Me as if they stunned”, it recalls that difficult, in spite of entire time of doctor, moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">Youth hid this from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">After deciding to manage the disease independently, it wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And its efforts justified - it already noted its 43-y birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabrizio - one of “oldest” patients of the HIV-department of the hospital of Hospital Civil de of Guadalajara (HCG), where it fell in 1994, after overcoming numerous obstacles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It lives with the diagnosis “the virus of the immunodeficiency of man” (HIV) already 22 years. At the beginning of the 90's into this it would be complicated to believe - too little then there existed the versions of treatment, they knew too a few about the disease, too preconceived they related to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, even director of the clinic of the Mexican institute of social protection did not want to be requested with it, “because he has cut”.</seg>
<seg id="9">In those times to in other words, have AIDS was sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and to make this, without worsening quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, without knowing about their illness, until now, many people come, when virus already caused loss, it " wasted” their immune system and they suffer from the opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 year after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least after the first declared cases, “great achievement at the given moment is the fact that the survival of the patient, who begins treatment in proper time, and survival of general population exactly are identical”, indicated the head of HIV-department HCG, to Khayme Andrade Vilyanueva, after referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Infektsionist expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Vilyanueva explained, that since 2008 the scientists came to the conclusion that AIDS is not sentence; however, duration and quality of life they depend on the degree of the defeat of the immune system, available in patients with the beginning of diagnostics, from best expected by lifetime in those, who it does not use the narcotics: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and of up to 50 years, when it communicates about 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply stated, above-mentioned means that the one who obtains the diagnosis positive 25 years of HIV-positive at the age, according to these terms, “supporting control, will be able to live without the problems up to 75 years”, it explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to estimate this progress, one should recall that the lifetime of Mexicans on the average is today 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality was considerably reduced in recent years, in the case of Mexico, of numbers of people, which die from AIDS, was reduced from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual report YUNEYDS), also is also true that they died from the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and are already registered 187 deaths by May of this year; nevertheless, it is asserted that there is general access to the anti-retrovirus preparations since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why, until now, there are lethal outcomes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> - It personally me seems that problem not in the access to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I this visualize, so are matters in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the minimum the last 12 years we did not have deficiency in the drugs, problem in the fact that the patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected state, i.e., at the last stages of disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It cited crushing data: “Nine of ten patients come, when they already have any opportunistic infection; what must be done in order to have a larger effect on general mortality, so this to carry out diagnostics at the earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to allow tests for the detection on a mass scale, for all people, which this will request”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In their proposal are agreed in the opinion the specialists and officials of the Council of State for the preventive maintenance of AIDS to Jalisco (COESIDA), and also patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned for the checking into the particular laboratory, prompted only by the fact that this made its friend and, in spite of his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even he suffered Kaposi's sarcoma, cancerous tumor, which is one of the extended complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes, when you know that in you AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and nothing they want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">“Once nevertheless I will die, better I will nadiratsya three times a week”, they say. But not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I feed well, I make exercises, I assume medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, its parents only know that it endured cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live normal life as any another.</seg>
<seg id="30">“I work, i have it is many occupations, I travel, I conduct active sexual life, but with the mutual responsibility, I worry about itself and about other person”, transferred Fabrizio, who agreed to share with his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to spodvignut by its statement of those, who now, in the context of the world day of fight with AIDS, experience fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let it be they verified, if there was the risk of infection, albeit as soon as possible they learn, they are they HIV-positive, then better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let it be they learn, that they can live as any other person, being by critical.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its this communication sums up the theme of fight against AIDS in this 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms after the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The precipices between the programs in the region of public health and simple citizen are great, assumes Ricardo Salazar, the journalist from Guadalajara, who studied the problem, connected HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And largest this is preventive maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the places, dedicated to this task, “in reality increased the propagation of condoms, earlier to us gave one or two, now to us give packets on hundred, and this very well, but it occurs that there are those, who, until now do not now have a access to the condom”, he, said.</seg>
<seg id="37">The adolescents are located among most vulnerable to the new infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">“Why they to you?” this is the popular question, with the malice and censure, from the side of social workers, school consultants, the colleagues of drugstores and workers of public health, which do not want to hear the adolescents, propagandist certified.</seg>
<seg id="39">I propose to change this ineffective distribution; so that the condoms would be not only after the counters and so that hundreds of them it would be located in the automatic weapons in the public toilets in the places, which it frequently attends young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not the encouragement of disorderliness.</seg>
<seg id="41">The discussion does not deal with the payment of beer and motelya, governor Emilio Gonzalez answered, when they asked it, the distribution of condoms with its management was possible.</seg>
<seg id="42">“This is not sexuality, it is best to make condoms accessible for those, who already practice sexual activity”, he noted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Taking into account ratification by the court of appeals of the United States of the solution, which annuls the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitros, achieved by means of the competitive production in Mexico, scenario establishes fateful precedent for any national company with the branches in the neighboring country, which has problems with the solvency.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It seems that the procedures in the support of the survival of the firms, which are permitted by Mexican laws, are not real in the country of strips and stars, in the contradiction with the international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the practical sphere, the approval of the solution, carried out on June 15 by the judge of Kharlin Hale in the court of bankruptcies of the northern region of Texas, leaves defenseless the Mexican firms before face of the opportunity of the imposition of arrest on their property on that side of Rio Grande.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, decision opens doors to the chief producer of glass in Mexico for the rotation into the Supreme Court of the United States, leading into the proof three nonconformities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">As the entry, while the judge of the matter notes that the creditors must be regulated by the code of the USA about bankruptcy, the court of appeals of the fifth region, located in New Orleans, he indicates that the basic trial concerns the competitive production, examined in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point implies the annulment of international judicial collaboration in the cases of the insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Actually, the standard law of the United Nations for the unification of the right of international trade for this purpose was created, determining as the arbiter the American institute of right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Verdict it in the second place, establishes that without the interfirm voting, acknowledged in the critical mass of the competitive production of debts, which had before the maternal company branches of Vitros, it would not be achieved the majority, necessary for asserting the restructuring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, this opportunity recognize Mexican laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fakticheskya, Vitro was not the first case, when this diagram starts.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are half dozens of the examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, the federal institute of competitive productions guaranteed whose interfirm debts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Is also true that reading the voices of branches, one way or another the creditors of Vitros, who fought with it in the vessels of the United States, namely funds “carrion vultures” like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Voting would be 45 percent against 37.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">These given court of appeals descends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From the other side, it charges Vitros with the complex situation, which that encountered since 2008, touched upon by the serious economic crisis, which overtake the United States, delivering impacts in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thus far the firm of family Gonzalez garden will produce the appeal of the solution into court of appeals himself so that the voting would reach before his plenum, i.e., five judges, in view of the fact that they voted only three.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In the case of failure the petition about the certification, which will require the revision of process from the side of the court of the higher authority, in this case of the Supreme Court of the United States, will be produced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Is worse anything the fact that the court deflected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (“the friend of court”), in which was described the process, which follows Vitro within the framework of the law about the competitive productions, signaling about the fact that it frees itself from the observance of the agreements, signed by both countries in order to connect it with the article 15 laws of the USA about bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, it is noted that the country obeyed the principles of the commission of the United Nations on international trade, i.e., to the rules, established for the cases of the intergovermental insolvency, which guarantee equality of rights for the debtors and creditors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hector “Khetin” of Reyes: “Basketball was my life”</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Inveterate basketball traveller Hector “Khetin” of Reyes was more than 60 years connected with this sport and, because of it, the entire world travelled over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Almost no one in Puerto Rico stores in the memory so many basketball histories as Hector “Khetin” of Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And indeed, before hemorrhage into the brain it riveted it to the invalid carriage in 2008, Reyes was submerged in the sport during more than 60 years, as the player of small categories, the player of the highest basketball league, authorized and the leader of BSN with the cowboys of Bayamona and President of the federation of basketball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“I carried out many roles in the basketball during my life, including somewhat simultaneously, sporadically I was the President BSN, Director-General of national team and President of federation in the 90's”, recalls Reyes during the visit of Primera Hora to it home into Bayamon, where it lives from Isabel, by its accurate by wife for the elongation it is more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Basketball was my life”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes it does not exaggerate, making this assertion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of its houses, almost everyone decorated with photographs and memorable things, assembled for its long journey, testifies about this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamon in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">With the naibolshimi emotions it stores those, which remember its way through the cowboys, beginning from the middle of the 50th years as the player until 1982, when 15 years of his appearance in the role of with-agent or agent of contract were carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">“These were my best years, by which I delighted in most of all, because had an opportunity to be the part of eight championships of cowboys since 1967, as the agent, with-agent or leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many years of happiness of the, including five championships, which passed with 1971 until 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then I was requested with one in 1981, per year debuts of Jerome Minsi in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From that moment henceforth to lead it began “Kuko” of Ortis, which was great administrator”, was indicated Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that Gina the Bart, which was sent here and it was at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), it said to me: “I for you have a very strong player, with increase in 6 ' 7”.</seg>
<seg id="16">“You want?”</seg>
<seg id="17">And this was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Bart then it recommended the sniper of Raymonda of Gauss, who obtained citizenship and became one of our best bombardiers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember that he said that if Minsi brought the championship to Bayamonu, Gauss would help to conquer one more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">By the championship of cowboys with Gauss I took pleasure, but already at a distance, because he was by 1988 already registered by the chief of federation.</seg>
<seg id="21">By that time I preferred to delight in by his achievements and achievements of Minsi in the national composite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember, as we won the first time in the USA during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the world championship of 1990, on which we obtained the fourth place and this it had to be bronze, if not that Canadian judge, who forced us to re-play final game, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">That command from the world championship of 1990 - this the best composite, such as you did sometimes see?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It among the good, just as that won in Dream Team on the Olympic Games of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my dear was that from the Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the team of the USA, which was sufficiently similar to that, which won bronze on the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">In that command not only again played Minsi, Gaussa, Ramon Rivasa, Fico of Lopez and “Pikulina” (Ortisa), but also young (Javier) “Tonito” column and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quixote” of Morales, which could not participate in 90 because of the injury of elbow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The command, which was, possibly, not best in the plan of personnel, but brought to us gold medal and great happiness, was the command of the Olympic qualification tournament of 1995 in Neukene, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the role players like “Kanito” of Nevesa, Pablo Alise and young Rolando Khurruitnera of instead of players, temporarily removed for the disorder in the Pan-American championship of Mar-del-Plata, we won gold in spite of all forecasts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without any doubts, this was Pikulin Ortis.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its indices at the international tournaments impress.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico prevailed at this level in the manner that this made Pikulin.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without taking into account its career in different leagues, in which it played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best Puerto Rican by leader?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a very complex question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have the very good young animals, that includes of Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raymonda to Dalmau, Armandito Torresa.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the young, me greatly pleases the work of Leo Arilly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What you do count as your main reaching in the federation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Participation in most glorious epoch of the national composite between 1988 and 1995, and which at the beginning of the 90's in BSN was to 17 commands in the season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What to you did remain to make?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There were the things, which I wanted to realize, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example so that the boys from Ponse would play only in their region and only against the commands from other parts of the island in the national play off.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now children travel and they play too much, and this is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I see fruits of required certification and course for the controlling, officials and judges.</seg>
<seg id="46">This reaches pleasure to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What you do now make?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Most of all I listen to music, look musical video of my epoch at YouTube, I delight in by my grandsons and rarely I walk to the basketball matches.</seg>
<seg id="49">And I, of course, delight in by the society of my husbands, Icabel, which was always with me.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The course, which investigates “the end of the world”, begins</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Each week students investigate the apocalyptical phenomena, such as nuclear war, by zombie, viruses and bacterium and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In this semester, when the professor of religion Stewart charm decided to read course about the end of the world, he knew that he had available the irresistable bait: the end “long reverse counting” of the calendar of the Mayas, on December 21, for which were grasped many people as for the proof of the fact that the end of the world approaches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But charm of concept it did not have, which it expected into the near the pair of the months: the catastrophic hurricane of Sendi, the financial crisis, which some call “dolgoarmageddonom”, and the growing conflict, where they will pull Israel, place, where the Christian theorists of the end of the times assume that the apocalypse will begin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">“I did not realize, that this there will be the most apocalyptical semester of all”, it said charm on this week to the university students of Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If we analyze that which occurs in the world at present, as if remained only 30 days, this was actually good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And you remember that poor is good for those, in whom apocalyptical viewpoint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is the only professor, who proposes courses on the theme “of the end of the world” in this semester, theoretically last in the history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the Templskiy university the associate professor Barry Vaker reads the course “of the mass media, culture and the end of the world”.</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week students investigate the apocalyptical themes, such as nuclear war, by zombie, viruses and bacterium, and global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">“We analyze, why these ideas in the course of time are extended”, he said, and the method, to which the hypothetical scenarios, which cause specific behavior of man, propose.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it can break out war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In this month the students analyzed films on the apocalyptical themes and they studied, as they are correlated with examples from the real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">“I attempted to describe to students about that which is possible, probably, it is plausible and it is impossible”, said Vaker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In the main campus of the university of the state of Pennsylvania the professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara to Solari, the associate professor of the history of art and anthropology, were combined in order to read the course, which is called simply “the end of the world”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">“We do not add “2012” in order to always have the capability to read course again, if the end of the world will not begin”, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In spite of “unavoidable destruction”, the students must learn, prepare projects and pass total examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In Penn State total examination will start on the eve of apocalypse that it does not leave to the students of another selection, except as to work “to that night itself, into which supposedly will begin the end of the world”, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Courses proved to be sufficiently popular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">“Places ended in two hours”, spoke Restall about its course for the students with the high average mark, to which were written down 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">We obtained communications on the electronic mail during many weeks before beginning semester from the people, which asked, there are whether other places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Students, in turn, certify, that this course is one of the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">“Me it pleases to observe, that make people, in order to comfort themselves”, said Bridzhid Robinson, 23-year student of the department of religion and sociology from Khaddonfilda, New Jersey, into Rutgers-Kamden.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the apocalyptical viewpoint, secular or religious, this is a only question of comfort or its absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Will Vekes, the 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and sister's matter, said that he looked all apocalyptical films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">“I never heard about the course, which would teach this”, it noted.</seg>
<seg id="27">It pleases me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the interrogated students - speaking already about the professor - did not say that it believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">“Our first project affected the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain kind we it discredited”, said Dzhuli Zeglen, the 21--year student of last course at the Templskiy university from West-Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; this is simply key moment in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">But it noted that there is a apocalyptical concern in the Western culture, which counts several centuries, where the people react to the changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet caused an increase in these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">“In other places people do not think about this”, he said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Predominantly in English-speaking peace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">By Joseph Dogerti, the professor of the religion of university Lasalle, who teaches courses on the Philippines in this year, rapidly answered a question about that, he does know about any course about “the end of the world” there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">“The Philippines do not assume participation at the end of the light”, it wrote, hinting at the order of the higher authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have pardon from the Pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall focused attention, which for the duration of long time told about many days of last court, and he said that if nothing it occurs on December 21, “people immediately they will begin to think about the following date” or to philosophize, that on December 21 it is the beginning of the seven-year period, after a lapse of which peace will end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and instructors carelessly relate to this date.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some said that they are going to go to the parties “of the end of the world”.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">“It can be, I will ring someone of the friends in order to together laugh”, commented on Samir Ford, the 20-year student of the department of connection.</seg>
