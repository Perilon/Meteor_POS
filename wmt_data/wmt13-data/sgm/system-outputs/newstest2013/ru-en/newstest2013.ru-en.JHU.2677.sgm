<h1>
<seg id="1">Republican resistance to Obama's election strategy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justified their policies need to struggle against spin in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in the center of the бреннана believe the myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, the lawyers Republicans accounted for only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing we can say with confidence: these new trends will have a negative effect on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike the Canadian American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is why most state governments since 2009 pass laws, усложняющие registration process or voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 States.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result only for one year 2011 was made 180 bills, restrict the right to vote in 41 state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">New election laws require voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship and identity card with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws are cutting the early voting period, упраздняют право voter registration in day expression and take away the right to vote with the citizens, who has a previous conviction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections no American state does not oblige voters to present identification card with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana became the first state, who introduced such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law, adopted in 2008 in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities hastened to spread this practice and to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the last two years they have bills, binding voters to present identity card with a photograph, in 34 States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that in contrast to Quebec American citizens do not have a universal ID cards, such as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, then there are 21 million people, reaching the required for voting age have no identity card with a photograph, which was issued by the government body of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds a hundred dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people, зарабатывающих less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of people aged 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with a photograph.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But that is not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students - voters, which is supposed to vote for candidates from the democrats in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph, issued by their educational estab-lishment.</seg>
<seg id="26">But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote for the Republicans, mainly used for voting certificates issued by these clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Until 2004, no state has demanded proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="29">Starting in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures, obviously, are meant to limit voting immigrants from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican lawmakers have laws in 2011, упраздняющие voter registration on election day in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="33">They also have the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">This restriction has not passed without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to make the lists of about 10 million people.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, has led to a fall in 17% of registering new voters in 2010 as compared with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other States, laws, aimed at reducing the period of early voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters, voters ahead of schedule, were афроамериканцами, although recent accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters statewide.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same thing happened to come from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="40">Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule.</seg>
<seg id="41">Unlike the white, which, forming 76% of voters, among them достроково accounted for only 46%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, законодатели-демократы and their supporters are actively opposed to adopt laws that restrict registered voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several draft laws was ветировано губернаторами-демократами.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most ambiguous laws was suspended for intervention by the Prosecutor General of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="45">This has partly to limit the negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="46">So, for example, only 16 of 34 States adopted laws requiring ртедясчмеойс identity card with a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules, joined the action, of course, затруднят implementation of the voting rights at the 2012 election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that have been adopted, seeing in them a clear focus on it, to influence the 2012 election results in key states.</seg>
<seg id="49">The report center бреннана from 2011 demonstrates that States that implemented these laws are 171 of 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="51">Only one thing clearly: these new provisions will have a negative effect on turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostate cancer screening, pass the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In fact, the PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные, which lead to бесполезному medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">Men, and so reluctant to underlying диспансеризацию is, from which begin to doubt even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pass the test or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We asked the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The research, conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the groups, so the data is difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time the European, found differing levels of mortality in those patients who were screened, and those who do not it took place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The study also found that, after the 12-year-old observation, the likelihood of a metastasis in 30-40% higher than those who do not have passed screening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I would recommend to take from the test with 40 or 50 years, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Men of African American origin also are at higher risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The key point is that the right decision, as soon as the cancer is detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cancer can be both aggressive and вялотекущим.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient needs to clarify the degree of risk his ракового disease, offering him options, without necessarily prostate cancer treatment, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many men who have detected cancer, will not take place, as their cancer treatment not aggressive and poses no threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will offer them an active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will start treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Increasingly we with precision define criteria for making a decision about who should or should not pass a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, I would recommend is to pass the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is important to consult with your doctor to determine or not, you have to pass the test.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">To prevent disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no чудо-рецепта, to prevent cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that if all the people well fed and enough move, 30% of raco could be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If no one smoked, this figure rose to at least 50%," said André болье, a spokesman for the Canadian association of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer caused by наследственностью.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several types of cancer are completely unaccountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it is a risk factor for many of the other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is doing enormous damage to health.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says spokesman andre болье.</seg>
<seg id="33">Promising fact: ten years after abandoning the smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophageal, pancreatic and ovarian cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," add the association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The association also recommends that restrict their consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It should also avoid meat products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The last may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," "explained in the Association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, many scientists engaged in research on the impact of vitamin supplements to the development of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But at the moment the results of these studies cannot be called clear.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the scc, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">If one of them showed the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.</seg>
<seg id="49">In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D and there is no complete clarity.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Boson Higgs in detail</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last summer, a message that scientists might find boson Higgs, caused a real boom - and not without reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nor much or little.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, this is the last particle whose existence has been predicted in the standard model - our best, or, in any case," the least imperfect "descriptions of nature and behavior of matter," but that had not been found experimentally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But physics are not fully confident that he was talking about бозоне Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without any doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that she strongly resembles boson predicted the standard model Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, the new data presented this week at the one major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed, although for the complete confidence of some data still lacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Imagine all the same, that it is about бозоне Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem minimal, and see what it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is, in this world one law is inevitable, гласящий, two things that cannot be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">To get around this rule there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But although the particle physics is quite a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: the Pauli exclusion, which suggests that the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "квантовом state" is a "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Based on this, the share of particle physics in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner, we find decent citizens, called фермионами, who wisely obey the principle of spin-statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the other same scurrying around бозоны гнусная gang anarchists, who have no respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can преспокойно prove to be in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to website (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, these бозоны are, in turn, into two groups: meson, of which we speak here will not, and "force" through which particles are the main forces of nature and to which in some ways is boson Higgs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all such exotic creatures, as you might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly банальному бозону: фотону, or "частице light," which is a "courier" electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, when one particle, which has an electric charge is accelerating or changes direction, it "violates" electromagnetic field in that particular place, like a stone, rubbed in the pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">From this "violations" making-an-agent-of electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing but, as фотоном - and, therefore, one of бозонов "a host of power."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same thing is happening with бозоном Higgs, with the only difference that to this boson appeared, must be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to initiate it, need to achieve very high energies, as if it was about замерзшем pond surface which could be shaken by a very large stone.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, as one who operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful and also to explain the relationship between бозоном Higgs and mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, interact, others - no: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact, have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">So, what can bring all of these studies," Ms. plamondon asks? "</seg>
<seg id="29">In science, they are used to validate the standard model (cm), and it also allows physicists find divergence between the results of observations and predictions cm.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides, some of them passionately wanted to this divergence was found, T. K. the slightest discrepancy may open the door to new physics "and" plug some holes model.</seg>
<seg id="31">The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (ой-ой!).</seg>
<seg id="32">But while at CERN such conflict is not found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Benefit from this research for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.</seg>
<seg id="35">See: in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research at bell labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.</seg>
<seg id="36">They foresee their application in science, but not more than that.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at bell labs, where in 1960 was invented laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962., said that initially the laser was seen rather as "lab gadget."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">And in addition, the application may have to інструментарію accompanying the study.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, the same уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.</seg>
<seg id="41">This sensor, though this was not at all its original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">It is, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that it may be.</seg>

<seg id="4">However, much remains to be done in this important area.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Debt" tried to look closer to home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Just a few weeks ago, Mr. gromashevsky still lived alone in his apartment in montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prostate cancer, разрушавший it from within, gave him a reprieve for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was given five years, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the runaway-house palliative care виктор-гадбуа in belœil, where arrived the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease does its work: unbelievable weakness, which does not give yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sitting at a table, on which is a delicious lunch, he surrenders and agrees to have helped him to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He бодрится, even manages to smile, talk to strangers work around him, bring him drugs, lead him into the bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Courage in a death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the staff found the cure of this malaise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"During the life we are taught that a man must urinate standing," said Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the runaway-house виктора-гадбуа.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regress to the child - for some an unbearable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It all depends on the ability of people to come to terms with the decline in", "he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, in the opinion of many people, dealing with паллиативным departure, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Patients who come in palliative shelter виктор-гадбуа all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">The forecasts were taken to a maximum of three months of life.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses does not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ms. and. 89 years, most feared to die "in the minds of suffocation."</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease has allowed me to know their children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good kids," she added.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I don't want anything in life," she said, before being allowed to put her mask, облегчающую breath.</seg>
<seg id="27">She will continue in the coming days, his son's last visit приехавшего from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the runaway-house виктор-гадбуа with a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can be done.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make the death more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec for every 11 700 people are one place in the institutions of palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">This very little, given that, sooner or later, we are all dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel is one of the doctors shelter.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whether the comfort of a physical, emotional or soul.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Dying we agree to provide ротовые protect of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he will ask.</seg>

<seg id="38">Yesterday evening we brought beer. Mr X, who died today at night.</seg>
<seg id="39">His son допил this beer in the feet in the late in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help the relatives, as well as patients," says natalie savart, Director of patient care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the runaway-house виктор-гадбуа no one day is similar to the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to 93-летним man, who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, seated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, young people die tragic 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and перепробоваший all, in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," is concerned about the Christian says Dr. Martel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients, taken to the shelter виктор-гадбуа, come out of the House, and 47% from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to паллиативному care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to паллиативному care, i.e. to care that is provided, to alleviate the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the runaway-house.</seg>
<seg id="47">And some institutions, such as the shelter виктор-гадбуа society and palliative care at home of Montreal, are more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is this big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in паллиативному care to fear the law, легализирующего эвтаназию and help in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since October circulates manifesto, signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. балфуром маунтом and Dr. Bernard ляпуантом and endorsing the their disagreement with this initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr Christian Martel, Quebec health system not effective enough to secure the right to high quality palliative care before will be allowed a transition to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently," she says," I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to facilitate them.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am afraid that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she was exhausting chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my онкологу that I 'D stop treatment, she said that she regrets that I' D stop me struggle," she said.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the same time she told me itself, that my days are numbered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No all-powerful care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank medical staff, for what they did not fulfil their request, after the team of паллиативному care makes it easier for their pain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain.</seg>
<seg id="60">According to элси Monroe, director for паллиативному care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to обезболиванию in 8% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, all the time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">It cannot be more than to pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.</seg>
<seg id="63">More and more patients, which fails to ease the pain, can have access to palliative sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."</seg>

<seg id="33">On a regular basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques дюшено notes with his hand, that his officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but "especially concerned about the role of" elected officials who knew about this scheme, "but not involved in fraud.</seg>
<seg id="35">Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec offers limit to $100 donation parties, but, according to him, it will not change the situation: "as long as we will not strictly limit elective spending, in politics will be dirty money."</seg>
<seg id="37">It requires a full reconstruction of the system of government contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go below; вникнув boldly in the essence of things, we can build a house on a more sound foundation, with the best control and legitimacy."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story and casts shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. дюшено encourages those who laughs, look in its own backyard.</seg>

<seg id="1">"псж - not FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season you in псж have achieved extraordinary scope.</seg>

<seg id="4">This can be explained individual сознательностью, but can - and a new dimension of псж.</seg>
<seg id="5">Profit great players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next I расту with them every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Technicians also brought a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="8">These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And during the match, it's easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything is happening very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I am not распаляюсь.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the very beginning in the middle of the preliminary preparation in the NIF клерфонтене and before my arrival in saint-étienne I always strode forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thus, you benefit from the competition, the Carlo ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">Deposits of this summer in унiкальну not play matches a very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training is very important.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to what a player such as I, poised to be the level and place to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Carlo ancelotti has supported in my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He helps deputy, such as Claude makélélé, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the master of the situation?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti is respect for the maintenance staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today in the first League he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with top clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He worked with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think he will bring new titles Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I had with him was обнадеживающая conversation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I wandered away from a series of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trust me, which he has also explains my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think of the first part of the season псж?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the first League leader Lyon took place we have.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we are still at the ready.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is: we spectacularly have been qualifying in one eighth Champions League Final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to get as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now it may be.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will be able to say their word face to face with a very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to return match in one eighth of the final.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Whether псж can become a first class European club in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="39">He has already has a budget for this...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and secure position in a long-term perspective.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today it is not.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially псж have tools to make the project viable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Not to take the title in the first League, as last season, would be a big failure?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we actual fervently wish to get the world title.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were close to it.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, it was frustrating, because we had all to come to the finish line first.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was a very successful season.</seg>
<seg id="49">We finished it with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.</seg>
<seg id="52">This year, I think, everything will be fine.</seg>
<seg id="53">In spite of the fact that in the fight for the title have taken such a strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think, that we have the power to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media are too much from псж?</seg>
<seg id="55">It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.</seg>
<seg id="56">We fully prepared for this.</seg>
<seg id="57">On the other hand, when we home выигрываем 4-0 against troyes and we still find for that раскритиковать, of course, it's a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">We wonder what the first people expect from us.</seg>
<seg id="59">We can never win every weekend with a score 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We do not FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to introduce the game.</seg>
<seg id="62">The team is formed from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="63">We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester United, which is already two season fails to pass in one eighth of the final, although they too have spent huge amounts of money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead of you already to winter перерыву.</seg>
<seg id="66">It would disregard for our opponents and for the French.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new псж.</seg>
<seg id="68">It shows how fascinating first league.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we will be able to smile and say to yourself, in May that, despite all the difficulties, we won as a result.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">псж, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Well, if we say that there is a "златанозависимость."</seg>
<seg id="72">This only means that ibrahimović very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">It has come to this and he proves that he first League star.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he is a great player and star on a global scale.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Group we respect him as a person and as a player.</seg>
<seg id="76">He respects people who surround it, too.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he did, it's really only.</seg>
<seg id="78">It stimulates and others to improve their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also encourages all to move forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you have євро-2012 from French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As frustration.</seg>
<seg id="82">I earnestly wish to participate in the euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there many things, and I came out stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I can play good qualifier matches.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is what I hoped since my baptism in blue.</seg>
<seg id="87">We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and must now behave образцово.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you think about the first months of Didier дешама чолі blue?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">They advance for him.</seg>
<seg id="90">He has a good position in qualifying for the group to the world.</seg>
<seg id="91">He strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">What was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I wouldn't want to compare.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has reached its goal, he has qualified us in the euro.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier deschamps will blue in Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">A deserved draw (1-1), вырванная on October 16 in Spain - is a fundamental match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This match gave us confidence in themselves.</seg>
<seg id="98">Each fought for all.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A complete contrast to the current currency exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between receiving the parties C Commission fees for processing them.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, bitcoin, invented сатоши накамото (a pseudonym), at the same time is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure exchange of bittorrent protocol, which allows you to exchange files between members of one level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">About 200 000 operations have already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand sites беруть биткойны for implementation of donations or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Course биткойна, reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before to return today to about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in his report about virtual currency, published in October, interest in the system.</seg>
<seg id="10">He describes биткойн as "the most successful virtual currency," "rival the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."</seg>
<seg id="11">биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "credits" used to advance in the video game, which made during the game or who may buy (and sometimes and exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the operation of exchange controls and always handled any central body.</seg>
<seg id="14">In биткойн all web sites are also holders of accounting books, auditors, currency issuers, покупателыми and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How is this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each deal between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only payment for each new user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A set of information related to this transaction, signed by equipped, using encryption system with a key.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network also can verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to змісту file, possibly to check that биткойны, used in the deal, really exist in public accounts book, разосланной across the network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The key hurdle is the registration of new transactions in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">It passes through the mathematical task разосланной computers, decided that, like a central bank, receives the privilege to add this new line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is about phase hashing file conversion, then there is a large file in a digital signature, a short and unique.</seg>
<seg id="24">Computers "adopt" a new transaction and add to her room, before the "хэшировать" all together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the number, which will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">As soon as this number found other nodes can easily check that it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is thus нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If to obmana користувач very fast (less than ten minutes) would have wished to pay twice one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would have been confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, determined to task, receives 50 биткойнов.</seg>
<seg id="30">To avoid inflation, награда regularly is divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of биткойнов in circulation therefore limited to 21 million, but they делимы until one стомиллионной that leaves another reserve...</seg>
<seg id="32">The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The network already has had its ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sites that provide services bitcoin were attacked, and биткойны were stolen from reserves.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Used a defect does not apply to the Protocol," says Pierre нуаза, who recently launched paymium - company осуществляющую payments real money using network bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also reported about possible money laundering through this this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">But cash also have this disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as блог-платформа wordpress, their permit.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, ADI Shamir and dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and found that almost 80% биткойнов are not in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Giant sales-outs" were announced in November.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," rejoice Jon холмквист, working in coinabul, which focuses on the conversion биткойнов in gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre нуаза, another author of the allowance for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as the operating networks.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of credit cards (in real money) or, payment via mobile phone, but it uses bitcoin образуемый transactions, thus getting cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">The owner of better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not need to install new hardware or software.</seg>
<seg id="47">Only enough to address, which can be "photograph and recognize" phone, clarifies Pierre нуаза, reassuring that he has already thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Before bitcoin settles itself, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.</seg>

<seg id="3">French troops had left his area of responsibility in Afghanistan (kapisa province and суроби).</seg>
<seg id="4">NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not relying only on us.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US suffered mostly Afghan peasants, which we regard as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and покалеченными.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban is made up of Foreign extremists, the former commanders, скрывающихся in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it was in the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are suffering, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will behave more delicately.</seg>
<seg id="11">The withdrawal of French troops from bases ниджраб, which I watched from the heights of hills засаженных almond trees with French credit, took place in the order.</seg>
<seg id="12">Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being атакованными.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">By the end of 2014, the Taliban will not be in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">Circumstances have changed since their overpowering promotion from 1994 to 1996.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kabul was empty at the time, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.</seg>
<seg id="16">The capture of them under the control of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.</seg>
<seg id="17">Afghan women - paid for bigotry these farmers, in which they were al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and in our days.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former Mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a state of dependence.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main characters in the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have become the speculators, exciting, public lands to resell them under development immigrants, returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American субподряда contracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">They discredited; most of them, by the way, even the not fought.</seg>
<seg id="22">People, as I have heard in rural areas, would want a government that was not of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave, as leave those who managed to American generosity: capital outflows substantial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">They lived in the modern world in the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is necessary to provide jobs, these young people, who do not want to return to мракобесию old parties, nor the corruption of some leaders.</seg>
<seg id="29">Everyone, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap opera, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At the moment the army is.</seg>
<seg id="31">The government, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">The old commanders ведшие anti-Soviet struggle, already taking measures to restore provincial guards, who would not abide by the central authorities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be to a certain extent децентрализован, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the election, stated in April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">Industry was not put on their feet, no dam функціонує, no ирригационная system is repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">All imported; nothing is done, except for fruit and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The priority given to private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would be required.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral riches.</seg>
<seg id="41">It only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to their own.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to their export through the mountains, no mining.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have almost pokinuli copper deposit of months айнак, leaving international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) dogs величезний Buddhist complex and remain the most major employers province.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is also necessary that in one day by the Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports have restored normal relations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Difficult birth Constitution Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This is a risky step President Mohamed morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play vabank.</seg>
<seg id="4">Finding all by surprise, on Wednesday, he announced that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a week ago, the Head of State has provided the Assembly two additional months to finish the job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on the preliminary text, in which several times were introduced amendments that weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative only increased the division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to his opponents, the President is determined in his "автократическом breda," continuing "to violate the word" and "violated the right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the camp of his followers are confident that this way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.</seg>
<seg id="10">The referendum should be held within 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon the intention to explain to Egyptians text, Article after Article.</seg>
<seg id="12">The President is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mohamed morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in one interview us weekly time.</seg>
<seg id="14">The more that call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum, the Egyptian people," or you голосуете for my text, or I leave himself extraordinary powers," which, as expected, will be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, for the most part, the Islamists, voted yesterday in the text.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most Liberals have not responded to the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, have they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to братьям-мусульманам.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is no wonder that, in most cases the articles were проголосованы unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few differences emerged around day... time for prayer, as some members of the committee concluded that the hours of the constituent assembly were incorrectly configured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was yesterday still voted on, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The international spotlight, Article 2 eventually remained identical to the article of the constitution of 1971, reading, that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">салафистские party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would give the possibility of their more rigorous application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy," meet the Liberals, who see in this a PR.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They point out in particular to Article 220, which grants al-Azhar university advisory role, in particular, with regard to verify compliance with sharia laws.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the expert on Egypt Sophie pommiers, it is alarming, that to." people to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."</seg>
<seg id="31">We can observe the emergence of theocracy."</seg>
<seg id="32">Many Liberals, in addition, взбудоражены fact that the next President of this university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, is not улемы, and people with a university education, some were taught in the French system "- reassures Alexis блое, which prepares thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he admits that "around Article 220 may be the ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, ") ED.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future may be wondering how civil judge competent to make decisions about it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to their religious aspect, text, adopted yesterday, is being criticized because it gives broad powers of the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brotherhood say they significantly reduced compared to what were under the old regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another controversial issue: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in Parliament and in the national defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">It also will not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The past also expressed concerns about the text, which they see as detrimental to freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now is an insult, that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, none of the articles more said about protecting women, emphasizes хеба мораеф, of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in the Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">The word, which was in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">At the same time as the Egyptian President was to play last night on TV, strikes are planned today in the second half of the day.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">Experts analyzed the statements of the Ministry of the Interior and rosstat криминологическую literature and open data portals on arms issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Most of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all the weapons on the black market was there "to the officials, whose work connected with weapons," the report says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places armed conflicts, 14% of cases occur theft on stage production of weapons, 5% fall on the "black archaeology."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="37">Retail assistant one of weapons stores, who asked not to be identified, said that the weapons found black копателями, long ago nobody buys is too old.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">In the last days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in department stores of Walmart and fast food restaurants popular networks, such as "McDonald S", "Burger King," "taco bell," "уэндис" and "Kentucky фрайд чикен."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">While no one is predicting becomes whether this wave in the ninth shaft or her ñóæäåíî выдохнуться in the early stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Shares support unions and left a number of public organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">But modest wage increase, which receive ordinary workers Walmart and fast food system, the aim of co-sponsors of the protests is the creation of a trade union organizations in them.</seg>
<seg id="7">As long as this sector of the economy almost not immersed in trade union movement.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The campaign began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday," when in America has orgia cheap sales захватившая millions of consumers and sometimes accompanied by потасовками.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some employees of Walmart, in which worldwide employs 2.2 million people left their jobs and пикетировали together with trade unions and leftist activists stores corporation, whose product designed for people on modest and middle income.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many низкооплачиваемые Walmart workers come only in their work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap, partly because there is little pays its workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The past also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of lift trucks or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" required to increase wages and complained to the fact, that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">типичному employee Walmart, получающему $9.5 per hour, this expenditure is not on budget, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase среднуюю salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation in $3.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth at the expense of buyers, then every visit to the store will do their best to 46 cents more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="22">For a year they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more than it is now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that protests have occurred in only nine States and neither малейщего damage inflicted corporation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight Thursday of the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 goods in the second.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total of its cash machines manufactured in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A spokesman for the corporation Dan фогелман argued in an interview ëåâîìó site the huffington post that jobs have left a total of less than five employees of Walmart," and that "protest was simply a" инвестиционный пиаровским gimmick "slaughtering its trade union.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="27">"Free banking!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not object department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore their here as long as no), and "макдоналдсы" and other cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald s says that he sells billions of porcius, and after that he didn't even gives you the hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">джумейн Williams, a member of the city council in New York</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At the moment the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fast food restaurants, over time, its increase, but not much, and their average rank-and-file employees receive $8.90 per hour in New York.</seg>
<seg id="33">In this expensive city no one earns less than them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How can you be in New York on such money for me incomprehensible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Once through the "макдоналдсы" took place almost a quarter of American teenagers who подрабатывали for their прилавками after school, living with parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Few people saw in that the main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now I am constantly наталкиваюсь on interviews with workers "макдоналдсов" who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, the forum newspaper The Wall Street Journal hangeth comment, which the author notes that irresponsible to have children, if you don't know what you are going to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday the "макдоналдса" on 40th street and Madison avenue, demanded that кассирам and поварам fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is more than doubled their present minimum salary.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also demanded that in the fast food were established trade union organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">American law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish the trade union movement activists harassed and layoffs.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the administration rarely makes it easier for them to life.</seg>
<seg id="43">But to cover the trade union fast food is difficult and objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">One of the main is uncommon turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Restless</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Noisy protests took place in this day and have a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highlight of the action was in the middle of the day ìèòèíã макдоналдса near Times Square," on which "have made several local политиков-демократов, in particular, a member of the City Council джумейн Williams, insisted:" McDonald S "says that he sells billions of porcius, and after that he didn't even gives you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Demonstrators have supported and other prominent New York democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of bill de бласио, insisted that "we must all join in support of fast food, so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every нью-йоркец!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">As has described what happened to the New York Times, it was the largest share of this kind in American history of fast food.</seg>
<seg id="50">But there were only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of the rapid catering, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.</seg>

<seg id="1">"So far to fool the brain turns out rough"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Popular among fans of modern technologies тему augmented reality lately taken perceive mainly through the prism of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, in the summer, at its annual conference the current model showed Google, and then it became known that the application for the patent filed in November and Microsoft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But out of the conversation with the head of a group of interactive using 3-d technologies in кэмбриджской laboratory Microsoft шарамом изади suggests that this company for scientists points - the stage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of the virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Tell me, please, in general terms, what goes on in your research team?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We are human interactions with machines, but at the same time try to раздвинуть border this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">As long as mankind in mass застряло at the stage of working with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья fingers in them.</seg>
<seg id="9">We also want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate any fundamental changes in this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, console xbox and kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the xbox today without kinect sold, because all the interesting жестовое management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"What we still lies ahead?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"Despite the fact that kinect suffered interaction at the physical level, much still happens at the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The improved information (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very much.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional display systems on the basis of the various technologies, including проективных.</seg>
<seg id="15">You need to release a computer in our physical world, to make it more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this, however, we need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we can add to the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets virtual reality!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about the voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">A popular thing, but not overestimate her?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is definitely not a panacea - raises the question of privacy, because they don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, to control devices in public places, within which we thought we had project on gestures, but not over размашистыми, and over such скупыми short.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not a camera device but наручным браслетом, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">As long as he's a big, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of the wrist watches.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in general the future for a mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- It's like?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- For example, how do you ask me to give you this bank газировки?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say, and at the same time show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"I usually just say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- That is, you want to make users to adapt under what can or cannot at the moment the machine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more precisely determine human reaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution on depth, this is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"If we talk about your work with sensors xbox kinect, which you have claims to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Don't have permission, depth or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"In principle the current generation is something from which you can start in our work on three dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, it might be to get megapixels 8 with the speed of 1000 to/from.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is not in the мегапикселях themselves, and as a matrix and depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">With the last point of view all current technologies are not good for us - it adds work designers algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="42">You should remember that is not only about the resolution on axes X and y and z.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also very important speed, the number of frames per second.</seg>
<seg id="44">The man is dynamic, and the current 30 to/from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen бетишес of our рэдмондской laboratory made the sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 MS, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everyone understands how this affects the human interaction and machines.</seg>
<seg id="47">I would really have the equivalent of such a device, not only in my work requires касаний frames per second to be more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"And the number of cameras increase does not need?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">"The kinect now there are three cameras, one of which is actually" infrared emitter, "and the second is a receiver reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And here is already the third camera is, actually, a sensor visible range.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.</seg>
<seg id="52">Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or exacerbate it, increasing the volume of payments.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to create a flexible àíàëîã ãðàæäàíñêîìó kinect, play with camber of cameras, and see how it can help in 3D визначенні provisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"As far as I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not presented to the public his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="56">You don't think in terms of daily use augmented reality glasses - it is one of the most promising technology platforms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">"Of course, all the while slob around, holding a smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the steep option would be" переходящая дополненная reality, when "on the basis of cloud platform you could switch to points on a smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="58">Points is a very personal device, in that their strength (private things only see you), and at the same time weakness - дополненная reality on the basis of points you will not work on the virtual objects together with other people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"Imagine for a moment that manipulation of the virtual голографическими objects in the air is available not only Tony старку of" Iron man, "but also a simple upon his death.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is one issue on which often show critics such ideas: no тактильного revocation.</seg>
<seg id="61">Hands feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">"In his lectures I often say that дополненная reality is the seventh in succession a breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think, eighth may well be additive тактильных sensations.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a background for the image.</seg>
<seg id="66">It perfectly captures clicking!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that really are aimed at giving this картинкам "in the air" осязаемости - for example, interference aimed several ultrasound rays to a certain point, where is his finger, gives a sense, but as long as it is very weak - as if you подули on pads.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are and bracelets on the wrist, which affect the nerve endings in the toes is also a promising direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">"And you tried to deceive the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Make him think that he feels that vrode should feel at that moment, when he sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">Is this a good idea, we have not tried to do so.</seg>
<seg id="72">There is one more task, over which will fight for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - work and on the concepts of cross-country tracks don't, such as in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">Yet to fool the brain is rough, work is still very for many years.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's what makes it work on the virtual reality such attractive to researchers - many things absolutely in their infancy.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The head of the main контрольно-ревизионного management: checking шварц-системы failed to the politicians.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Public procurement industry in Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This statement Miroslav kāla, Vice President of the Supreme контрольно-ревизионного management, from an interview for the website aktuálně.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The law will never be perfect, but he must apply correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have," commented on the current situation kāla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">These conclusions provides a joint inspection of Czech and German authorities control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As an example of improper practices are Peter нечаса approach to so-called шварц-системе.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the prime minister said that GDP (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs audits - is it is prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"The law should be installed in any way, and, if he is something bans, and the Prime Minister cannot match the work of the institutions, which are expected to remain check and achieve the fulfilment," concludes kāla.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the ревизионного Committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">What exactly was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">There is a parallel test that we started in mind, perhaps, two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, the question that European law says, how should receive government procurement, it goes on to national legislation and then also applied in practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished inspection revealed the interesting differences - in short, the legislation we have can be "accurate and infallible," but in practice we on some parameters are behind Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It follows from this that it is not enough to create more and more revised rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">As well as this project can help you, what it means for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Such a joint control can contribute to efforts to stop the laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economy means getting appropriate things for a reasonable (but not always) low price, to avoid the enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the fact that we do not reach, lowering the limit orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps this system переполнится "securities" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restriction does not declined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of legislation on public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as функціонує control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is there such an organization as our chickens (контрольно-ревизионное management) or is it works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for institutions, is there as our chickens bundesrechnungshof by on our principle, there is also the Board, is a bit different, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition, the powers of the similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of audit and at the level of Federal Land - in a system that differs from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Brh can manage only federal money, we have state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at federal level calculation chambers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As for local legislation, there is easier than we have?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I wouldn't want to compare without concrete evidence, but in some respects Germany take a model, but you cannot definitely say that it is better in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">So, because they are better with the control?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Definitely not, but again, such comparisons are not like me.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it must be said that even the country's main face many challenges.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">If we talk about domestic legislation, then as reflected on your institution amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow, are the consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that the legal force of the amendments are short, it still doesn't display in our work to control.</seg>
<seg id="35">As we spend control in fact, it is necessary to consider some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Only take this into account in the training of future inspections - we have started to use our new tool "risk detection неэкономности" through which we were taken away almost 14,000 public contracts. We have analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will come, because change restrictions, change the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will justify itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem, which can occur, that is, that the rules "ужесточатся" and it is impossible to comply with them.</seg>
<seg id="40">The functioning of the previous rules by controlled companies intertwined with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programme - with Regional Council) is that any failure to observe the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Whether in such a case, tighten the law in such a way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I don't think this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal error, not trade-distorting for a solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">This system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">And then how to get out of this situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's realize that this path will not anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="47">Recently, the prime minister said that GDP would not bother entrepreneurs audits of so-called шварц-системы, what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">"шварц-система" banned or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">The law should be installed in any way, and, if he is something bans, and the Prime Minister cannot resist the bodies, which are expected to remain to check and achieve the fulfilment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">You can say: "we would change the law and let it," but we cannot say that we pretend that nothing is happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The law on public procurement has a strict rules, how and what must be formally, and rightly so. This will protect public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="52">But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified just because of the formal deficiencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but he must apply correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have.</seg>

<seg id="27">Teachers regularly attend school students інституту едлички and spend with them âåñåëûå and interesting events.</seg>
<seg id="28">The students have no money to go to the teachers, and thus we try to give them the opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the project of additional construction Institute едлички in the future there will be a separate building, in which we переедем with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At every concert nosaukšu several bands and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">What were the selection criteria?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We tried to make the program, which will attract all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, in Prague will chinaski support lesbiens illustratosphere with даном barta, the tap tap, marjan bangor, Morbihan and Jiří souchy.</seg>
<seg id="34">About all the details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.</seg>

<seg id="36">In May, will for the first time to perform on "the Prague Spring festival" and then, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the United States, would like to perform in Washington, D.C. and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The group the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics??</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It's not as scary as it looks at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their child must travel in the luggage compartment, plus to the large number of cargo and boxes with instruments.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, while live up to this without problems. The Czech Airlines čsa and British airlines British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, what I once was.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went off without problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward disabled people and so on.</seg>
<seg id="46">With what you were by now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where everything works better than we have in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still at a basic level.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and here is still in the new independent przesuwanie man in an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also there is shyrokovzhyvanym áàíàëüíûå things such as give way to a disabled person in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, and there are already public organizations, who are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And what, on the contrary, we constantly must catch up with the advanced countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are a lot of things, runlevel which far behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it concerns.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid is normal, that people with severe form of disability to move in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, yes anywhere...</seg>
<seg id="55">There is not much that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, in that we are with the tap tap a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect for the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment, when among us there will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything will change indeed.</seg>
<seg id="57">As long as this single cases - people with a strong will.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The group the tap tap at the present time is very popular, but back on two years ago, that in 1998, you made her to organize?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I entered the Institute едлички as tutor, had a lot of young people around me, who wanted something to do.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I myself a musician and play the saxophone, then along with colleague organized an interesting musical circle.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, but over time, as our lead ладя says angelovič, it is a bit out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or something I путаю?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true, we help that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on advocacy group.</seg>
<seg id="64">We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess, in fact as if there is no.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the European Union means we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Standing in front of you so well turn the tap tap target?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="68">In show business is full of things подражающей one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is logical that all new taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are very few rare things, but I dare say that tap tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, sorry, this naturally...</seg>
<seg id="72">But the pity of completely излишня, because people with disabilities are not some affected and all abandoned by individuals, which we must regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say that if people with disabilities have something it turns out, this shift is not just for them, but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">забезпечив whether success that you are the head of what you consider many?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If we want to do a job properly, we must be in many things бескомпромиссными and hold a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think that this is normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that two times a week should go to rehearsal, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="79">But as happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">At the present time in the group of the tap tap twenty people.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were in the beginning in 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one ладя angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">He will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week at the meeting of the ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth Member of the European Space Agency as a second country of the former eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994, and in the following years, took an active part in a number of projects agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the way to space Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always before found with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let me remind you, for example, of lectures and. штернфельда, which on December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "introduction to cosmonautics."</seg>
<seg id="7">Ideas of a young engineer (1905 born) left the audience only indifferent, after several years of штернфельд recalled that Dr. Jan гадомский was interested in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1934 in France штернфельд won the prize of Robert эсно-пельтри and André Luiz хирша for "introduction to cosmonautics."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan гадомский (1899, 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space science.</seg>
<seg id="10">He published in the Polish magazine wrote a number of books and hundreds of Articles devoted to this scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">гадомский became known worldwide propagandist space science, and his contribution was assessed in including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway draisine, equipped with missile engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clear, even to disperse or braking for carriage was to be used rocket.</seg>
<seg id="15">Information about this дрезине known only from the press of the era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish artillery began to wonder about missile стрелах.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study by the weapons technology in collaboration with professors мечиславом вольфке and Gustav мокжицким.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of the remaining materials research shows that come to the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">But with the arrival of German troops work were interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, in the specialized press appeared the idea of the photovoltaic ракеты-истребителя, which offered рогозинский engineer, and the following year вийшла work "air ракета-торпеда and aviation ракета-бомба" author леливы-кживоблоцкого.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before the war all projects military use of missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy), who coordinated the work.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of his work ended because of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The next scientific work, dedicated to a space superpower, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society astronautics (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 magazine "problems," which are published four long articles on астронавтике.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one of them Professor m. суботович suggested to organize society, which will deal with космонавтикой.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, already gaining momentum проекти artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is a promising industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society astronautics (поа) tried to join the International Federation astronautics (based in 1951), and in autumn поа became its active member of.</seg>
<seg id="29">And next year the first chairman of the поа Kazimierz заранкевич (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 поа contributed to the development of a highly successful meteorological missiles rm (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile выполнившей scientific study.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type rm-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rocket, capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subsequently vibro rm-1а version was built, and in the summer of 1959 on бледовском two-stage missile test rm-2 somehow managed to survive were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was about 1.4 m in length, and her weight was about 11.5 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next version of the missiles was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket rm-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was watching the tall wind.</seg>
<seg id="37">But further development was suspended in 1962.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Heiress first missiles type rm became rocket метеор-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as we use two level, its total length становила 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">There are three types (which are marked as метеор-1а -1в and -1с), which were split of the camera to the scientific equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rocket метеор-1а had space of 0.4 a litre, метеор-1в - 0,34 L, and метеор-1с - 0,62л.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum range of flight for all three types of was 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the period between 1965 and 1968, in the aviation Institute was the development of missiles метеор-2, and its first flight tests started in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Rocket метеор-2 with a 380 kg, was able to cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then were built version метеор-2н and метеор-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">I should also mention the accession of Poland in коспар (the Committee on space research) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee коспар two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, in the framework of the program interkosmos, Poland took part in the research space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir ремека.</seg>

<seg id="1">The law on public works is not a solution to the problem.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision caused жваву дискусію in society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">либерально-ориентированные economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, no private capital limited movement along with raw financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result of the significant differences in labor costs (salaries) чпъойлбеф price tension.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept should be understood condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in economic competition is the fact that "" the cost of a competitor to pick up a greater part of the market, and thus increase their own income.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries where labor costs, compared with other high.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including and grow for manufactured them unemployment, the inevitable government spending on social needs.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of masters entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social, economic and social damage inflicted by them in pursuit of profit.</seg>
<seg id="13">The situation is so well known that need no specific statistics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private capital бесцеремонные methods are at the level of individual economies situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially reduce social level of its population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments give their own population at the mercy of the private capital, despite the social decline.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected primarily in changes of the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is economically make their ​ ​ people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This acts as a system of economic coercion in case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting rights of workers in the field of labour legislation.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of the increased level of poverty and, together with the and the difference between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the Federal Republic of Germany for a few years there is public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves their own labor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of these people are already approaching one million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy are constantly cases when трудоустроенные people get a salary, that the state should they доплачивать so that they received прожитковий мінімум.</seg>
<seg id="23">A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic measures in almost all the southern States of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same state, in which people who are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on нищенскую salary on the margins of society in the hope that one day in the country will come private investment capital.</seg>
<seg id="25">But it's asked, how did he take?</seg>
<seg id="26">If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, марокканец египтянин African still works for a share of European wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theory and the media to nausea, argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not morontia actions to intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now almost хртбчмсаэйк policy and to the entire state, in its own selfish purposes?</seg>
<seg id="31">A clear answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of the almighty and omnipresent lobby in almost all countries.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result we have a hopeless situation, проявляющуюся in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is such that public ministry due to lack of funds is assigned to develop bills private law firms, which are tightly linked with industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then these bills argues the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power comes not from the people, according to the constitution of the Western type, and from финансово-мощных groups who want their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is obvious that либерально-ориентированная democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a ​ ​ situation, as described аппианом in work "the crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and pompéia": "the state has long been disintegrated, and agencies are involved in violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bribery and Corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people walked in the election with zaranee sold voice... "" decent people are generally not of them ran for the office of the governor, at the end of the day once the state for eight months left without consul.... "" seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the necessity of finding an energetic person.. appian thought that it would be "pompey, but they became Caesar that finally changed democracy to autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital, already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.</seg>
<seg id="42">The present result is no different from the past: repair the unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.</seg>
<seg id="43">It means that the cause of the fascist and communist regimes we should look for the reckless economic liberalization systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of democracy liberal type can be seen as a pause, after which is expected to be the next tour.</seg>
<seg id="45">First of all, tragically, that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.</seg>
<seg id="46">The law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of competition both on the international and at national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus, this trend is systemic in nature.</seg>
<seg id="49">The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen share state involvement in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the government and private capital will weaken a monopoly position in society in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="5">Some are opting for Israel, defending his position in that it has the right to defend itself, and the Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, defending the racism of the Israeli State, genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel has been attributed to the role of a terrorist state.</seg>
<seg id="6">I don't want to speculate about who in these periodically recurring waves killings, criminal, and whoever the victim, after all, today's Israeli citizens, including самоуправляемые territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and not witnessed the violence began.</seg>
<seg id="7">My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, you look at it, who primarily serve which continues for 95 years of tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of my reasoning backed by historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of mankind is first of all the history of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is not so clear is whether these people are themselves taking their own steps, or for their throne was someone who has guided their actions to advance the set goals.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and проистекающей of these authorities could not happen for the life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among астрономически rich families is one that could be viewed as голова спрута (do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many do not write about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 1990s, 19th century, to stop rumors linking their name with criminal actions in higher areas, in the shadow of which they were, and who have always led to strengthen their power, приумножению wealth or at the same time and by then, and to the other.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are stakes in almost all central banks around the world, and against the countries, in whose central banks, they don't have their share of, they do or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the ouster of Qaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has committed his country's central bank in their own hands).</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has tried to resist this family, has died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the Central Bank for ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the Civil War, he began to produce their own (понимай - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. deputy Luis mcfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Their thirst for a world power in the period from 1859 in 1871 led to developing the plan of three world wars, created by the great Mason 33rd level Al пайком.</seg>
<seg id="22">The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and a third should lead to reduce world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything else, except as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final capture of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">A method by which has a team of the richest families headed by ротшильдами, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - order out of the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">But these decisions are false and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which is supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing габсбургского heir Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, by Bolshevik революциию.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended a sudden, unjustified in warrior and economically капитуляцией Germany (there was no longer necessary war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of central European powers, Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">To facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, bankers and policymakers have created a latent conflict situation, once in Germany huge war reparations, which created the background to radicalization of impoverished masses, then was only given the Germans are strong, обличающего guilty and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played function fifth column, in sparking the fire of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked a foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The declaration of the Balfour Declaration created a premise of the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to be the first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to estimate, released the Hitler of chains, in which his holding bankers, or whatever he did was originally planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews to concentration camps have created conditions for recognition of the Jewish state the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as Germany was caused by the military репарациями on 2-ю World War II, the state of Israel was proclaimed a war, to create the third.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers would unleash the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, it will become a victim of fighting on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people on supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is to blame, and who is a victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the insult breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their commitment to the global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We must distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like the US, international bankers подсовывают people for voting in the election solely its own candidates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu Hawk is a typical example of fascist, loyal international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the ормузским strait, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (ship corridor is just 2 miles wide)," also will lead to the destruction of the world economy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In which light now are words, spoken by David рокфеллером in 1994: "all that we need is a crisis, and people will take a new world order."</seg>
<seg id="39">The new world order in their view is the world masters and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy наслаждающейся comfort.</seg>
<seg id="41">World where everyone born the body at birth имплантируют chip, with whom he becomes the creature, which is under total control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on his right hand or on the forehead of the stigma, so that a person who is marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could not buy or sell.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is the wisdom: anyone who has the mind can calculate the number of the beast.</seg>
<seg id="44">For is it name human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film "operation" ARGO ": when worse could cause Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed резы shāh, an escaped after the revolution in the United States, which had been the patron saint of his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The US administration for the positive outcome of the situation not предполагался - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">But to achieve liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to a теократического regime, she was not able to.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was reinforced by the unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after talks brokered by the Algerian Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their fate has brought home a wave of solidarity and антииранских sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election 1980-го року, completed election of Ronald Reagan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film, срежессированный actor Ben affleck "operation" ARGO "describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">After the complex changes they finished their way to the residence of the Canadian Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, while helped экстравагантная legend cover, according to which they went to Canadian паспортам as members of the crew, подыскивавшие place in the country for filming научно-фантастической epic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan, which invented the expert "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">To the legend was reliable, in journals wrote about the film project, устраивались press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were kept a secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The film аффлека is a combination of several genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "фильм-киноопус," the story of a successful затеи, fraud is an example can be a number of films about the ocean's friends.</seg>
<seg id="20">The film is constantly changing mood - on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes of Tehran's (the титрах shows significant historical photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film, big differences in this not).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, пересекающиеся with irony and moderate exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating table, the stairs institutions, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben аффлеку admirationful managed to make рестарт career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From высмеянного actor has become a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Operation" ARGO "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, baby, goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" the city "(2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, this is the first film аффлека, which remains in the hometown of director - Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">A sense of atmosphere places in this refers to the qualities that возвышали earlier films directed by over Hollywood standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">And affleck it manifests in "ARGO," where Tehran "plays" Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in reconstruction of real events - entrance scenes of the embassy impressive its clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (a fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too many processes in too many places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a variety of exciting scenes cinematographic values.</seg>
<seg id="33">He is quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something додумывает - there's all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents a looming crisis in Tehran's airport and the race on взлетно-посадочной lane look rather надуманно).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The lack of "ARGO" is рассеянность, associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved a larger space, as they do in the film is far from the only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this is a film, which you can watch with moderate interest, assessing performance and ретро-стиль воссоздающий триллеры seventies.</seg>
<seg id="37">But captures with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, this is enough for the reminder of the one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated notions of almighty and всезнающих special services.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the previously put forward by the nomination абсурдностей - the recent decision of the European Court on the premium rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until now, women had privileges on life insurance, because they objectively for insurance companies are less prone to risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Further incredible ideas from EU workshop people can advance to the contest before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," said нагер.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The controversial resolutions of the EU is, for example, and compulsory adding биокомпонентов in fuel, that result in harm nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of cages for chickens, with the result that this year, significantly tightened eggs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The criticism was a de facto ban on the use of the term "бутербродное oil" or withdrawal from sale of classical light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Quality bananas must be 14 inches long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Pan-European device often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any State or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat for defends requirements of its banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The lobby is: for example, top quality bananas in the European Union must have been achieved in 14 cm in length and not dare show "аномальную кривизну."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">At the same time the European Commission оправдывалась that only harmonizes existing scattered national rules that осложняли trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The EU, despite the resistance of some States, still has softened standards on the fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to расточению products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate to win in the poll may become and last year the EU, according to which sold balloons should снабжаться warning that children under eight years cannot inflated them without adult supervision.</seg>

<seg id="17">This restriction now apply to children under 14 years old, which is forbidden to blow in the trade fair дуделки.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Funny ideas are born and at home</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">It is absurd and rule, concerning the European officials: anyone who has any official position in the EU, cannot, given the considerate themes for Greece, using the name Macedonia, but must instead say "бюрм" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "principle of non-interference" (admire make), proposed for voting, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, a rule about the amount of food in the EU membership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies, which can stay in the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="22">Subsequently the Czech Republic topped, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Organizers of the questionnaire also are interested in and the idea to pay for some countries for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for a statement about getting subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">The European Union will ask about compensation," said in the fall of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture jaraslau palace (чсдп).</seg>
<seg id="27">As the argument he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called интервенционных purchases of the state was full of warehouses stocks, which had to be taken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to паласу, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the end, the European Commission has gone to the Czech Republic, organizing a tender to buy grain from the countries, which have no access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Subsidies to obtain subsidies offered ñåëàì Ministry for regional development, руководимое Minister Paul German (us-deu), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on making statements on subsidies from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU: bizarre orders are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the resolution in the Member States can easily become an object of criticism, the efforts of the EU for regulation, as well as a more efficient functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU subsidies for projects that have not even hint at something in common with the deepening of the European integration, but which Member States have achieved when discussing the budget.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Causes emotions among Czechs and that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">While the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and австрийцами retained the name "оломоуцкие сырки," but "туземский rum," whose tradition in our country have roots in the 19th century, our producers were to rename the "туземак."</seg>
<seg id="36">Called rum can only products from тростникового дистиллята, not from sugar beet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of registered products the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "фета" and "gorgonzola," марципаном from German Lübeck or пармской ham, have proved to be, for example, karlovy vary breadcrumbs, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and saaz hops.</seg>

<seg id="3">I don't think about how to become the Senator or President.</seg>
<seg id="4">If we had everything in the country function without problems, then I wouldn't be anywhere was running.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can no longer watch over the last 20 years the country разворовывается scurrying around the thieves, as here, people raise taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambition to be a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when I see something that I don't like it, then try to find a solution, as it is to change.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I was four years old and I am an independent person, not belonging to any party, I don't have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of Senator or President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate, you have got, but soon went to the castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Do you not turn this way back to people who you choose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I say all the time that включусь in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, I said that if I am elected Senator, I will run for president.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not a post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I need the greatest influence and vast powers.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not just that we as a nation ропщем have themselves in the bar or the TV, but at the same time ready растоптать any who try to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">Are added to the media, which human очерняют, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiří пароубека.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's get to your views.</seg>
<seg id="19">Struggle for the castle you started with theses about material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the inverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.</seg>
<seg id="20">To do this, we need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have as a President no such powers, and only a Senate may propose laws.</seg>
<seg id="22">As you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">When I as a citizen lobbied that all excursions became free enterprise, it managed to push.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is политиканстве - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately repaired obstacles, and this holds citizens.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent беспартийного person I have much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I have no party раскладывания through, without looking at the tenets of its can take each party what is best for our country, and to apply it.</seg>

<seg id="39">And with that in politics you long not продержитесь.</seg>

<seg id="41">I don't have another opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="42">Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on his side, so we have made his.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="47">Speak directly, that I am an amateur, not a genius and not an intellectual.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="62">I haven't thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past each potential advocate, and I have no money on this.</seg>

<seg id="69">You ride a астон-мартине, own property on 60 million and you have no money to campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money especially to invest in it do not want to.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I should get into debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I invested in a campaign already 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I don't have sponsors, shows that my program not so interesting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Architects mvrdv argue that the real adventures are not only in the popular imagination - for example spijkenisse and his recently constructed book mountain - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I thought this building fun, it looks футуристично, finally we have again you can see something interesting," says лизетте верхайг прохожая on the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Stefan спермон, an expert on it on building located near a large company, believes so: "No, it's really beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?</seg>
<seg id="5">All have the Internet, iPad and electronic books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now nobody voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned library, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, малопримечательному спальному camp under the following ports: Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has a population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To combat this frustrating circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to make a contribution in general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of a spectacularly colored miniatures of reinforced concrete.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of this educational initiative was modest.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">вини Maas of Rotterdam architectural Bureau mvrdv, master of bold столбчатых diagrams and author of the witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, public to the task with his usual невозмутимостью and appeared on a competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And as long as the members of the jury озадаченно looked and shrugged, naughty Maas folded from its original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in defense of his project the following words: "dear citizens!"</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's my proposal: "book mountain" in spijkenisse, the so-called букенберг!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, this mountain cost 30 million euros grew.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, mail and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses in total for 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">In early November," book mountain "was awarded the second prize of the" best library potuyt 2012. "</seg>
<seg id="18">The project also participates in the national Dutch конкурсі wooden structures in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Thus, faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but the postmodern pedestrian zones and surprisingly homely town hall, the white facades which suggest the idea of молокозаводе became richer at one modern piece of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the most important thing - in spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">First impression: книжное Eldorado under the boy in the plastic bubble for cheese.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is only one elevator, taking place in the center of the architecture, because these fans and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.</seg>
<seg id="24">остекленное from all sides room is bright and easily обозримое floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps accurately provide a sense of public town square.</seg>
<seg id="25">Urban environment recreated ideal.</seg>
<seg id="26">View unwittingly looking for the bench, dogs and playing the football of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere - books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Usually bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a dark room, usually неуютный and faceless," says вини Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have a classic configuration space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner space of book mountains used skillfully: in the center of the offices are located, интернет-библиотека, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Especially glad with black bookshelves, which serve the finish of the walls, then the парапетами, лестничными railings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their appearance, texture and smell the unusual.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even sophisticated civil engineers and architects are lost in guessing, what is the unknown material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We were eager to work with secondary materials," explains joop трауборст, head of the project, representing the Community spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And once on a single аграрному enterprise in Friesland we met the by-product of the agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, in greenhouses and on the fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots is an artificial волокнистый material миллиметровой thickness.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and saves time.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textilien serves as a season or two, then it can be to throw out.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library this painting - for the first time in such amounts - was спрессовано in the four centimeter thick.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the influence of the heat and pressure the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, the smell is a little like a new car and a little sneakers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the top are 105 steps.</seg>
<seg id="42">The one who wins over the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary CAFE is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch крокетами and well as trade of its фикусами in pots.</seg>
<seg id="43">They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about the right humidity on literary mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The cost of a new Soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology," says троуборст.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heat is used for the heating and cooling of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although book mountain is under a glass boy in the plastic bubble, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="48">Large farms of клееной wood, placed perpendicular стеклянному facade, provide shade and take up most of the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate in the room is very nice.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest of the protection provide fully automatic rolling curtains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan спермон aforesaid skeptic of areas of it, has already visited the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">лизетте верхайг also was already here.</seg>
<seg id="53">As well as преподавательница traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia bogarde, which called букенберг "soul spijkenisse, which has long been lacking."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from their own meetings.</seg>
<seg id="55">These books were to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully укомплектованной library - at the time it was 70.000 books.</seg>
<seg id="56">The idea worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">Shelves заставлены up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than полупустая library," says the architect вини Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that, thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with the new home.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if it is only for decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">Thus, mvrdv managed to solve Royal task, which on the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">And they are very young and необразованны.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is only the starting point for building identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "The Germans should play a more important role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the стефена szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin balanced on a narrow the diplomatic track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application to receive observer status at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israelis in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany should be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that the American position, it also does not support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - while not acting too critical toward Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on a forbidden zone for flights.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, NATO held this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact is that it is in the process of its foreign policy, namely passes from the policy, which, so to speak, led us to the German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent edinaya policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that while they only 8 of their role, but are on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy which is France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What exactly is "normal" with German foreign policy point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">This willingness to take in its national interest position, unaffected by the position of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are largely from the interests of other major countries, and that's why Germany must defend their interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Whether these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.</seg>
<seg id="27">So it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, it plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it is not completely one-way communication.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, воздерживаясь when making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States positieve understanding of the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I don't think it was the same dramatic надлом, as in the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Germany may even become so a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that with its interests should be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, by contrast, clearly voted for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European states?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The power of American domestic politics such differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration has sufficient understanding of deep inside the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in connection with the local political situation of the government, of course, cannot openly to hold such a position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that substantial differences of opinion is not as great as always seems to be.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not delighted by Netanyahu policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the most important partner in the EU on the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes the situation a difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there were a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not so.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they cannot act in the broader approach and are forced to act, instead relying only on their own vision of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="48">That's the way they do with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think that in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in building a common European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of ties with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This theme was always delicate.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">If Germany sees itself as an important international player - whether she would take on a really major role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or a leading role still difficult given Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany has not got used to it, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far always difficult is to play a significant role.</seg>
<seg id="56">Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany takes on a role, are very different антигерманские feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">The Germans not just deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="58">Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view Germany is considerably more difficulties than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must take into account the different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">So, the influence of the United States in European politics constantly weakens, but at the moment the EU is not filled the vacuum, who then?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans would just have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you don't like, unpleasant or increases the enmity to you - that's just life.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The protection of trademarks in China:" When PUMA and Armani suddenly become Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is internationally known brand, Polo Ralph lauren, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is the Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is completely officially registered name which has nothing to do with companies in China, from the names of which it formed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Foreigners is becoming harder to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas паттлох, Taylor's lawyer wessing, specializing in the trademark rights violations in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my desk every week appears on the new case of this kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">имитаторам enough to add just a few letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">So from Gucci виходить lu-gucci, instead of Prada can be registered prada-kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods manufacturer PUMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">паттлох opens the folder with records відомства registration of trademarks in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered the trademark zegna df PUMA, artificial name, in which used the name of the fashion house ermenegildo zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese - world champions on copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities there is a multilevel department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.</seg>
<seg id="16">However справи паттлоха not such. On behalf of their clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises are officially received from відомства registration of trademarks right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call it "banne минпай" марка-пассажир.</seg>
<seg id="18">This word is associated with "banne дакуань."</seg>
<seg id="19">So called women who are hunting for rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It damages the business, with the need to fight," óáåæäåí паттлох.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While trademark, a unique position is lost, image suffered tremendously."</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive копируемых products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the company by market research clsa, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest and the fastest growing market for luxury goods.</seg>
<seg id="25">But to remove shady records in the register trademarks is difficult, and is it's expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="27">паттлох tells about matters, in which the Court rejected claims, as at the end of a long time опротестованное name became "reality of the market."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the complainant not lucky, he will have to pay even плагиатору, as a damaged the his trade sign in China, says паттлох.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there is governed by the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also the famous case of graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 the company Daimler lost a court dispute with manufacturers of construction machinery sany, enterprise, which shortly before acquired фирму-производителя бетононасосов putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star Mercedes.</seg>
<seg id="33">купившая Volvo company Geely originally used сине-белый logo, напоминавший BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.</seg>
<seg id="36">The registration of trademarks ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and equipment приміщення there had been difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="37">But in the past year was "return from an emergency situation in the process to normal."</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the number of rough affairs возражениям decreased by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production department.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To deal with this is expensive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year the ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This record and means that China for the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations worldwide, the agency reports.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same goes for total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 was paid out 1.8 billion yuan fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">If simplify, this means that each Registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Appeal against it is worth many times more, as it shows the German family enterprises freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, the concern is fighting against the Chinese плагиатора.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans have managed to ensure that the illegal production of them fake auto parts was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="51">But copycat secured a Chinese rights to trademark freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">It was their own omission, since the names in Germany are not subject to protection, says hanno вентцлер, chairman of the board of freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim мюнхенцев.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, in both the following entities freudenberg won, but nasty party continues to struggle so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">You need to be on the alert</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the question is pending in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">вентцлер hopes to bring it to a conclusion and praised the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and we take a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">Domestic spending is unlikely to succumb to the accounting firm, the archive had to view even acts of a hundred years old, to give evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago freudenberg no results suggested the loathly side of the "great шестизначную amount in euro" for settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"It is clear how costly it we should," says вентцлер.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Dangers of Far East threatened to break out even in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Namely, if imitation of зарегистрируют there for an unprotected trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="64">So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"We need to be on the alert," says вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer паттлох recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "anything that in any way is to protect, to register also in China," says вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can do much more expensive than registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed, if freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about a sign, you will have to pay the loathly side licensing fees for its own name, explains вентцлер.</seg>
<seg id="71">Otherwise we will from the market in the dark segment.</seg>

<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important, sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial STI as syphilis, Chlamydia and триппер (гонорею).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral stds are HIV, the human папиллома-вирус, genital herpes and hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">лобковый педикулез and scabies refer to паразитарным stis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What are the main поражаемые group?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea found mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sex between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">The heterosexual adults often встречающимися diseases, passed sexually transmitted infection, are хламидийные трихомониаз candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human папиллома-вирус.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections occur in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the youth хламидийные infection are significantly more often than among other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">We have among young people also often found human папиллома-вирус.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As change the number of cases of infection?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all, sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections in 2007 reduced.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about a tenth lower than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the symptoms point to венерическое disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">When infectious diseases may arise ulcers in the field of genital mutilation, complaints by мочеиспускании чщдемеойс, abdominal pain at the bottom, as well as the bubbles or sealing.</seg>
<seg id="55">But often they are not accompanied by migraine and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is partly the bacteria sexually transmitted diseases, can also spread through contact infection and in close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">That's why experts recommend regular inspection, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">With early detection can cure most stis and avoid remote consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Patronage, choir and not least fees for speeches throughout Germany allow something to collect donations.</seg>
<seg id="62">"All we were sent to эситжени already about 200 000 euros," says аннете леннартц, Chairman of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village of money from Germany manages цодва Dlamini, conscious and active woman.</seg>
<seg id="64">She also cares about making orphans were well organized, for example in one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">гогос, as they are known in зулусском old women, is the backbone of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them took to himself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and take care of that children in the form of every day in time appeared on the lessons.</seg>
<seg id="67">Those who have not left home, go to the shelter to ханийсиле, lonely woman, receives a salary from associations, as well as two cook, who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, the association "voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, constructed two курятника and together with American Health Organization for PSI organized surrender analysis on HIV for many residents of the village.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer deep silence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The King with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says аннете леннартц, "because it is associated with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Quite unusual for a country in which the King has officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King mswati III, is known for its love of excesses.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, on such a санкционированном державою style of life also lays the blame for what ич virus has spread so quickly in the past years.</seg>
<seg id="76">But she is also a stray workers who carry the virus in the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms are literally on every corner, says аннете леннартц," but they almost do not use.</seg>
<seg id="78">Another culture - the flesh to flesh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To a little support cultural exchange, choir ибмогни every two or three years is travelling to South Africa and singing songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many in the South region of the black continent know since the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">The bus, full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that has happened, there were tears in the eyes of the border guards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The trip also always results in эситжени, where singers відвідують sponsored children.</seg>
<seg id="82">In spite of the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the valley of эцулвени it more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Go in эситжени, there is light," say the people here. "</seg>
<seg id="84">But after 8733-километрового flight back in Heidelberg, when топающие singers return to репетиционный facilities on the street бергхаймер, you can see that this light burns here as well.</seg>

<seg id="16">I try to a couple of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">If we manage to carry a piece of the nose, that things are not so bad - differs little from pieces of sushi, which you long were taken to a bus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">ракфиск poverty is the product of the different times, times, when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish in the autumn замачивали герметически closed barrels with salt water.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Mr. peña nieto has developed to such statements next to the President of the United States a political career as Governor of his home state of Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his homeland, the country ' s populous and vast state, the capital of the country, opinions about the new leader was split.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">"We have come to associate with him hope for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel ольвера Hernandez, Congressman from state headed by peña nieto институционно-революционной Party (PRI).</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">According to opponents of Mr. peña nieto, about it in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as Governor, he was not able to cope with the problem of murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the worst case, however, his administration has been accused of complete disregard for the problem.</seg>

<seg id="42">They want people to simply take the faith of all, what they say, and помалкивали.</seg>
<seg id="43">But it is wrong, so you can't, especially when around so many violations and transatlantic," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">By putting on a presidential sash on Saturday, President of peña nieto together with it will take a hard responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">For the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected crimes associated with violence, and the new President promised to make a solution to this problem a priority during his presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that he will be exactly the same President, what was the governor," says ольвера, Congressman from валье-де-браво PRI.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My crisis of national self-determination - the story of American of Mexican origin.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to use themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they resemble the residents of a country of difficult times.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Ruben наваретте believes that Mexican American origin torn between two cultures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">During a recent trip to Mexico I passed through the corridor for arriving, approached the border control and remained in place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs point to two lines: one for mexicanos (Mexican), the second for extranjeros (foreigners).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and my whole life called мексиканцем.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves ирландцами, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I stopped on a complex structures "American of Mexican origin."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here I was in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need to conditional names or complex constructions.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.</seg>
<seg id="15">But my vocabulary are poorer than the speakers, and I cannot get rid of American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I pulled out his American passport and was in turn for extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique peña nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were familiar to meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The President of peña nieto willingly spoke about the rise of Mexican economic, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to move to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He wants to sign the agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, President of peña nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have sounded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">For Mexico's relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans do not think about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and at the barrel rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Mexicans have for centuries, rather than minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So is only a statesman us обмолвиться though word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately hear complaints about what Americans посягают on the sovereignty of its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the descendants of montezumae преисполняются militancy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The most complex are Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you want to talk about insults?</seg>
<seg id="29">Their enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people who are in this country for a possible, and those for whom no such opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point, their family history êòî-ëèáî - father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">Most often it was certain kinds of Mexicans - смуглые, no education, from poor peasant families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We their descendants, and we remember about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mexico, see it differently.</seg>
<seg id="35">Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and made ourselves comfortable on the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our national self-determination запутано and it is unclear, but we know what kind of state as its.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States of America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we know that the majority of Mexican elite and the ruling class we do not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">We respond to them the same.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a reminder about humiliating defeats that happened and refer to us as a second-class, how to ненастоящим Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are not good enough say in Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Our very existence for them due to failures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.</seg>
<seg id="44">We wouldn't have been now for silk curtain, found in the United States сытую life, but having lost spiritual connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife was born in Guadalajara and легально moved to the United States even in childhood, and it reminds me of that between справжніми Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, there are certain friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin, it is a shame.</seg>
<seg id="46">She believes that belongs to both these countries and a citizen of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">At the same time, many of my friends of Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to any one of them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We listen to the Mexican band Los tigres del north, but love and Bruce спрингстина.</seg>
<seg id="49">Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose the roots.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we call Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship without that not enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals to restore relations with the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want the Mexican Americans worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We could tell their друзьям-американцам about which it is a beautiful country and how cool it is to attend, and might be persuaded to political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Yes, of course.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nothing will happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too much offense in the past.</seg>
<seg id="58">And, given the gap between rich and poor, raging corruption and the drug trade, many of us does not believe this country so great.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, амигос.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">And this is true.</seg>
<seg id="61">If part of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States that, as they have done with Mexico century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in grievances over how recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The old battle on the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas group can become fragile foundation for further Peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Possibility of lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound, which have become the usual meaningless debate about who first started; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном conflict in the Middle East came changes.</seg>
<seg id="7">To this can be treated differently, but events of the "Arab Spring" закружили in rebellious storm many well-established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis could not stay away from the vortex потрясшего region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons, giving hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war without winners</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, this situation does not give cause for optimism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire agreement which was signed on 21 November, will be performed, the clashes this week only lent by the officers on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which took power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, заявят from that they forced Israel to back down, despite the incurred loss.</seg>
<seg id="14">In spite of the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hamas actually increases its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the now more moderate Fatah movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new powerful and rich friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">возрождающийся regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with support for Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing countries of the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">торжествующие Hamas claim about creating around Israel's Islamic Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, in which rules the paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more происламистские insurgents power is about to overthrow Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king is threatened by Hamas allies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad over morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was the secular dictator, not уделявшим особено support Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, are, in many ways similar to Hamas organization, and their leaders are more prone to populism.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice cannot drown out even to Israel and America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">At the same time, the supporters of the "tough" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms Hamas was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli missile system "Iron dome" has demonstrated its creation and successfully destroyed many of the running costs of Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for diplomacy, the United States remained true to their unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for the beginning of the latest round of violence on Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Another important factor is the economic prosperity in Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">In spite of the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis killed by rockets, produced from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the Wall, which comes to the territory of the West Bank - a large part of unacknowledged Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegitimacy of such actions from the point of view of international law.</seg>
<seg id="31">The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for looming on 22 January elections - joined forces with even more violent conservatives under the leadership of авигдора Lieberman, very comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="32">What is the reason to pander to the Palestinians and give them their own country?</seg>
<seg id="33">If to give in their hands all power in the West Bank, whether they will run out of missiles toward Israel, as do their brethren in Gaza?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps, supporters of the "hard line" victorious; however, their estimates can be disproved the Arab Spring.</seg>
<seg id="36">With the Islamists, who came to power in Egypt and other countries, are not very warm feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Defense of Israel's budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.</seg>
<seg id="38">Outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments to strengthen its own economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pragmatism, Egyptian President morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on ceasefire, is a good sign and could spell the beginning of change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Israel, in not less, should take into account the long-term effects of their policies.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the democratic change in Arab countries, the Palestinian right to self-determination is a bomb ticking, which sooner or later explode in the Israeli occupied territories, like автобусу взорванному in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">Repression has undermined the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbate these problems.</seg>
<seg id="43">For violent operations, which are held every few years on the territory of Gaza to crush Hamas movement, have to pay a growing discontent with the international community.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need in the external pulse</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It remains the only solution to which constantly call for sensible representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education two states and territories concessions to Israel in exchange for security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hope, not too impressive in the short term," hope that the cease-fire will enable other countries more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt, which has a long time to decide to cut off supplies of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position, in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967 with the exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah movements.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote in the UN, the result of which can become a virtual Palestinian statehood recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Their role is to engage Israel to the negotiating table, and President Obama should play.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">After returning to the White House, he continued to show an unwillingness to connect to solving this problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">This drastically недальновидная position.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In addition to the different images and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the atrocious, introduced in mandatory with this Saturday - the names of brands, which printed the same fine print.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the most severe conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Federal Government of Australia declares that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of a lifetime fashion status.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basis for this decision was based on the results of the research, показавших that people, not started smoking to 26 years in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning, who are trying to bring tobacco company with the help of packaging," explains Health Minister tanya плиберсек, citing research, that, for example, the Crown in Ken logo is associated with the idea of the Princess in children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes are not particularly affect on profit multinational corporations, but the possibility of such measures are already considering and other countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tobacco companies argue that this would only increase the black market, which will be sold on the cheap and affordable cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his pioneer," said Scott mcintyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.</seg>

<seg id="16">According to Sandra ḫāʾ, company zico already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us it is good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among a part of the population, to which used these measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">After making a series of television advertising laws, which make illegal cigarettes in Australia and support their sports events, as well as prohibiting salemans to cigarettes in a visible place, advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian Government banned local companies and websites to advertise on the network, but it cannot limit in this foreign sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet sounds very attractive," explains becki freeman исследующая public health issues at the University of Sydney.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="22">Freeman says growth in the number of reviews on торгові марки, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in social networking sites, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="23">The question is whether this is the work of private citizen, who loves marlboro cigarettes, so much so that did not spare time and energy and made the video, or is behind this campaign?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">Australian department of the British American Tobacco company argues that the industry is now busy adapting to the new rules, more than advertising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States are laying claim to the World Trade Organization, declaring that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relations with Australia are poor.</seg>
<seg id="26">The WTO is expected by the end of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to tanya плиберсек, government обсуждало with other countries to make their similar laws on the packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In 2001, Canada first introduced compulsory placement of photographs, warning about the dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it is a rule made in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">The possibility of a tightening of laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connection - it's not so bad.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, and because of our aircraft revealed the mechanical problems and it was replaced by another plane, which we have to.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I won't lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - It's really boring, and there is not much help books, magazines, nor the iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But recently, more and more scientists and experts in child development argue in favor of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss not so bad.</seg>
<seg id="8">It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because in the modern world, we are always in some of your screen, the benefits of boredom are past us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Maybe we need to strive for boredom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And at the same time, there is no.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will come back to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before I, like many others, believed that boredom - the invention of the relatively recent times when people have more free time.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is not the case, argues Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history Canadian University of Calgary, the author of the book "a fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a enjoying history, Yale University press, 2011).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact boredom boasts a very ancient history," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the walls in помпеях found Latin inscription of boredom, reports dating to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At the same time it remains an open question as to how we understand boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York In Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often transform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Having studied materials research on this topic and asking the question target group in 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people want, but cannot do that," that would bring them satisfaction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The difference between boredom and апатией, he says, is that скучающий man is not doing something that would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">When apathy do anything I don't want to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The main in experienced boredom, he says, it is a "violation of attention and associated with this deterioration in sentiment and feeling that time is slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The description of the boredom can seem very similar to depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood said that despite the possible connection between these .מצבים скучающие people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people undergoing depression, see the problems in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes it seems to us that we bored, when in fact we just difficult to focus on something.</seg>
<seg id="27">In his study "the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the Journal perspectives on psychological science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, which participants listened to the recording of the voice, reading a magazine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some participants also heard loud noises not related to business programs included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly hear, and a third group listened to only record voice without any sound track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those participants who heard a low volume, noted that they were bored, most - it was hard to concentrate them, but they did not know the reasons for this and it is attributed to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says mark J. фенске, Associate Professor of neurology at the University of гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, when we do something неинтересное," for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on line in search of marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">It is believed, he continues, that when people start покачиваться on a chair or to draw a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions not just help to relax physically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The study found that children who do not prohibit fidget and go round, learn and remember more information, better than children, from which require sit tight," says Professor фенске.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In some moments we all feel bored: delay in flight (as in my case), listening to dull speech, looking through неинтересный film.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, different people have different levels of propensity to boredom.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 1980s to measure such individual features researchers have developed a special "scale propensity to boredom."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and approval, for example," much of what I have to do, однообразно and monotonously "or" me too much interesting, so on that does not have time. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of these questionnaires, the researchers determined that the boys are bored more girls," says Stephen воданович, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida," particularly if there is a variety of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But on the whole teenagers often are bored at all.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991. Reed larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents or eight times a day.</seg>
<seg id="41">He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said they bored in school and during homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The only 3% of parents have noted that it is boring.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor larson said that he had no information about what would such data about boredom now, 21 years later.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, he knows that "in adolescence have to peak propensity to boredom," mainly because children and teenagers do not allow the full address, than they do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Let's get back to my original question: boredom is useful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes there is no, because the most extreme, she, as research shows, can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor воданович посвятивший study this problem more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"So our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.</seg>
<seg id="49">But this is the brain does not always knows what to do better.</seg>
<seg id="50">If you will be bored and you direct this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, if you only get to watch TV, you will be better for some time, and it will take place soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, it ceases to be bored, but he could learn to deal with boredom independently or in any way any other way to manage their time and employment," said Professor фенске.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">"And skills such independent regulation used in various situations," he says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Your child is studying not only occupy themselves something, he also learns самоконтролю at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think that bored need to somehow praise.</seg>
<seg id="56">But regard it as something bad is not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Rather, it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action, and technology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agree with this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"So, we see that we need more often feel bored, with the boredom is extremely unpleasant, неутолимое desire to do something meaningful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In today's world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when there is a silence, we теряемся and do not know what to do."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">While it is unclear how the new law is applied on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Anthony orozko девятнадцатилетний player football team and a student of public college in the southeast of Colorado accused of committing criminal offences, which has been in that will soon be completely legally throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mr. orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in ламаре and was driving in the car on the prairies near the border with канзасом, when they had been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After police found marijuana in the machine, Mr. orozko came agenda in court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug - minor offences, for each of which причитается a fine of $100 - and set the trial date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"With us are treated as criminals," says Mr orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But does it criminal?</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the uncertainty that has been underway for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law, but from the point of consideration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, already filmed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has adopted a similar measure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police stations have already stopped to nominate charges 21 years of age and older people for possession of small amounts that will be seen as legitimate, as only a couple of weeks of the law will come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider the existing matters related to marijuana, and continue to attract the responsibility for possession of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to mountain areas of the West vote for it, in order to prevent the emergence of new in their places, licensed state shops to sell marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"All of this is growing so rapidly, that I don't even know what to expect next," said Daniel J. oates, the chief of police in the town of aurora in the East from Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also озадачено почесывают head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They will form a licensing rules to determine the order of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other States in settling the problems using marijuana for medical purposes, and now first for entertainment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and Smith, representative of the Council on regulation of alcohol production and sales in Washington State.</seg>
<seg id="17">But now, no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent, to which we could focus," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The legislation of the state of Washington, named i-502 enters into force on December 6 and a whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the government licensing system is not yet, and the right of ownership marijuana already узаконено.</seg>
<seg id="20">But there is a more complicated technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between state regulation of "normal access" to licensed marijuana with bans on trade it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Especially hard to place the licensed companies to trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben livingston, representative of the recently established research group "center of the legalization of marijuana."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21, a police chief oates of aurora city sent to subordinates e-mail message saying that prosecutors will no longer attract persons, under age 21, responsible for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops уличать people in these violations "starting from this moment."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">A police chief oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, in the city выращивающих marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal drug traffickers and distributors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The weld county prosecutor in northern Colorado, Ken buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the use of its people undergo a course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the moment 119 Persons charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"The duty of our institutions - to pursue criminal for actions that are considered to be at the moment they are committed," Mr. buck said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The response was controversial even in places like rural district of Mesa, where participants голосування rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police grand junction, the largest city in the district, no longer has the responsibility of adults for possession of small amounts of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="30">The district attorney pete хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided not to take charges on already open cases related to storage of marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law, as long as it does not change is our primary responsibility," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of Colorado, which took part in the vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of issues of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the confused reaction residents in different places of обнажила ambiguity State relations between the local authorities to experiment with marijuana.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The county prosecutors in this respect there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean macalister, денверский lawyer, representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization to reform marijuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They harassed people for so long that now cannot really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small number of marijuana are as to alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field across the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory легализованной trade, but at the same time they cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Supporters of legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department to give in on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several received wide publicity arrests of traffickers and patients, употреблявших marijuana for medical indications, the Federal Government in most cases gave good trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Agents of the Bureau of narcotics are unlikely to be врываться in house to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly be turning a blind eye to regulated by the state of recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. сабет, a former adviser to combat drug trafficking in the Obama administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Some city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores at the sale of marijuana, and so could not open up earlier than a year later.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, montrose, a town in the western part of the state, has proposed to the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which, apparently, will be approved in the next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to be in this position, that we выдадим someone a license, and then it would cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our city voted against the amendments.</seg>
<seg id="46">And now we see a contradiction between the local voting and the results, voted for that state.</seg>
<seg id="47">There are still many unresolved questions.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">How much I remember myself, I always dreamed to go to Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world educational institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, закладывающий two foundations of civilization - freedom and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">And yet, after two weeks of studies on the Faculty вустерского college at Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed up and left, resulting in the first real scandal in my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father did not survive and burst into tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">Friends have been disoriented.</seg>
<seg id="8">The evening standard newspaper claimed that I threw the College, because I didn't like it, that my однокурсники sex in the next room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left, because I had to drink from щербатых Cups.</seg>

<seg id="10">In fact it was not so funny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I ran, because systematically hounded and intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied in a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I hounded for only one reason, and in this the cradle просвещенности it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow уайэтт was known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">You ask, why to remember about this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the latest data, a new generation of students, придерживающееся center-right views, is subject to the same harassed.</seg>
<seg id="17">This институционализированная and constantly growing hatred студентам-консерваторам in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as the one who is disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation only compounded released recently on BBC two documentary about politics in a student environment "country wonders: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives have presented eccentric and neo-Nazi.</seg>
<seg id="21">The film was shown Joe cooke, a former President of the Association of Oxford University conservatives, who travelled to роллс-ройсе wears a silver suit and stick with silver набалдашником.</seg>

<seg id="26">"This is a threat to both for atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for a normal life members of the club," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was one.</seg>

<seg id="30">The year before, University of voting deprived former студентку Margaret Thatcher her an honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.</seg>
<seg id="31">In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even сталинистам.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week первокурсника, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I first heard that I waited ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">I still didn't know that teachers not only looked at glide intend direct persecution against студентов-консерваторов themselves, but also gladly took part in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political issues - the miners' strike, the privatization of government and opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through обшитые wooden panels wall audiences.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first seminar I needed to translate eighteenth-century French text in English, and I was not ready for the fact that followed it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss уайэтт," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "Please, put it the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">The text was for me, I hardly запиналась.</seg>

<seg id="43">I returned to my room quite miserable.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the evening in College I was sitting at dinner one; then someone clapped me on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was James, second-year student in the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of conservative University.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47"> "Unfortunately, things are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="48">Over every, who are suspected of supporting the Conservatives, will get me down.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="50">They most первокурсников-консерваторов pretend to labour."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to face it.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I not with all that says Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trick didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="54">The freshman at the Faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You daughter fascist pigs.</seg>
<seg id="55">You are catching."</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students picked up his words.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was a flawed, dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"As the Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.</seg>
<seg id="59"> "They колотят each other, right?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like, should be felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.</seg>
<seg id="61">Will I ever live a normal life in Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night?</seg>
<seg id="63">If I am forced to become лейбористкой and hide their real beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="64">The coming three years I have become seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman stone, a professor of modern history.</seg>
<seg id="66">He hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on issues of foreign policy and one of her спичрайтеров.</seg>
<seg id="67">In college, he almost did not appear.</seg>
<seg id="68">He despised him for provinciality мелочность and commitment to марксистско-детерминистскому view on history.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of билкент in Ankara, Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"Here you won't be happy," he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among непредвзятых capital's friends and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained why.</seg>
<seg id="73">He didn't believe me.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his studies from 1940 to 1948 years there were any political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it is also the best University in the world," he said жалобно.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">I was изнурена regular trips to London and my emotional protection weaker.</seg>
<seg id="83">My friend, also a conservative, did not survive the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="84">Next week during the seminar, when another teacher history quite seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the soul сгорая from shame, I admitted that "I clean brains parents" and called them "the old fools."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Respite was short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="87">The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was going to kill my father.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time he wrote every week for two columns for publications ïðèíàäëåæàùèõ руперту мердоку.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I did take, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they left, I packed my suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can call me плаксой and cloth.</seg>
<seg id="94">But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.</seg>
<seg id="95">The печальнее that it was Oxford, which not only released 14 Tory prime ministers, but to this day is behind the незаслуженной reputation of the university, in which value equality and freedom.</seg>

<seg id="1">The most difficult profession in the world: miners with кавах-иджена</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The four euro Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, втаскивая 70 kilograms of sulfur on top of a volcano on steep каменистым trails</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people, for which their work - hell, and others are literally in hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among them are anto widjaja, one of 400 miners who make a living mining of sulphur in the top of a volcano кавах-иджен, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every day anto comes down on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of earth solidifies when in contact with air.</seg>
<seg id="6">отколов huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on their shoulders and carries up to a precipitous rocky road.</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to the top of the volcano, whose height is 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but изможденным грузчикам requires more than 40 minutes to climb черепашьим step, with difficulty keeping balance and carefully нащупывая road, not to оступиться and not fall from cliff.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that one wrong step could cost them life, as happened with one туристкой from France, which started several years ago with rocks кавах-иджена.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Miners with кавах-иджена earn 5 евроцентов for every kilogram of sulfur, which are mined</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Once at the top, they pave a road between туристами, who photographed them, as if they were apes from circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, are three kilometers to scale that mining company расположила slightly higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is about PT Kandy нгримби, enterprise, which has been running since 1960 the volcano, and it is best not to say, of its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 евроцентов) for every kilogram of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then it it sells over 10,000 rupees (83 евроцентов) petrochemical industrial plants, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"As the norm is переноска 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each ходку," explains us anto, which usually performs three daily carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this seems мизером for such нечеловеческого efforts, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.</seg>
<seg id="16">"поденная платня шахтерам very high by local standards, where coffee for collecting pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains грузчик, who previously worked as a bricklayer in tourist island of Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There his salary was just rupees (6.2 euros) per day and plot was not such a hard, but anto returned with his family to Indonesia in баньюванги town not far from the volcano on a valid reason, which is the same as massive, sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java, she took to Islam."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, he's breathing with difficulty, continual cough, and he has constantly слезятся eyes due to toxic gases</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In my 27 years anto spent three years, risking a кавах-иджене sulfur which is already beginning to take a toll on it despite the presence of masks and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has asthma, he's breathing with difficulty, continual cough, and he has constantly слезятся eyes due to toxic gases, which produces volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.</seg>
<seg id="22">"поработаю two more years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises to more than an acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be tourist guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of mule.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dividing dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he gets up every day in two hours of night, because the sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow turns into a blue and glittering among the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="25">Challenging the shadow, anto down in a crater, covering a road, a small Lantern подсоединенным to his каске, which he bought for their money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 porters being dragged basket with Gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Despite the high profits, the mining company not механизировала sulphur production for cost savings and does not provide any equipment носильщикам, who work at its own expense and with such deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, they are not even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for the picture collection, which, along with incoming ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its людей-мулов.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work for cattle, and not for the people," said бадрусин, a stocky носильщик 42 years, who spent on кавах-иджене three decades since he left college.</seg>
<seg id="30">Able to raise up to 110 pounds, he assures that will endure the work "as much as can," because he needs money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Don't retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although the sulfur is burning throat and жжет eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense pillars of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so Hardy, that no one complains about its severe disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, артрозы, pain in his knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which деформировались under the weight of baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Balance the basket on his back, унайник now only can raise 50 kilogram in his 53 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his comrades are 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck carrying on a warehouse in тамансари, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on a narrow path among зарослей.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Don't retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says унайник, widely opening your mouth, in which several teeth missing.</seg>
<seg id="36">One of his five children, senior, 30 years, also runs a viral host sulphur.</seg>

<seg id="13">Many of these ideas may have been innovative, but not necessarily worked.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought, why not make the most creative thing as possible, in order to solve this problem, namely compose rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 child</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who don't take it so lightly – is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">It spends $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm for the birth of a greater number of children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs aizraujošu maternity and provide tax relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But all of this has low efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich and high-tech государство-город in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of his leadership and its strict public control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Fertility rates in Singapore, according to his national management on the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why singaporeans do not have more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tang Wei Min, Director of Policy on to couples and families of the national office for population, says that the reason "better education" and "more than a wide range of career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family formation," she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in social norms boosted the number of singles and postponement of marriages and births, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at boosting the immigration to oppose the reduction of the population, causing resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are websites where flourishes barely скрываемая xenophobia in relation to many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which has been criticized for maintaining wages at a low level, and reluctance to integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that last year, Singapore's ruling party received the worst result in elections since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the elections was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the decline in fertility has known impact on economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is making efforts to not built up so much ìàëåíüêîãî housing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">For example, it is the impact on the real estate sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">A guide to urban development has shifted to control number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.</seg>

<seg id="37">However, it is believed that they can contribute to холостому lifestyle and deprived of their incentive housing developers who want to build a large family.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim yū домостроительной sun, General Director of the developers, said that their "обувные boxes" sold much faster than the more spacious copies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are more popular, in the sense that these apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a result, our cash revenues increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who previously put tape, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too перенапряженные</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore, a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing national fertility, after talking with сингапурцами, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems, that they will not have much effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"People are very перенапряжены, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people this delay," says the young administrator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Other people can have children.</seg>
<seg id="47">"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them to have children.</seg>

<seg id="51">Do you know what others publish about you?</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Mortality from Aids today is the result of a late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I like оглушили," he recalls the difficult, despite all the time with a doctor, moment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young man hide it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having decided to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fabrizio - one of the oldest patients "" вич-отделения hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hcg), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He lives with the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) "for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe - then there was too little treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even so, Director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him," because he had a cut."</seg>
<seg id="9">In other words, in those times have AIDS was a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and do this without worsening the quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, not knowing about his illness, many people still come, when the virus has already damaged the," истощил "their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases," a great achievement for the moment is that the patient's survival, which starts treatment in a timely manner, and survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the вич-отделения hcg, Jaime andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that the information has been confirmed by in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">инфекционист and expert on HIV/AIDS, andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the extent of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best expected duration of life, those who are not drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 cd4, and up to 50 years, when reports about 500 cd4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In short, this means that whoever gets the diagnosis вич-положительного at the age of 25 years, according to these terms," while maintaining control, can live up to 75 years without problems," he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To assess this progress, we should remember that Mexicans today in the average life expectancy is 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients died in the national database.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by May this year; however, argues that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> - Why there is still летальные outcomes?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">So I can imagine it themselves as things stand in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least the last 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don't know about its инфицированном state, that is, in the later stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He brought сокрушительные data: "nine out of ten patients come when already have some оппортунистическую infection; what you need to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and we need to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people that it will be asked."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In his motion agree experts and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in Jalisco (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to check into the private lab побужденный only in that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even stradal саркомой kaposi cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some people think that will die, and did not want to know.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I die, I will be better still надираться three times a week," they say. But not in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are positive changes, I well питаюсь do exercise, take drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I have many lessons, I travel, have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, care about yourself and the other person," I have enumerated Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with milenio Jalisco to prompt his statement of those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Let проверятся, if there was the risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are infected, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know they can live as any other person, being responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is his report summarizes the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Big gap between programs in health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which started a problem with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the biggest is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In places, devoted to this task," actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, we now offer packages to 100, and it is very good, but now it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Among the most vulnerable to the new infections are teenagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why do you?" is a popular issue, with ехидством and condemnation, from the social workers, school staff consultants, pharmacies and health workers, who did not want to hear teenagers, assured advocate.</seg>
<seg id="39">Propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for прилавками and to sotnia them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places, who often attends youth.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not promoting promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not about the payment of beer and motel, said Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, is the distribution of condoms possible under his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It's not sexy, it is best to make condoms available to those who already practicing sexual activity," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key Data in Jalisco</seg>

<seg id="18">Bar-tov then recommended снайпера Raymond Carl Friedrich gauss, which received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">чемпионством cowboys with гауссом I enjoyed, but already at a distance, because to 1988 was the head of the Federation.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Without doubt, this was пикулин ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His performance at international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as it did пикулин.</seg>
